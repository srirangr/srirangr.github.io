<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Dhingra</u><br><br>Got to know this guy in first year when we were both in B Section, he being a <b>Dulla <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b> and me being an ECE guy. Since then its always been fun talking to this guy, he is the quintessential nice guy, talking to him always gives you a nice feeling. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Banda TT ka to bond hai, has got so many points for Prithvi all these years, his must be one of the major part in Prithvi house becoming the overall champion 3 years in a row <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Bechare ke sath hamesha TT Singles mein chot ho jati thi, glad that he finally did it in 4th year. Cheers to you buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I dunno why but we hav had plenty of conversations about the kids these days, and how tech savvy and advanced they are getting <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Will always remember the convo we had when we were getting back from sumwhere in a bus and we were sitting in a bus, cursing the kids these days about being so involved in gadgets and losing on their childhood <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Don't even remember how old this convo is.<br><br>Since the time he bought the bike, he has been a great help. My helmet was lost, and everytime I had to go out, I would just go and knock on his door and ask for his helmet <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the very best for your MS and life ahead.<br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dhingra was among the first people I interacted with in IIIT, in virtue of being his wing mate. The first time I meet him, he tells me about all is exploits in badminton, tt and athletics. I though, jarur koi stud banda hoga. Back then, we used to hang out a lot together in Khatri's room. The stud waala image slowly faded away because of the amount he was leofied <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But well, hes definitely among the best TT and badminton players we have. He's won quite a few laurels in this field. <br><br>He is always pissed off about his work, and I hope he gets his MS degree soon. Fir IIM-A join kar lena <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . These days, he has a stud-waala bike <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , and thanks for all those times when you've given us your helmet. <br><br>May God bless!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Well, if there exists a word that defines him, it is - passion. One of the earliest friends I made in IIIT, Dhingra, is one of the most passionate guys I've come across in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. The perfect embodiment of an undergrad college guy. Good at studies, even better at sports (as a player and spectator), and second to none when it comes to doing BC. He is one with a very soft heart which is obvious given his passion. A Proud owner of a Yamaha FZ-16, prefers to use public transport, keeping his machine in the shed <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Dhingra is absolutely mad, quite literally,(and I mean it) about movies. Snapping his fingers with great vigor , turns up in my room every Friday asking (almost pleading) for me to go watch a movie with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>I am amazed by his I-don't-care-a-dime attitude and his self-belief <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. No matter what, he would always follow his heart. A really smart and intelligent bloke who puts his heart and soul in every thing he does. He has been a great  source of inspiration for me in this regard. Always the one who revs things up. He is one of the few guys bubbling with positive energy.<br><br>He is really passionate, here comes the word again, about his friends and would presumably do anything for them <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Shares a great camaraderie with his pals.<br><br>We've had a roller coaster ride all these years and have shared some of the most memorable moments in college <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. There've been some differences between us but that is expected in a long relationship such as this. Hope you stay the way you are and achieve great success in all your future (and present) endeavors.<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Comes in to my wing, striking his fingers together chit-chit chit-chit and shouts maaaaaaaaaaaaks from the start of the wing 'movie chalna hai kya'. Uske baad mujhe pata hai ki mere paas aayega for movie. To lure me he used to say sab chal rahe hai. When i ask kon kon he says mai mridul aur tu. When I ask konsi jaa rahe hai he says some random movie never heard before. Basically all together i want to say is that he is big fan of watching movies. Kabhi bhi chale jaao kabhi mana nahin karta.<br><br>First year mai c ke codes ka ye ek bada source hua karta tha. I used to count him like anything. Kahin se nahin mila to dhingra de hi dega. I still count him the same for help. <br><br>I know in some ocassions i have pissed him. Lekin badi jaldi he forgets things in past and rejoins with spirit. He had shared almost everything with me in first two years. His innocence, simplicity and passion for sports have impressed me a lot. Iske dil mai jo kuch hota hai wo muh pe keh deta hai.<br><br>He is best TT player of our college. I have always enjoyed his game in finals for last 3 years. Thoda tense ho jata hai while playing. Bich mai basket ball ka bhi chaska chada tha lekin kabhi basket karte nahin dekha <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Man, be the same forever. Good luck for MS. Kabhi hamare hitech flat mai tashreef lana <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mera dullu bhai, Dhingra is the best TT player in the college. Quite hard working and dedicated towards everything he do. We are not great friends but whatever time we have interacted, its quite clear from that that he is very nice hearted and helpful. He always greets you whenever you see him and has this spirit associated with him which is kinda coool. If you see him plating volleyball, you'll notice that he is not a good player but this never stopped him from trying and he came daily to play. This never-say-die spirit is someting which makes him stand out.<br><br>Good luck for your MS. Apan to saath hi rehne wale hain to shayad aur testimonials aate rahenge. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><center><b>Dhingra - The SPORTSTAR</b></center><br>He is one of the all-rounder in our batch.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is excellent in many sports viz. TT, Badminton etc.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> And his hands have got very hard playing such games. If he pats me on my back, it feels terrible <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> and I feel that it is time for me to leave the body.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In spite of such hard hands, he has a very soft heart.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is a great friend of mine. I find him always there to help me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Once, I decided to visit Mahabaleshwar, Panchagani etc during summer vacations. No one agreed to come with me except this guy who did not wish to disappoint me.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> The last example clearly mentions how a great friend he is.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /> He is not only a great friend of mine but also a great adviser who advises me - How to behave in a specific situation, What to do and What not to do etc.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>We have one nice thing in common -- Whatever we feel about something, we speak out and don't keep it within our hearts. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He loves going to movie hall every friday chahe koi si bhi movie lage. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He loves to live in style and that's why he often experiments with his dressing and hair cut.<br>He has also started building his body by doing regular excercise (waise body ise apne purkhon se mili hai, aisa iska kehna hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>We have our MS degree under same guide and I hope we would enjoy doing our MS.<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>At the end, I wish you complete your MS by 2010 and also help me in completing mine.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br>Wish you a great future.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dhingru bhai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... aaj bhi mere mobile mein Hemanth likha hai insted of Hemant <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Jo bhi ho bande ke pass khoob paisa hai aur bahut aish se reh raha hai IIIT mein <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . MS jaldi karke MBA ki soochi hai isne, I hope watever u thought may come true. Hamesha aise hi rehna, never try to change urself. Best of Luck for ur future.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Cheerful, full of energy, fun, always found him laughing or in a jolly mood. First thing I<br>remember about him is him finishing 8 out of 10 problems in programming assignment 5 in first semester on the first day itself!<br>He is a movie buff and its fun talking to him about movies. He likes to watch movies in big screen and used to go watch movies almost every week, be it desi bollywood movie, till last year. He is a big fan of Akki and watches all his<br>movies.<br>He likes to talk about the contrast between his life in Delhi to his life in IIIT. We've had some good time chatting about our younger days.<br>He possesses all the good qualities of a Delhite. He is humble and soft spoken.<br>He has smart cool dude looks and likes to experiment on short hair styles.<br>He is awesome when it comes to TT and badminton. He does get quite excited, though, while playing but is a good and honest sportsman.<br>He is quite ambitious and likes to work hard towards his goal or passion, be it reducing his waist size or practicing TT to win the first position (everytime he ended up in second position, except this year!), or towards his<br>future plans! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his jolly mood and cheerful nature.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dhingra my wing mate, the athelte, researher <img src=Smileys/10.gif />,TT Bond and probably the biggest fan of cricket in IIIT <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. IPL ke samay humne kai match ek saath dekhe hain. I always used to ask him "who's this player,which team it belong etc.etc." and he is always ready with the answer <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Maglu ki saaath milke lene mein bahut mazza aata hain,as I need some hard-core fact for that, and he is always ready with that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Apart from cricket, another thing we share is our addiction of listening bollywood movie songs. Hamesha we buzz each other about any new songs or which song is playing in your room <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Is a big fan of hindi movies/serials. Always try to watch the movie in the hall <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is the one who told us about <b>Dulla</b> for MS students <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and is happy when someone tells him that he is one of them <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>All the best for MS yaar, hopefully you will complete that in a year and start something of your own. Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your passion about doing something<br>Most Memorable moments : -BC during Power cut in our wing.<br>Msg for U: - Keep up the spirit dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dhingra ji se mulakaat hui jab hamare interaction chal rahe the seniors se,pahli baar agar kisi bande se confidently suna ki raat ko kya kya hota hai bando ke saath toh woh tha hamara dhigra,aur isse ek nayi term suni jo shayad mere alawa sabko pata thi.. aur woh hai NF(Yahan nahi likh sakta full form.<img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>Hum dosto mein sabse active banda,kaisi bhi movie ho bas tayaar hall mein dekhne ko,had hai yaar kuch movie toh naam dekh kar bhi reject kar diya kar....<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Very good at heart,determined to do whatever he thinks but point is his thinking changes every moment.....<br>Kabhi gym jakar weight kam karna hai toh agle din weight badana hai,par har time kuch na kuch mission rahta hai bande ka.<br>Aaj ke jamane mein subah 4 baje uth kar kaun padta hai batao batao....... u guessed it right,what a man he is...<br>Banda ka shopping style bada pasand hai mujhe,soch lega ki bas yeh lena hai toh lena hai,recently he has bought a cool google and he looks like his favourite akshay kumar on wearing it.Money no bar for him.<br>The rider of Yamaha FZ-16 is witty,quick thinker, a steadfast....<br>Bhai jitna proud apne dehli wale dosto par hai utna hum sab par bhi rakhna....<br>Milte rahenge aage bhi abhi toh bas shuruwat hai...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dhingra and Mux awesome combo hain dono ka. He is a very cool guy. I remember the days in first year when he used to share pc with me at times. All the nicknames he used to keep were funny <b>Mangal</b> for Bharat Ram and fatoo for *** <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is a very confident guy plans on building a perfect body but lacks the dedication.<br><br>I wish you good luck and i hope that you definitely pursue your MBA dream after this MS degree.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>well our journey starts from day 0, we met in the train to IIIT and then were room-mates for 2 yrs <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....<br>he is a movie freak...fond of watching every damn hindi movie which is released....even if he knows that movie is a shit....but as is his committment, he would still watch it...and sometimes manages to watch a complete movie in half-hour <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>we had common interests in TT and i admire his skills <img src=Smileys/77.gif />....this guy is a real sportsperson...has been in sports since his childhood days <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>he has a sharp acumen nd yet he is humble....<br>and yeah he is soo fond of purchasing clothes...you just can't fathom the thought of even having so many clothes and yet having the apetite to purchase more.....<br><br>wud remember those first yr days when we wud try escaping raggin....almost always unsuccessfully...<br>good luk and hope u finish ur MS in 1 yr nd then MBA as well !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dhingra, as we call him is one of the best athlete I've ever seen in my life.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> During the first two years he for me was the best TT player of our batch....    But during the third year we really got to know each other.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  We went out so many times...  specially to Siddiqui. A health freak he is always trying to improve his physique ( though he has an excellent one  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....  His determination could be found out by the fact that he was the one who used to wake around 10 guys for gym every morning at 5 30....  <br>He cud be seen at every sports event of iiit....  be it bb house matches or batch matches....   his enthusiasm in those matches wud always be very high no matter which team is wining as he wud always appreciate sports.... He also likes to go out a lot...  specially when there are new highly hyph-ed bollywood movies....  He is also a big fan of reality tv series Roadies and splitsvilla ( as he watches these shows after finding out who will be voted out <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> )  But still after doing all these things he always manages to find time for studying... I know that when we wakes up early to go for gym he always devotes around 1 hr for studying first <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Such combo is very rare to find who is gud in sports, studies and is still doing BC most of the time... He also likes to try new Hair cuts(Ghajini cut <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) and styles... and looks like he is ready to go for a party everytime <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...  A very gud person at heart, he wud always tell you what he is feeling at once without keeping it from you.... I wud always remember those bb matches with you where you will leave everybody shocked with your defense... those outings where we wud talk abt all of our friends ( we both like gossiping a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )...  <br>Best of luck for your future...   Keep Rocking Dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
