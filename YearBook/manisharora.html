<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Manish aka Jaat aka Chu**ya Bachha aka Hara*an Putri Savitri aka Dassi</u><br><br>I didnt know the guy too much in the first two years, all that time I just knew him as roomie of Chand, a fodu par excellence, and a guy who would cry a lot when it came to academics. Nobody would ever forget the Physics incident when he literally cried with tears in his eyes and finally scored the highest marks in the whole batch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Iski abhi tak is baat pe li jati hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> My interactions with him during the first two years were quite restricted to very few times when I would come to Chand's room. I distinclty remember cursing Chand at times coz his room used to stink a lot only to be told that it was due to this guy and true to his reputation his room still stinks a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Coming to third year, that's when our interaction started, I remember that the room allotted to his was originally allotted to Maruti and then Piyush was supposed to come in that room. So, when he came to the room, I was a bit disappointed as I wasnt too friendly with him them. But we gelled almost instantly when he was my wing mate in 3rd year. I will always remember the endless BC we (Chand, him and Me) used to do, and all the night outs we did which frustrated Vipul a lot and the next day he would curse our lot for not letting him have a peaceful sleep <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>Then came Microsoft internship which took our relation to a new level, ist when I really found a friend in Manish. The endless BC we did in Microsoft, having all our meals together, going for lunch, snacks and dinner. All the time we waited for Adi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Meeting <b>Watermelon</b> and laughing on her face <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Staring at all the hot chicks in MS... MSIT wali yaad hai na <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Then the MS party <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I don't think you will ever be able to forget it, and mujhe kuch khas yaad nahin hai uska <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> All the foosball games we played, how you always used to win courtesy that andhi shot you used to play which was illegalised later <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> All the fights between you and Adi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All those lunches when me & adi used to eat Pasta and you would stick with  the old & faithful DOSA :| All those times you used to urge us to go to Building 2 but me and Adi used to be satisfied with Building 3 jahan hum to pasta kha lete the but tera kat jata tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All those holidays when we went to MS just to play TT & Foosball. How can we forget BYCTW day jab Adi ki wajah se humara kat gaya tha and T-Shirt nahin mil payi thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And ofcourse wo IIT-Delhi wali jo mujhe pakati thi and phir uske baad tum logon ne jo meri li thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (and ofcourse admiring her figure <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) Cursing IIIT ki bandiyan jo wahan pe bhi <b>"you know kaisi"</b> rehti thi :| Hum dono mil ke adi ko jo pakate the <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All the maazas and hot chocolates we shared <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All those rides back home on my activa and those struggles between u n adi to come with me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And ofcouse your last day at MS jab hum tripling karke aye the <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I will feel so odd when I wont find you guys when working in the company <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>contd...<br>Then came fourth year which again added another chapter to our relation <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All those times Maroo and Me would leofy you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Irritating u atleast 50 times each and every day <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I cant tell hw much I enjoy irritating you. And I dont think you will forget the day I irritated you the most, that day was really legendary <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Most awesome part was, when he later told me, <b>"Aaj tak zindagi mein kabhi mere sar mein dard nahin hua but aaj pehli baar hua courtesy you <img src=Smileys/14.gif />"</b>. But the most memorable thing about it was, the next day he got the call from MS, confirming him as a FTE of MS <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Which also reminds me of the grand party in <b>Little Italy</b> thrown by him, which is by far the most expensive party we have had (including the booze ones <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) The bill that day was 6400 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sala 4th year mein mujhe aur Chand ko smoking ki adat lagi to is bande ko passive smoking ki adat lag gayi. Whenever Chand and me smoked in the wing, sala ye sutte ki smell soonghta hua bahar aa jata tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> 4th year mein will remember all those nights we used to do BC before CAT and subah uth ke Maroo hum teenon ki class leta tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>The guy might have won the world, batch topper, 10 pointer, Microsoft but he is the most kiddish person I have seen in college. If you poke him once, he wont rest until he has done the same to you. Banda jab chidhta to hansi dekhne layak hoti hai iski, anybody looking at him can tell he is not feeling comfortable but manne ko taiyar nahin hota kabhi :| One of the ROFLest thing about him is the dance he keeps doing time and again. I cant describe it in words but you should just see him doing all those dance steps <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I can assure you, its literally Roll on the floor laughing stuff <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> MUjhe hamesha ek baat ka afsos rahega ki 4 saal mein group mein sabko daru pila di, but is kameene ne kabhi nahin pi.. Sala Club 8 gaya bhi to mocktail pi kar aa gaya <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best.. aise hi phodum phadi machate rehna..<br><br><b>Song for you : Chhota bachha jane ke humko<br>An Advice : Grow up you KID</b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Manish Arora aka jaat aka phodu ...<br><br>It's a great honour to wirte a testimonial for this gentleman<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is a gem of a guy, an outstanding person, an extraordinary simple guy who believes in doing only good things. It's been four years with him now and I couldn't be able to figure out even one wrong or bed characteristic of him<img src=Smileys/20.gif />. I really respect him for whatever he do. I visit his room very often(can say twice in a day) he always suggests me do right things and that really motivates me a lot<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>Nowdays, he is known as "novirus", because of his odd way of playing CZ<img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He is a multi-talented guy, jis bhi cheej me ek baar ghus jata hai ushe complete karke hi chodta hai, be it gaming, studies, playing volleyball, body building, gossiping<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is a kind of person, who believes himself, never cared what people thinks about him, but he do things which he likes, saale ko kitna force kiya hoga logon ne peene ke liye but nahi to nahi ...<br><br>The "Micro"<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> man helped many batchmates at the time of placement by teaching them several subjects..and I believe that ki is bande se jyada achchi OS koi nahi pada sakta IIIT me<img src=Smileys/77.gif />.. he deserves to be a batch topper indeed!!!  <br><br>Jab bhi main isse milta hun aur baat karta hun, ye kuch naa kuch aisa bolta hai jisse main iski naa chahe ke bhi ishi ke samne isiki taarif kar hi deta hun aur ye bhi sochta hun ki .. koi kaisa itna achcha ho sakta hai<img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .. seriously manish, I feel very proud to have you as one of the closest buddy around here.<br><br>keep in touch !!!<br>may you fly higher in future.<br>still much more fun than ever has to come in your life!!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>someone asked me a question, "who will you admire in our batch?" and my answer was ... this lad - jaat, sindi. If there is some meaning to the term 'bond' .. he totally justifies it. Great acads, great placement, great attitude towards anything, a very nice TT player. But this is not just what sindi is .. he is a friend you'll regret not knowing. BC to chahe jitni karwa lo .. always ready ... phatte ka jo level hai .. wo sirf main hi match kar pata hu ... and when we're together .. log paagal ho jate hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We've had quite some laughter sessions at my room .. dono 1-dusre ke phatte ko bura bolenge aur phir dono hi pet pakad pakad kar hasenge <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. that was fun.<br>This guy is always ready to help anyone.. has taught OS so many times and to so many people that he can tell you topics by pagenumber .. and seriousli all through my MS interview I was thanking him for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>There are manythings that people have written like never say die attitude, always wants to be best at everything he does .. so I dont want to repeat it. He has done everything in college life ... after getting placed he went to synthesizer class, played VB, played TT, played CZ .. and did whatever he was losing while studying .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. great job buddy.<br>Message for him : I know you wont forget me ... so nothing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Song for him: Rock on!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

I used to find atleast 10 people who were ready to play FIFA 07 anytime but i always asked manish if he wants to play because i really enjoyed it.

Sometimes haste huye  u can see very clearly that he is not actually enjoying it but still just for the sack of  other's intentions, he gives him the kind of company what the other person is expecting.<br><br>Bus yaar, bahut hi uniform relation raha humara, no ups and downs and we both liked it in that way .<br><br>Chal yaar....Good luck kahne ki jaroorat nahi hai, tu vaise bhi bahut hi successfull hone wala hai future main...but bhool mat jayiyo..vaise main bhoolne doonga nahi as long as you are in Microsoft, roz aa jaya karoonga tang karne...<br><br> Shaadi par bulana mat bhoolna.

VB mein toh apni team mein spike karta hain , service awesome karta hain,altough we loose few games here and there, but overall fodu types ki BC ho jaati hain.CZ mein toh aisa lagta hain energybooster pi ke aaya hain, hamesha dodta rehta hain, bechare bansi ko bakra bnata hain mujhe maarne ke liye <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I enjoy playing cz these days because of you and bansi <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and lol comments <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>  Baki logon ne likh hi diya hain but I still I have to mention abt his dedication abt task he take in hand or decides to do. Recent example is of GYM, bhai sahab do-teen ghante tak lage rehte hain GYM mein <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Placement ke samay OS ka kya tute liya tha, just mindblowing, 2-3 class mein poora cover kar liya tha ki kya zaroori hain aur kya nahin. TT bhi khub khela hain iske saaath. He is good player and excellent partner for doubles <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  MS is really lucky to have you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Best of luck for your career in MS, hope you will continue to excel in every step of your life <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br><br>Lastly <br><br>for you <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

This is all possible only because of dedication. That's what I call "Kasi" <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Also his dedication for gym can also be seen by having a good look at his body.

Whenever we saw each other we spoke about something or the other and not that our friendship was just limited to "Hi! and Bye!". And tell you what, this guy is full of energy. I'm very much amazed to see how he manages to do all things and still puts up a very cheerful smile on his face. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>Coming to the dance thing in first year.

<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Memorable moments include me discovering the instant lifting of his hand as soon as someone puts a hand on his shoulder. Thanks to his orange full shirt, I coined his nick - sindhi and some of us still call him by that name. Then there were the workout sessions at the gym which are totally unforgettable - measuring weights, pull-ups, learning to skip rope, support on bench-press, endless BC with Khatri n Co and finally juice at Pintoo's. Also his funny gestures have given me ample opportunities  to leofiy his arse anytime. Another memory includes his sending me a reconciliation mail after we had a fight in our room.

If there exists a term such as an ideal son, it would definitely be him. I cant imagine Manish troubling his folks at any point in his life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of the rare ones who has not touched booze or ciggi amongst us. You have my respect for that brother. Commitment comes naturally to him, be it acads, gym, CZ,TT. Giving cent percent and being the best are his keen driving forces. Principles come naturally to him and he has the guts to abide by them.<br><br>In the first year, I wrote a one page description of Manishin the English class which was fun. Somebody told me that he turns his back when Maruti plays porn on his system which was hilarious really. A total bond from the starting when it comes to studies, Manish is extremely intelligent, logically correct and fodu at Maths. Whenever I used to have any kind of doubt, I used to go to him without any hesitation. He has explained me atleast n number of concepts <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Especially during the placement period he was a great support and a great help. It is a delight to get concepts from Manish.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>The self control that he exercises is really commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. When people used to watch stuff on Maruti's PC in workspace in 1st year this guy never even bothered to turn back and sincerely did coding sitting just behind that PC. He is the only one in our group who has abstained from drinking alcohol (though his red eyes tell just the opposite tale<img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and I really admire him for that <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br>One more thing about him is that he wants to be a hero. Sometimes passing by his room one can see him dancing with complete actions and emotions on songs from Krissh <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He even gets irritated easily when leofied at <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> which can be easily seen by a change in his way of smiling and by his act of physically suppressing the one who tries to make fun of him. But still everyone around him esp. Bhalu, Budhdha and Maroo enjoy teasing him and watching his reaction to that. Sometimes when he has nothing to BC about he would just pick some random song from some super-flop movie of 90s which one would have not heard since ages and start singing and then everyone around him would be like ... WTF ! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> . He also has some previously formed notions about somethings and sticks to them. Here I would advice him to be little flexible and to see other side of things as well.<br><br>He is really a kid by nature who never keeps ill-feeling  against anyone and really pure at heart. Some of my favourite memories associated with him are - grand outing in 1st sem, BC sessions in NBH-47, dance party in his wing in 3rd sem, Graphics tutes, my accident on last Holi when he stood by me all day long in hospital (thanx a lot for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), OS tutes during placements, phattes in gym (esp. the Metallica one) <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, volleyball near CS and many more.<br><br>Microsoft is really lucky to have you Manish and you will surely take it to new heights.<br>All the best for your future.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Manish aka Jaat is one of those guys of our batch who has transformed himself a lot in the past four years. Still remember the good old days of first year when I used to visit Chand and his room, I used to always find him studying and fared not to interrupt so as to provoke his anger. At those times our interaction was just limited to mere 'hi' and 'bye'. But after the formation of TB we got to know each other more and more and now it feels really great to have a friend like him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>From a studious guy in first year to a total sports freak, this guy has achieved perfection in almost each and every field that he has tried his hand at. I would say he is perfection personified. One must see his attitude towards approaching things. He is never scared of any challenge and hates losing. Has this confidence that he can be the numero uno, which eventually he does through persistent hard work. Be it working out in gym, playing TT, badminton, volleyball, CS, FIFA or public speaking, he has proved his mettle in all. This is for his never say die spirit <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  which has really been inspirational for others.<br><br>Always manages to keep a smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> which is the best part. It's really great to be in his company as he lightens the atmosphere around him with his short phattes <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Initially I used to get irritated a lot with his phattes and felt like I should just seal his mouth but now with him being around and not cracking any PJs it feels like something is lacking. <br>A total brainee, which is quite evident from his academic feats in these four years. Used to study a lot till 2nd year when he realized that whether he studies or not he will end up getting an A/A-. He was our 'crack the interview' during the <br>placements and helped us a lot through the OS tutes and helping in every other possible way he could have.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i> Part 2 </b></i><br><br>But not just in the academic sphere, Manish absolutely loves to excel in whatever he does. You got to watch him playing tabletennis. Or volleyball. Or gymming. Or public speaking. He has to be the best, and can go any lengths to achieve his goal. He hates losing, and it is this attitude which I love about him. Its this attitude which will take him ahead in whatever he does. Its not that he consiously does this, but this attitude is ingrained in him. However, <br>along with this comes a problem. Though hes a quick learner, he often does not listen to what others have to stay. Far too often for his own good, he is too rigid on what he thinks. I think he needs to be much more flexible.<br><br>Manish also likes playing by the rules, in whatever aspect it is. He does not like to meander and will never 'stray' too much. Hes the only teetoaller in the group. I admire his resistance to temptation. He'll rarely do something which goes against the rules. He is the only guy whos been locking his room everytime <br>he goes out (be it for a couple of minutes) right from first year on. Or consider his attitude towards girls. I have a feeling that he'd never do <i>anything</i> which'll even remotely hurt his folks. Once again, this aspect of his is so very admirable.<br><br>My first impressions of Manish as Chand's roomie was as this guy who was always smiling. Come mid sems 1, and one could see his core aspect at work <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . From first year, I'll also take back your scp case, the BCs we would have in Adi's room, the group. Ahh.. Mentioning one more aspect of his- he does not share much regarding his relationships. Not even with his closest pals. He is one of those guys who takes time to open up about himself.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>Manish aka dassi aka jaat is the closest humankind has ever got to academic perfection. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Loaded with oodles of talent, he is one of those guys who'll manage an A or A- even after 'screwing' up his exam. Testimony to the same is the Physics exam in the first year where he cried after the paper on the pretext of failing the course, but ended up being the topper! That was the day when we decided that its futile consoling Manish! The reason being the no-reason to console him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . But hell, whatever be the case, this chap would always stay as focussed on his acads as one could be. Everyone knows about first year, when Maruti's pc would be playing stuff and Manish never ever bothered to turn his head when everyone else was watching. Well, today, if we go <br>back to workspace and the same thing happens again, Manish will not watch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>The wonderful thing is that inspite of his brilliance, he is your next door guy with no airs whatsoever about him.

Having landed with a top notch job himself, he spared no effort in teaching the guys in the group and outside. In fact, I've never seen him turn anyone down from teaching OS. He was always very concerned about us getting placed and did everything he could for the same. We owe it to Manish for our placements!<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Jaat waali koi baat hi nahin, bas ek haryanvi tone zarur hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. I can still remember in my first year when you had to suffer in scp case because of me, somewhere in my heart still feel guilty for it. I was very happy when I heard you have scored ACE in c. <br>I can hardly ever recall him saying 'no' to anyone. You can always ask him for help and he will never refuse. He was the first one to take up placement tute proposal for the batch. Chand is lucky to have you as his room-mate. <br><br>This guy is sincere, sensitive, mature, friendly, helpful and what not... the list is endless dude... I mean by saying that you are an ideal friend, which one would dream off.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Final chapter:<br>Memorable moments, In first year we had an argument over some stuff and I threw my watch in anger and I shouted at him. I was very guilty of being so rude. And after an hour when we clarified the things we both were almost in tears and hugged each other(Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham style!). The second one, when we had this fight over some name thingy during euity pulse , again we had a serious argument and then I mailed him rather then talking to him personally and he mailed me back. We were doing all this sitting infront of the lappies opposite to each other!   When all of a sudden we both decided to complete a Graphics assignment and had a night out coding and laughing at each others output. And all those pillion rides on my bike , when we cursed each other for not having a Girlfriend whenever we crossed a romantic secluded road! and finally all the endless BCs we have had. He has been one of my strongest critics.He made me realize what were my strength and weaknesses. Got to learn a lot from him. Never say die attitude, determination and hardwork. He is heavily responible for me still maintaining a decent CG <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Finally this guy loves Maths, he wanted to do Phd in Mathematics(Hope you will do it someday!). All the very best bhai! Do not leave your "Jaat" killer instinct and stop slapping me for no reason!<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>-still looks incomplete to me, shall write more soon!- <br><br>Cheers!<br>This testimonial still looks incomplete... will update it soon!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>chapter 2:<br><br>A kid at heart, he would come to my room and when he realizes that I am working on something important he would ask me to say "Sorry" otherwise he would switch off the computer! He would secretly dance on the songs of Hrithik Roshan and SRK and would give a seepish smile when caught! He would slap me on my face for no reason, and when asked why did he do that he would reply "aise hi". Aah! Me , him and Himank we have had endless BC sessions and the best part is when we irritate our other early to bed wingies Vipul and Maroo. He gets irritated very easily and when he starts punching you for no reason, you know that he is irritated. He has very strong fundas about life, interesting to listen at times. He is the only one in the group who has never touched alcohol or ciggs(We admire you for that!) though he always has reddened eyes, gives you a feeling as if he is always drunk. We started listening to rock together, thanks to Adi and Pappu. After the class we would play Nirvana in full volume. Remember when we had some guys complaining that the loudness was disturbing a movie shooting in Gachibowli stadium.<br>He doesn't open up easily, but ones you get him out of his shell you will realise how innocent this guy is,oblivious of many things happening around him. I have always treated him like a younger brother, Be it fighting to get a room for him near mine or shouting at him when I am not in my best of moods. As stupid as , going for shopping to get a t-shirt for him, man! one day he tried all the t-shirts of his size available in the showroom but none fit him.  Finally we managed to get one of his size, phew!<br><br>(-contd-)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Chapter1:<br>Chhotu/JAAT<br>On the first day in IIIT, I was searching for a room partner and then I bumped into this guy. I came to know that he was from Hissar(Place where I lived a few years back) and we decided to be roommates. First look, you could say that he was shy and an introvert. He had this funny Haryanvi accent especially when he pronounced the "O" syllable. He was very sincere, regularly attended classes, made notes, he felt that he should work hard as he was one of the last rankers in AIEEE(some early misconceptions!) When I used to come my room after my ragging routine I could find this guy studying. I remember, when we were done with our Physics end sems this guy literally cried , we all were busy consoling him and when the results were out he topped the batch in physics, he topped in first year. He participated in Hindi Debate and won it. <br>Two years later, this guy had totally lost his Haryanvi accent, he knew even if he does not study he could end up getting an A in any subject.Did I say before that he was an introvert and shy. I later realized how wrong I was. Man! his dedication and confidence is worth admiring.<br>The best part is, he wants to improve in everything. Never considers himself to be best in anything. You should see him working out in Gym, I can confidently say that he has the most strenuous routine among all of us( I can see your grin boy!). He started playing TT  and now he is one of the best in the batch. After placements, tried his hand in gaming, played FIFA and now you should see him playing. Never likes to lose, something that is so strong in him.  You should see how happy he gets when he wins a match against Mahavir or Khatri! He told me "Chand I want to get an internship in Microsoft google sunn ke maaza nahin aata" and he ended up getting into Microsoft. One of the sharpest brains I have seen in my life. He has played a major role in all of us getting placed. I used to call him "cracktheinterview". This guy knew all the questions available in the Net!<br><br>(-contd-) </b></i></ul><br><br>
