<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My fellow Vayuite <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Our friendship started with the Fresher's Dance'05. And then the "Chinnamma Chilakamma" and rest is all sports where we were together. Both of us share some common interests like throwball and athletics.<br><br>We have always enjoyed in the Vayu treats to the fullest. May it be the one at Eat Street, or the one at Ohri's Jeeva or the one at Celebrations.. Juniors all are always ready to pull our legs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Wishing you success <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramya.html>Ramya Yaragani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Here is Miss. "Google"an <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is an epitome of hardwork. I bet no one can dedicate themselves to work like she does. Getting up at around 2 or 3 A.M, not sleeping for days are some stuff that shows how determined she is. Also, she never hesitates to help anyone who comes to her asking some doubts.<br><br>She is also good at doing Drama. One of our professor addresses her as "MLA Ramya", for she performed the role of an MLA in a skit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Also good at Carroms too.<br><br>All the very best Rammi da <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Do Wonders at Google <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Spandy... is the name I have given her in the very first year and everyone calls her the same <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One would get the impression of a "calm<br>and innocent" girl after seeing her, but believe me she is neither of the two <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Its all sounds the same if I start talking about her comic skills <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> all over again when most of the people already did.. They can describe her better than me as I stand "speechless" for her oneliners.. Ofcourse, sometimes speechless for the sharpness of her brain and sometimes  speechless just thinking.. "Oh God y me???" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Anupama is the only girl who sincerely likes this girl's so called jokes... Hats off Anu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Spandy is very lazy.. One can surely address her as the "Lazy Lattif".. Whatever might be your proposal to her, be it going to a movie or the pani puri or atleast the coffeeshop... The answer is "Abba opika lede".. We are all tired of listening to her excuses <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Also, she is the person listed next to me in the top-10 list of those who sleep for most of the time <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>She is almost into tears even if she doesn't write a class-test well.. "Asalu baga rayalede" is what she says after every exam. She cannot at<br>all, at any cost and by any means control her excitement whatever the situation might be. Never watch a horror movie along with spandy, even if you watched it earlier or not. Suppose you watched it earlier, then she kills you every minute asking for what happens next which highly irritates the latter and suppose you din't watch it earlier, then you need not watch it any further as spandy reveals out the suspense (infact tries to <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) which almost kills your excitement <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future Spandy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Will definitely miss your one-liners. Keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>What to say about this girl!!! She is one bigggggggg sound-box of the GH 2nd floor... All she needs is some Miss.X (X belongs to ug-2k5 girls) in the wing's corridor or atleast Miss.X's room door open. She just plunges into them with her beautiful <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> "Ooru" slang which irritates<br>the latter the most (atleast "me" the most <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) And do you know what happens if we ask her to stop?? She just gives more of it...<br><br>She generally wakes up very late... rarely has breakfast and very lazy when it comes to getting out of her bed.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Always tries to pull other's legs and can never get bored to chat with someone. She just beats up Anu and Sushu with no reason <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I pity both of them <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>We studied together in 4-1 and she is the one who witnessed me sleeping early the night before the WDKM exam and waking up after she did the next morning... and still she pulls my leg saying I woke up late midnight x-( and studied all the subject and did not even bother to wake her up..Y the damn hell will I do dat Idiot ??? X-(<br><br>Oh yeah..lets now make her feel good by saying few good points about her.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She is always there to help someone in need. She never says a "no" to something we ask for. She has this good habit of asking us if we need something before she goes to the coffeshop <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She helped me many a times with my posts too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>How many good's so far?? 1 2 3 4..omg more than enugh <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Will Miss you divs <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I had so much fun when I am with you... Life is not gonna be the same without you all <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> all the best... you four dualites should keep us posted about all the happenings at IIIT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harshi.. The first word that strikes my mind when I hear this girl's name is "a gifted singer" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is hyperactive, very funny <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and pretty cool.She is always full of energy and does things with great enthusiasm.She is into everything she thinks she can give a try.Dancing, Singing, Carrom, Badminton, and the latest, Throwball and TT too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Be it anything, she just gives her 100%.<br><br>We have been together in many activities at IIIT. It started with Felicity'06 Dance <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We can never forget that experience..The way we danced, the way we looked <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And then the "Chinnamma Chilakamma" performance which we dedicate to our beloved professor Dr.Govindarajulu. And then the Felicity'07. I can never ever forget her sacrifice then.. She dropped out from the dance after some 20-25days of vigorous practice just for me <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> as there were not enough guys to perform then. thanks a lot Harshi <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> I somehow din't perform in Felicity'08 as I was busy with other dances but I liked her dance alot <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Last but not the least, the morning jog <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> She is more regular than me when it comes to jogging. And I feel more happy if it is a day when both of us jog together <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And then comes the latest tournaments which we have together participated in. Throwball at Narayanamma, Badminton at ICFAI and what not!! She is one of the two girls from my batch, the other being Lydia who accompanied me in most of the activities at IIIT and I loved her company <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>One has to appreciate her dedication in following a strict diet, regular excercising and losing lots of weight within a very short period.. And now you can see her in smiles all the time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She has this habit of buying lots of new clothes and making others jealous <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Ya, I too buy lots of them, but she does it very often. Her lifestyle<br>changed quite a bit since her bro started staying at Hyd. You owe it all to your brother Harshi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>This might not end..<br><br>I wish you all the very best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and yeah. I'll be waiting for the wedding invitation harshi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Will Miss U <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  Lot of luv <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>She is the girl next door in the hostel and the girl next chair in the classroom <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sitting beside each other for four long years in most of<br>the courses, we have had many experiences both good and bad <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is a big fan of this "Tollywood" game which anyone who sits besides her<br>will have to get habituated to... She is full of energy all the time.. I have never seen her getting bored doing anything she is interested<br>in.. She is a big book of short stories of all kinds - humour, love, heroic and tragedy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is a die-hard fan of Federer... You won't believe she cried for one whole day when he lost to Nadal... And also a huge fan of football!!  She doesn't play many sports but yeah has a very good knowledge about many of them.<br><br>Her vocab is simply awesome!! Her blogs will speak about it all... Congratulations for getting into BOA =d< Good Luck!!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sushu... the chatter box <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> When it comes to explaining any situation or any incident that has already occurred, no one can do it better than her <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I bet you can't miss a bit of the story when Sushu is the narrator <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>She thinks completely differently... Her presumptions are of the kind that none of us even presume to be the consequence of some situation. I first wondered how she could think that way but had to agree when she said her mother reacts the same way she does!!! She is very studious... to that degree that she completes studying the subject taught in the class that day itself <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> I still remember how she and Ramya did their BTP in turns, one from 9 P.M to 3 A.M and the other from 3 A.M to 10 A.M. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <br><br>Congratulations for getting admits from your dream Universities =d< <br><br>She is the favorite student of Prof. Rawat <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Whatever the problem with the Networks course might be, she is the one whom Rawat calls first to solve it or help him with it <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Why don't you ask him if he knows somebody at TAMU and will help you in getting a TAship or RAship Sushu?? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I just saw the US Map yesterday. New York and Texas are quite far from each other Sushu <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I wish you all the very best for your future endeavours... We will anyway stay in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shalini.html>Shalini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I first met Shalda at NIT, Warangal during AIEEE counselling. "Calm and Innocent" was the very first impression she left on me. And then at IIIT, we were the two who were given the two corner most rooms in opposite wings in the 2nd floor while all our batch girls occupied those in the 3rd floor. And that is how we both started being together....<br><br>She moved to my opposite room few months ago..Since then, we started freaking out very often.. We both have some similar interests too. Liking for all the road-side masala food, watching all the tv shows and reality shows, etc.. Be it going to the paratha point or the pani puri or the chinese waala, we both will definitely be there in the gang <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Keeping aside all the fun, She is one big "KASI" at Studies. Good at programming and also very sincere in completing her work on time <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>And now we both are into the same company <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I wish I join along with you Shals <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But its ok.. It will become difficult for them to handle two great brains together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Just do some wonders there and let the company make some huge profits... All the very best Shals <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Luv u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and will miss all those walks, chinese waala visits and especially someone who walks straight into my room whenever my room door is open.. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Anups..that is how I call her.. Donno the reason, but I somehow like teasing/irritating this girl <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is simple, she is sweet and she is bubbly. I address her sometimes as Miss.Donald Duck, for her cheeks and smile remind me of the latter <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Whenever she talks, her voice hardly even reaches my room which is just diagonally opposite to hers'...after all she should make sure that no one is able to listen to all the gossip she and Divya create in her room <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Just Kidding Anu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> It always makes me feel that it is some unique trait of this girl which makes her so sweet and very friendly. I also love the way in which she responds to people. She puts in all the respect and politeness she can when talking to someone <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>You can always see this small blush on her face most of the times. And yeah not to forget, you can see this girl bending her head 90 degress down and just blushing and blushing not being able to utter a single word when somebody around her talks about someone so special to her <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I will always remember her father addressing me as "evare aaa dongapilla" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> when she told him that I brought my car to the college and that she too wants one... <br><br>This testimonial would be incomplete if I don't mention about Anu's poetic skills. Her poems are just aswesome... And she has been my inspiration too <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the very best Anu <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Here is a 2-liner for my poem teacher <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Inkentakaalam ee dagudumootalu<br>Aa GopalaKrishnuni munda nee aatalu? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Miss. Nautanki <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Deepti is the one who is pretty close to me right from the first year at IIIT. May it be joy or sorrow, we both were always there for each other when one knocks the door of the other.<br><br>I remember every single day since we first met, right from the State Ranker's Meet at Sri Chaitanya to the "Samvedana" initiative today. She remained the same.. None of the circumstances could change her determination and dedication which have been her prime qualities. All that changed is her very beautiful curly hair into a bulky bunch of maggie noodles <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> But yeah, she could carry it off really well...<br><br>As she said, we both are pretty much the same when it comes to few things and not much the same when it comes to few others...I remember those days when I took the side of Ross and she of chandler's and Joey's and how each of us claimed our choice to be the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>There were times when she used to tease me for taking hell lot of time to get dressed up when we are going out somewhere. But now, I take the privilege of adding her name next to mine <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And she has this trait of not responding so well to our friendly hugs and hand-shakes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I pity "The" Guy Deeps <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>The perfection with which she does things is just awesome!!! And her sincere efforts to take Samvedana to greater heights are highly appreciable <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>All the best Deeps.. Be the same and keep in touch. Donot change yourself as you the way you are is just wonderful.. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Will miss you a lot.. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;<br>PART II <br><br>We have done many other courses together like DWDM, WDKM and Industry and Society. Whatever course it might be, we always worked together on every course project... and we had lots of fun in the classes pulling other's legs <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and sometimes each other's too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Btw, Lyddu is always ready to tease and irritate shalini all the time for no reason <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All in all, Lyddu is simple and sweet. She is an epitome of cleanliness. She has this cute little smile on her face all the time. She always says, "I like seeing everyone around me bearing a simple smile on their face. I feel sad if someone among my friends looks unhappy" <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> One can learn a lot from her.<br><br>She is always there for me... I just move to her room along with my lappy whenever I feel lonely or get bored. She says "My room door is always open for you dear <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ".We both have spent some most memorable times together. She was the one who always encouraged me when it comes to pursuing MS. She always enacts how I would change after an year or two and that sounds too funny <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I can't call this just friendship for it has lots of trust and affection too <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Thankyou Lyddu for all the care and love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Can never forget the walks, all the night stays in your room and all the fun we had these four years.<br><br>Last but not the least, here are few strict instructions to be followed if you want to stay in the near viscinity of Lydia <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>a) Read all the instructions from the list pasted on her door before you enter her room.<br><br>b) Don't you dare to walk into her room with your chappal on <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br><br>c) Wash your hands and legs with dettol immediately even if you find some tiny dust particle on the tips <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>d) Never try to talk some non-sense and waste your time when she is around.<br><br>Tried to make it as short as possible. Will miss you loads Lyddu <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Will miss someone whom I can immediately go to when I have something to share <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Sorry if I hurt you anytime. I wish to see you soon in US. Will be waiting for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your MS and PHD too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Love you dear <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Do you know what one of my friends said to me when I keep telling him about Lydia and the special relationship we share?? He said, "You should have such a friend from your first year itself <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> " and that says it all about lyddu...<br><br>To start off with....<br><br>Sanskrit Course:<br><br>   We used to sit beside each other in the class, note down every single point discussed in the class and then make many plans to study it that day itself with a sincere wish of getting an 'A' <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>   Do you what happens if a lecturer sees a student even turning his/her head during the lecture?? According to Lyddu, the student's grade will stoop down 2-3 levels <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> I was literally shocked and also awestruck when she told this to me in Sanskrit class. But then you know we get habituated to her out-of-the-world theories <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Honors - I:<br><br>   Well, four of us girls actually decided to work under Prof.Vikram Pudi and as two of the four had plans to work together, me and Lyddu are all smiles to be each other's partner <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I am really happy we decided to work together Lyddu <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>   We both made plans to work from the very first day on which Sir assigned the project <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and used to bug him every now and then possible. It took us 2-3 months to decide on the topic <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and then as always we were asked to work on the same for our BTP too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>BTech Project:<br><br>   Here it is... All through the tough days we had coding for our project, she has been so patient in waking me up every 10-15mins <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I make this "5mins sleep request" often and then she starts saying "ok navs gnite <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> " (with all the pun intended). I then say, "I have set the alarm Lyddu. I will definitely wake up in few mins <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ".<br> <br>   She used to get pretty tensed before the VIVA. I, as her BTP partner, have always made my sincere effort to boost up confidence in her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We have somehow successfully completed our project and now are eagerly waiting for the grades to be out...<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
