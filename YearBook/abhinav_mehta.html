<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Golu aka Abhinav is a sweet guy whose smile can put a smile on one's face. I remember once that we both were together interacting with seniors in 1st week in IIIT. The seniors really liked him and gave him a treat in the end! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He's quite a sensitive guy and once got angry about something that happened in the canteen, i don't remember what but he looked really angry. But apart from that he's quite a calm person and loves to live life his way, not unnecessarily influenced by others!<br>It was great meeting you Golu. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Have sooo many memories of you from the first year. Himank and Karan have said it all. You were the one who everyone loved.<br>People loved you for many things. But then you decided to change. Why and how, I choose not to question. It must have been in your best interest, and must have taken some guts and gumption.<br><br>It was a pleasant surprise to see you dancing with us in Felicity '09, Mohit Chauhan nite. You were always welcome to join us, and it was nice when you did. <br><br>You seem to be very much into research. Good for you, and I must say good for everyone. May God Bless!<br><br><b>Fav. Memories:</b> Our first interactions with Prof. Sangal and Mitra in 1st year, your dance for Mr. Freshers' talent round.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Himank has spoken about how we miss the Golu of the old. I couldn't agree more with him.<br><br>In our first year, Golu was this cheerful, chirpy little chap who always had something about him which made you laugh. All the same, he was a very magnetic personality, something which showed when he reached the final round of Mr. Fresher 2005. We did the Aakash skit together, and his bubbly spirit brought the play alive. You should have seen him dance, it was super fun, it was like Lakshmipaty Balaji batting in Pakistan.. Everyone loved it! <br><br>Then came Jeevan Vidya towards the end of the first semester- a shivir which we did together. Right from day one, Golu seemed to be intrigued by what Ganeshji had to say. He kept asking a lot of questions, something which we found amusing as we'd thought that he was doing it for the fun of it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We enjoyed it and played along, by encouraging him to 'ask more doubts'. But nah, apparently the shivir truly affected him like nothing else did. I could see that when Aniket and I wrote the article on JV for the college mag - his interview was the most interesting. He spoke about how certain things affected him and brought about some kind of a change in him.<br><br>Now, Golu always smiles when he sees us, but hes not the same bubbly chap anymore. He is generally lost deep in his thoughts, and is probably more focused. <br><br>I long for those first year days. You might have changed from Golu to Mehta, but your memory with me will be that of Golu.<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Your dance during the practice sessions for Aakash.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is the simplest and the most genuine guy I have ever met. Always carrying a smile which will force you to greet him and smile even if you don't want to. I feel noone can ever be angry with him. A very sweet and soft spoken guy who is always ready to help you no matter who you are. Quite discplined and has somewhat different perspective towards life. I feel he is one of those few people who were influenced by Jeevan Vidya. I remember one incident during Felicity when some group was presenting a dance. As usual people were passing comments and shouting. He became so angry by this that started fighting with us. I appreciate his views but that really pissed off many of us and he should not try to force things on others.<br><br>You have always been a guy who cheered me up with your smile. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>God bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Keep smiling <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Abhinav Mehta aka Golu</u><br>Commonly known as Golu for his rotund shape back in first year, which he has lost to a great extent. He is one of the people of our batch who seem to have been lost into obscurity. One of the favourite of seniors during the interaction period and quite popular among the people of the batch. Everybody to this day remembers the typical <b>"golu type"</b> dance which he did on the stage. Winning a lot of admiration with his steps(?) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. First year or so, he was amongst the most active people of batch visible everywhere, talking to each and everyone.<br>I dunno what took over him and he became the shy and introvert person from a completely extrovert person that he was, though I think it must have been in his best interest to hav gone through such a turnaround. These days I don't  even remember when was the last time I saw him, partly due to my lazy nature. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future man.. Keep rocking... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>A piece of Advice</b> - Hope to see a laughing <b>Golu</b> the next time I see you.<br><br>Cheers!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>warmest guy of our batch.. he would always be the first one to say hi when you walk by.. love you man..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Undoubtedly the most humble guy i have ever met in IIIT. I came to know him through Pankaj. We used to speak a lot, delivered a very impressive performance during the informals in 2k5 also. One of those aliens <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> to convert from Btech to Dual degree. But i hope your passion for good research will help you in completing this degree in time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>We were in the same A3 batch of english and used to talk a lot during that period....  A very interesting guy he was very sharing during that period and told me abt someone in Chandigarh <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ...  Well I used to joke around with u on that subject but I seriously hope u meet her and tell her wat u feel...  He was very jovial <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and if he starts laughing it is very difficult for him to stop <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ....  Though our interaction nowadays is limited to only greetings as he has become a little serious but I will always remember that time in english class with u... <br>Best of luck for MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Simply putting a very cool dude .. always having a smile on his face. He is a serious researcher too .. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , always greets u with his beautiful smile .. I wish u all the best in ur MS and all future plans <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhinav is a down to earth and simple to understand person. Always meets you with a smile. His transition from very happy go lucky person to a serious researcher was almost sudden, at least for me. <br>A very good listener that is why a lot of people tell him a lot of things. This is the reason that he has a lot of gossip of others. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
