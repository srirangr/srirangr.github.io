<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>I fondly recollect all those Felicity incidents mate. Deciding on the core committee (a very difficult task); convincing people to work; deciding on designs; addressing various meetings; the fight over me not informing you stuff (you were right back then <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ); various meetings with the financial council and the way we used to bitch about them after the meeting <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (sorry finance waale); deciding on campaigning strategies; going to companies together, especially Progress software <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ; praying for the festival; The Indian Ocean fiasco and finally witnessing the best Felicity ever! And the fun moments... Leofying you with the names of various girls; gossiping about relationships  (we did that a looooooooot! <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ; bitching about people; talking absolute shit in the lab; leofying Sahiti.. Man I so very long for the Felicity moments to be back!<br><br>Apart from Felicity, I must mention that though he might repel you off at first, hes a very nice chap. Hes the first name who comes to mind when it is help for his friends. He put in selfless work for the placements too. He is also someone who'd speak out his heart, which was again very important for our working.  He hates it when we speak in Hindi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Come on man, you have to learn it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Besides, hes the laziest guy you'll ever find. His room, like mine, is always in a mess. And he had (has) a crush on a couple of girls from our college <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . <br><br>All in all, one person who I'm unlikely to ever forget. Get your MS quickly, and lets start an event management company <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .<br><br>You raaaacccccccck Mama! All the very best in life!<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Lucky from Main Hoon Na.<br>Fav memory: Post Felicity '08<br>Message for you: Try and speak in a better tone, so as to leave favourable first impressions. </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>For Harsha came as a whiff of fresh air for Felicity '08. He was a person who was determined to learn from previous years mistakes and see the fest grow. Initially, we had a lot of problems and issues.. As I mentioned, we are both very different people. Both of us had different ways of approaching the fest, different priorities, varied things which we wanted to see in Felicity '08 etc.. But over time and after a couple of skirmishes, we realized that both of us had similar aims- to see a bigger and better Felicity along the lines of our ideology. I remember the meeting we had in your room regarding putting aside our differences and working for the larger cause. We had one important ground rule- not to fight in the open. And I must mention, that both of us stuck to it except for that one day of the press conference outside 119. Even then, we promptly resolved the issue and got back to work <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Slowly, as the days passed by, the tension in our working relationship started changing into mutual respect for each others views. Later on, we became as united as one could be, and at the risk of sounding haughty, I'd say that it was one of the crucial factors for what we could achieve. Let me mention here that though hes a lazy person by his natural instincts, he really worked <i>very</i> hard during Felicity. And I mean it. He tried his best to contribute wherever he could. Testimony to that is the sponsorships field, where inspite of his limitations, he got us some of the best deals. Hats off to him for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . It was a good thing that he knew most of the people in the batch, and assigning responsibilities and pushing people became easier. Must mention here that he is a natural leader, people tend to respect him a lot once they know him.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>While filling the (un)necessary details for the yearbook, I came across the memorabilia question. Without any hesitation, my fingers typed in Felicity '08. Now, when I think about it, its amazing that two guys as different as chalk and cheese were at the helm of it, trying to give the fest a direction. That is how passion for a cause can drive things!<br><br>The story of Harsha and me has largely been the story of a dimension of Felicity altogether. Let me start from the bits and pieces before that. It was the first day of classes, and he came up and asked me to do something. I was like, "Wtf", and then he told me that he was a senior <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Like an obedient dog, I did what was asked of me. He saw three girls of our batch walking in the front (I wont name them <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) and asked me who I liked! On the informals day, he got me introed to some pretty girls from the 2k4 batch (wow!) and made me do some silly little errands, which I enjoyed. By this time, I had started talking regularly to him, till that day when I confessed to Jaws. Sorry for that incident mate, I realise that I should have spoken to you before trying to save my ass.  <br><br>The next time, I remember interacting him when we were giving the Freshers party to our juniors. While organizing the event, someone told me that Harsha will be a good guy for the hardware stuff. Thats when I approached him for the same, and I must mention- he was pretty good at it. The event passed off smoothly, and we developed a working relationship. <br><br>Fast forward to Felicity '08. It was the issue of selection of coordinators. Some nominations came in, and all of us who'd sent the same decided to meet and decide. At that point, it was Harsha who I turned to to mediate when a couple of us had issues. Back then, we finally decided to have Harsha as a coordinator, and I must say its been one of the most important decisions ever.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
