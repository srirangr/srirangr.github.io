<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part4:<br>There are a few more things to Kiran's character that I would like to add. <br>He's like 'George' in 'Curious George'. He like to pry into others' computers. I remember this incident that took place in the 1st year. One day i came to his room and he told me that he had installed a keylogger in Rishi's computer and that he could log in to yahoo! messenger from Rishi's account. Rishi came to know about what he had done and got very angry. The very night Rishi apparently came after Kiran with a stump in his hand, but thanks to the efforts of Kiran's floor mates that he was saved. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part2: <br>Kapil is an avid programmer and amongst the best in our batch. Apart from programming he also takes keen interest in watching STUFF.<br><br>Back to the past:<br>He and I interacted very little during the first three semesters. Even though he used to come to my room often, since he was a friend of my room partner's, but we talked very little. It was only during the 3rd year when we started to interact.<br><br>B.Tech Project:<br>As a BTP partner i wanted someone who was not only intelligent but also hard working. A few names struck my mind, out of which Kapil fitted the requirements properly. I asked him if he was interested to do the project, to which he readily agreed. <br>Result: We got an A. Thanks Kapil. It was a right decision to have you as my BTP Partner. <br>As our BTP progressed, so did our interaction and from being just 'batchmates' we became friends. <br><br>Kapil, you are a very hardworking person and i can foresee a bright future for you. Best of luck. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part1:<br>I think this is the right time to write Kapil a testimonial, since we have got an A now. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I know Kapil since the first year of college. We were floormates, then we became BTP Partners and finally we became FRIENDS. Kapil has always been a very hardworking guy and it's because of that he is where he is now - Amazon. <br>On a panic scale of 10, i would give him a 7 for his consistent performance ( consistently panicking ). Be it exams, assignments, lab tests, placement preparations ... he's always panicking and i guess people will not disagree. <br>Apart from being good at studies he is also good at sports ( read basketball ) and has represented his house and our college in innumerable competitions. <br><br><i have a class now, i will continue later></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 3:<br>He is fond of watching movies that have a "good story". Huh! Not once has he suggested me a good movie. Once I asked him to suggest a good horror film "jise dekh kar darr lage" and he recommended "The Orphanage" <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . If the movies that I like form set A and the movies he likes form set B, then the union of set A and B will be a universal set and the intersection would be null. Huff!<br><br>Having said all these things about Kiran, I would like to add a few more things before concluding. He is very sharp (he studies just a few hours before any exam and yet scores more marks than me), he is ingenuous (people like him are hard to find now a days), he can crack PJs and that too iPJs (complex ones <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). <br>Kiran it has been good to know you and have you as a friend and I know we will remain friends for life because you do not have anger issues neither are you short tempered. I wish you all the best for your future.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2:<br>General Traits:<br>He is a geek of sorts. He loves to keep himself updated with the latest technology products that come into the market. He knows which linux destro offers what. There was a time when he would install an OS almost every second day. And this did not go for a week for two, but for almost a year. ( Kiran, do you disagree? ). Despite of him being a geek, he prefers Windows over Linux. Amazing! <br>He is also and avid gamer and also loves to read about them. I am sure he has played more games than anyone else in IIIT. <br>The letters c and s find a special place in his heart, because they combine to form "cs" which stands for coffee shop and also for counter strike. He is ready for both any time of the day (except when he is sleeping). <br>He sleeps a lot and that too at odd hours. <br><br>Not so general traits:<br>He loves good food and especially non-veg food. He is always ready to go out for dinner, except when he is running low on cash. <br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1:<br><br>I know Kiran since the first year of college, but we became friends only after the second semester. If I correctly remember I first interacted with him during one of our practice sessions for the freshers day. <br>( He played a PTI and that too a very funny one ). <br><br>Shot to fame:<br>Kiran shot to fame in the second semester, when he asked Prof. Govidrajulu if he wanted "PROOF". Until then I had no inkling that he had so much guts. (It requires guts to ask a Professor of that stature such a question and that too in front of a class of more than a 100 students. Does it not?).After that incident,"Do you want proof?" became his second name. <br><br>Change in 4 years:<br>Kiran has changed little in these 4 years in college. <br>1)He was a geek then, he is a geek now. <br>2)He was a foodie then, he is a foodie now. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>17271)He did not attend classes then, he does not attend classes now. <br> and the list still continues...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I wrote the testimonial of my own free will. PERIOD</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>After continuous nagging for days, here comes a testimonial for Abhishek. <br>I don't remember how we first met or when we first talked, all i know is that we lived in the same hostel. People have been calling him 'Scientist' since first year of college. As a matter of fact, the first time i heard this name 'Scientist', i thought that he must be some kind of self boasting, arrogant bastard, but as we can all see, it turned out the opposite. Champ ( as i fondly call him ) is a very cute, funny and 'Interesting' person. Even though he is very lazy, stubborn and a typical sindi, but you just can't hate him. Even though he is a dual degree student, but he hardly works on his research project and I can still remember how long did he take to decide what he wanted to do for his MS Project. He is full of weird, yet creative, ideas and was also working with dandu on a story, but it soon lost steam, but be it now or later  he'll definitely come up with something. One thing that should be said about Champ is that he never falls short of ways of wasting time. He has been doing it since first year and I know he'll continue to do it in the future as well. There's another thing about him that should find a mention here - he has taken some very difficult courses in these 4 years and has also secured good grades in them     (something very commendable for a lazy person like him). Even though he is very lethargic, but when he's working he puts in all his effort (again, something not many people can do). THE END<br>Dude, are you happy now? Please prepare a draft if you didn't like this testimonial. I'll just paste that. <br>I forgot, he watches some 272 odd TV-Series ( THE FIGURE IS NOT EXAGGERATED ). No wonder why he doesn't find time to work on his project and attend classes. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It's difficult to write anything about Gaurav in 3 mins. Nevertheless, I'll give it a shot. He's one of the most hardworking people i've seen. He is also very sincere and at times very funny too. He's moody and I'm sure everyone in the 'world' knows that. You can never predict when you might be at the receiving end and to tell you the truth  it has happened with me quite a few times too. He is sometimes very rude and also doesn't generally help others. But, he's a good guy ( I know people will agree with that ) and it is because of that we are friends and remain to be so for ever. I wish him all the best for his future endeavours and hope he gets married and have kids soon. <br>Arrivederci <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
