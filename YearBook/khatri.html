Pair ghisat ghisat ke chalta hua din mein 10 bar mere room ke saamne se nikal ke washroom mein ja ke mooh dhota hai. Din bhar wing mein BC. Kabhi kabhi katwaane ke baad bhi khud ko khush rakhna, bandion ke saamne thoda conscious ho ke impression marne ki koshish karna, exams ke pehle sab padh lena aur phir kehna ki nahi padha, ek hi gaane ko loop mein chala ke full volume pe kar room lock kar ke chale jaana... ye sab kaee khattee meethi baatein hain jo hamesha yaad rahengi. Koi shikayat nahi hai, aise bahut se kaam maine bhi kiye honge. Humne apni life ke chaar best saal ek doosre ke saath aise hi nikaale hain. I'll miss all of it. Always.<br><br>Ab aur kya bataoon, Yearbook ki deadline khatam hone aa gayi hai, pata nahi ye testimonial post bhi ho paaye ya nahi. IIIT ka time khatam ho gaya dost. Apne beech mein common baatein bahut kam hain, ya kahein ki hain hi nahi. Have quite different aims and ambitions in life. Isiliye mujhe lagta hai ki shayad hum log bahut zyada time tak ek saath na rahein. God knows. Phir bhi I can never forget you and the years we spent together, and whatever I become, you will always have a contribution to it. You will always remain my friend. May God always bless you in whatever you do. <br><br><b>Ten years down the line I see you as:</b> An awesome wala Marketing Manager in a bigshot company, with an amazingly sexy wife.<br><b>Memories:</b> Too many to write here.<br><b>Tags:</b> Wing, group, BTP, kaands, BTech.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Khatri<br><br>2nd sem mein dosti hui thi... Narang ka Dilli connection, aur tab se aaj tak har cheez mein ek hi saath rahe hain... Ek saath rooms liye 2nd, third aur fourth years mein, ek saath Disco, scuffle, daru kaand mein fasey, ek saath BTP kiya, ek saath courses le ke ek saath exams mein padhe, ek saath placements ke liye padhe aur ultimately ek ke baad ek interviews de ke, interviews mein ek doosre ko mention karte huye, ek hi company mein naukri paayi. Jitna saath main aur Khatri rahe hain BTech mein, utna shayad hi aur koi raha ho hamaare batch mein. Saath ke incidence isiliye main gina hi nahi raha. Itna padhne pe khud hi isko yaad aa jayega. Bhoolega thodi. Hamaare jitne kaand IIIT mein aaj tak shayad hi kisi ne kiye hon. <br><br>Banda zabardast witty hai. Aur har cheez mein kaam nikalwana jaanta hai. Kuchh bhi jugaad laga keta hai bakchodi kar kar ke. Iski wit ka bahut fayda mila hai. Itne saare rooms ek wing mein kabhi na milte. Kaheen bhi jaana ho, gaadi ka jugaad kar deta hai. BTP mein Venky ka kaatne mein bhi iski BC karne ki kala bahut kaam aayi. Awesome kirrak time nikla hai yaar saath mein. <br><br>A total Bollywood fan. Bollywood ki saari cheezein pata rehti hain isey, kaun si movie mein kisne kya kiya, kis scene min kya hua, sab kuchh. Hindi movies ka bahut bhayankar fan hai. Isiliye main English mein iska testimonial nahi likh raha. <br><br>Banda hamesha awesome cool rehta hai, par jab iski fat jaati hai, to mujhe pata chal hi jaata hai kitna bhi chhupaane ki ye koshish kar le. Hum dono ne ek doosre ki bahut gandi se gandi fataaye mein dekha hai. Aur actually hamaari kaafi time kisi na kisi baat ko le ke thodi bahut to fataaye mein rahi hai. Aajkal bhi hai. Offer letter aa hi nahi raha company se. <br><br>Iski chhoti chhoti baatein meri life ka aisa hissa ban chuki hain ki main bata nahi sakta. Pair ghisat ghisat ke chalta hua din mein 10 bar mere room ke saamne se nikal ke washroom mein ja ke mooh dhota hai. Din bhar wing mein BC.

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Khatri aka "Khattu" aka "G for" aka "Sikandar" aka "Gladiator"<br><br>Kitna bada bcbaaz hai ye. Isse bada bcbaaz nahi dekha hoga. Jab logon ki maarne par aata hai to maarta jaata hai, chup hi nahi karta. But the good thing is, jab Khatri maarta hai to saamne vala bhi enjoy karta hai. Hamare resumes almost same hain. Dono ne hi second year mein Pramati mein intern ki thi. Dono ne hi third year mein MS mein intern ki thi. Before intern in Pramati, I never talked to him. Mujhe ye typical Delhite lagta tha. But intern ke time iske baare mein pata chala. This guy is amazing. Hum dono milkar Jitu ki khoob lete the us time. Uske baad fir humne saath gym jana shuru kiya 4-2 mein aur iski vajah se mere kuch aur achche friends ban gaye hain like Devi, Prabudh, Mohak and Poonia. Thanks for that buddy. Going to gym in 4-2 along with you guys will definitely remain in my cherishable memories of my college life. Volleyball ka naam yaad aate hi tera naam zaroor yaad aayega ki ek Khatri tha hamare batch mein jo kuch bhi kar le, kuch bhi strong se strong team lele, lekin uski team hamesha haarti thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. FIFA'07 ko bhi kabhi nahi bhoolunga, kitna pela hai tujhe usmein <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. aur badminton ka vo game, jismein apan dono ne first time singles' match khela tha aur tu haara tha. Us din Devi ne kuch jyada hi chadha diya tha tujhe <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bahut saari memories associate ho gayi hain yaar tere saath last semester mein. Keep rocking dude. Gurgaon jakar khoob bandiya ghumaiyo aur humein bhool mat jaiyo. Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All the best for all your future endeavours <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. CAT dekar fir se batchmates bante hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish aka novirus</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Khatri is one of my earliest friends in IIIT. In first sem we used to do a lot of BC in his room. In fact I used to stay in his room all day and night and use my room only for the necessities like sleeping. It was a great time we had that sem.<br>But, the best memory isn't the one back then .. In second sem I somehow separated from the group and found some other friends. But Then came the summer after 3rd sem. Madu, Pappu, Pado and khatri were there in MS and that was a period of a lifetime we spent together. This guy, I must say, is a laugh riot when he starts talking. You can leave him in a city alone without any money .. and he will come back just by the power of his mouth. A big-Big-BIG fan of hindi movies. Has many of shahrukh 'stuff' stored in his lappy. The physique does not tell a correct story about him .. he looks like a monster .. but is a nice guy who can watch sarkar-raj 3 times just for a girl <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Bangalore wouldn't have been that awesome without him .. buddy .. I still miss the bangalore time ..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Song for you: Golmal hai bhai sab golmal hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Message for you: Keep talking<br>Best Memory: Do I need to mention ...

I have	<br>been told that he saw the movie <b>Mera Pehla Pehla Pyar</b>, everyday for about a month <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>Always enjoyed the interactions I had with you, keep going on in the same vein <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Couldnt stop myself from posting this, but the anagram of his name is <b>Tharki</b> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Undoubtedly one of the biggest BCbaaz in the entire batch, G Khatri is one of those people which I'll remember for a long time. In the first year I had this impression that he must be some gangster and he must have been to quite some number of times before coming to college <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He used to leofy people right from the first year and its going on till date. Quite huge and thats why his first impression might be quite fearful <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>I remember during the first years, his and our gangs had some differences and that's why there was no interaction at all except some fights. Once he passed some comments on someone from TB during some class and that day I saw Chand angry for the first time. It was very frightening and actually Khatri ki phat li thi. From that day onwards he never passed any comment or did anything against TB.<br><br>Be it his size or anger or his leofying nature, he had been treated as Gaurav Jain of our batch and juniors were afraid of him during our second year. He was among those few people who "ragged" the juniors. He hold a great repo among the seniors too. I believe he was never into studies and one could always find him leofying people here and there, his favourite victims being Raman and Mathur. You just ist with him and you'll be forced to laugh your heart out. His one liners are just toooo awesome and its always fun to have him around.<br><br>A football freak and a decent cricket player. These days he is obsessed with gyming and one should see his commitment towards that. Badminton in the moring and evening and rigorous gyming in the evening. Volleyball after that. Looking at him you can never imagine he can do all that.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>One of the most shocking moment of my college life would be his internship in MS. When the news came out that he got an intership in MS, half of the college was literally dead by the shock of this news. I don't think even he himself ever dreamed of it. But whatever it is,  he proved his mettle and he actually did his internship there <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. The same goes for his placement. Frankly speaking, I never imagined he would be placed so early but he did and hats off to him for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>His true nature came out in the third year or so and then I realised that he is not at all like what he looks like. Theres much more to him and I'll cherish so many of the bc sessions where he was present. Raman's usualy dialogue describing him is "Yaar man to mera bhi hota hai uski maarne ka lekin saala itna bada bakchod hai ki ek saath 4-5 sentences bol deta hai aur mujhe kuch bolne ka time hi nahin milta" <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><br>He shares some wierd relationship with Pappu and one should see them when they are together (not to mention the junior booze treat when he bargained for him in exchange of a vodka <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ). They share some strange chemistry which is out of this world <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <br><br>All in all it has been a fun ride with him from a daraawanaa character to a lively, always laughing chap.<br><br>Hope you'll great in future. Good luck and God bless you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>Khatri is also an active guy in college affairs, and the work he put in for Felicity '08 was commendable. In fact, the OSO idea and its final stage execution were brilliant. Handling so many people at once was not easy, and he pulled it off brilliantly. However, I must mention here that I was disappointed at the way he handled certain situations during the event. He asked me if I wanted to be a part of the dance, and I said yes. But for some reason, he kicked me out <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But hell, ultimately he put in a lot of good work, and thats what is important. Cheers for that mate!<br><br>Other memories with him include the IPL auction and the tournament <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , hanging out together in first year, Ooty trip, Gudbud, Charm++, doing the harman baweja dance together <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Some of those memories have been amazing, and I really hope that we can stay friends for a long time. <br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b> Person he resembles: Sikander Kher <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: The 7 over bowling spell we put in together against PG.<br>Message for you: CAT ke liye padh lena <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>In some ways, Khatri must be the most misunderstood guy around. "Khatarnak Khatri", rofl at that. He is definitely not 'khatarnak', what with those mushy Shah rukh Khan movies and stuff. I have <i>never</i> seen a more die-hard fan of SRK than him. I mean, in Bangalore, he'd revise KKHH after every few days <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> In fact, hes crazy about Bollywood, and made sure that we watched atleast one movie every weekend in Bangalore. It was one helluva' time we had over there! Movies, dining out, weekend trips, foosball.. We had an absolute ball! And his sense of humour.. It made the stay a lot more fun. The way he'd leofy Pagare was awesome! In fact, you've got to see him BC-ing when hes in the flow. There is not a person on this earth who he cannot leofy! And entertainment is guaranteed when hes at it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His BC-baazi goes beyond that, and he is a known master at convincing people and making them follow his point of view. A perfect quality for a manager, I am sure he'll be a good man for such roles.<br><br>I have other memories with Khatri, the most prominent among them being the DISCO in 2006. It was a nightmarish experience, but something which we look back and smile at today. Somehow we've been co-troublemakers, with both of us being involved in the scuffle and daroo case as well! Apart from these, Khatri was my wing mate in the first year, and among my first friends. I remember the BC we had in the first year, along with Saurabh, Saket and Piyush <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Khatri has <br>also been a constant in the batch and house cricket teams, and its been a pleasure bowling with him. These days, Khatri is quite dedicated towards his fitness, and gives 4-5 hours to his body everyday. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> You got to look at the way he tries to dominate any game he plays <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
