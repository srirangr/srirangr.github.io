<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vivekanand ... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... <br><br>Really a hard working and techy and helping guy ... jab dekho smile deta rehta hai... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... <br><br>Wish u a bright future ahead.... keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... Keep smiling <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the first people I met and talked to, in IIIT-H. His computer science knowledge and skills are very impressive. He was one of the few people, apart from me, who had some prior computer science and programming knowledge and we<br>used to discuss what we'd learnt in school!<br>We talked about movies, songs etc. I still remember the evening of freshers'05 when Vivek, Atul, Srirang and I were singing 'Dus Bahaane' song a little away from the stage and others were staring at us. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bicky baikoob (the way I fondly address him), is, as all other testimonials of his suggest, a mean green technical machine. Genius personified!!! <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>I always believed there were two kinds of students in this world - one who go to the core to understand a concept at its roots, and one who are produce the brilliant results, fast and furious. And then I met the third kind - bicky the great, he goes to the root of any concept, makes sure he doesn't stay there, comes back and produces wonderful results. A perfect blend of a researcher as well as a developer. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>While most people know about his intellectual strengths, few, almost none here in IIIT-H know the person he is. Easily, one of the most misinterpreted people in college, he is very innocent and extremely sensitive. It's sad to see people who don't even know him, conclude about his intentions. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Koi na bicky, hum hain na tere saath <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>With all the brain power, he is still a little kid with the kind of energy and enthusiasm you would find in a 10 year old. Few people know that he is quite agile and a fighter in every kind of sport.<br><br>And equally enthusiastic about doing some creative stuff like play writing, singing, playing guitar, etc. He is one person who gives everything his best shot without worrying about what people think about in case he is not good. <br><br>And that is the reason why he has pulled a rabbit out of his hat in every field he has tried. A true winner and all rounder  <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>You'll succeed in every sphere of life champ <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We are there for you always <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Just one word <br>"Bond"<br>It defines him better then any testimonial I could write.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vivek prakash bhai..kabhi bhi gali mein dikhe .. hi sabse pahle karta hai ... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Banda ..padhai mein bond hai...baaki to logo ko pata hi hai kaisa hai..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Bhai MS ko bacha ke rakhna .. aisi hi mehnat karna .. and hope ki life mein aage badhe ...banda sahi hai...bas thoda sudhaar aur chahiye <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vivek Prakash, one of the most intelligent guys in the batch. I remember how he used to tell us that he knew JAVA, C#, Pearl, Python and what not back in the first year itself. Even when it came to the programming assignments, he'd be the first one to get done with them. He is quite hard working too when it comes to his acads; little wonder that he has a job in Microsoft.<br><br>A certain incident made him infamous though <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the best!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vivek bhai ...<br><br>I met this guy during our freshers. He's a very enthusiastic guy. Active in everything. He used to sing, dance and even he was in skit (you remember "Kabhi aar kabhi paar" sequence <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Well, those were first year days. Later on he never participated in anything for the house.<br><br>When we were in GHEB, we were quite close we used to visit each others rooms quite frequently for Singing, Keyboard practice and what not. A very soft spoken guy who always has a plan for everyday and is always ready with the assignments and stuff 2-3 days before the deadline. But sala, never helped any of the guys <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. In some ways he's quite similar to me. I know many natural languages and he knows many programming languages <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We are both chubby <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>The most unforgettable moment with you would be doing "Kajra Re.." and "Kabhi aar.. kabhi paar.." on the stage. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. A complete ROFL performance of my life.<br><br>He's a very hardworking and intelligent guy and hence deserves to be in M$ <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. All the best for your future plans and keep rocking.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>vivek - talented n 'padhaku' ....<br>i remember in first year ... this guy was already familiar with C language n all ... n he used to help us all in doing our 'jawahar' sir assignments ... used to explain concepts with great clarity ...<br>aur jab bhi koi program bolte the likhne ko class mein ... this guy was d only one who used to raise his hands .... aur iski typing skills bhi awesome thi ...<br>bahut padta hain aur bahut knowledge bhi hain ... iska skill set in Resume was mind-blowing !!!<br>isne kafi koshish apna academic talent use karke koi achi friend(gal) banane ki ... par har koshish nakam ho gayi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>koi nahi dude ...

<b><a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>hmm...vivek..the geek of our batch <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ..he has an excellent IQ..is very very close to me...and has been wid me during all my tough times....never says no if asked for any help..cracks silly jokes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />..his innocence lands him into problems.... few ppl misunderstand him..but he is really really nice..the ultimate TA...explains very well..professors' pet...I still remember the time in 2nd year when he was sick wid jaundice..i taught him for the midsems(which happened only once <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)and he scored more than me in every subject <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ...huh!..i lost count of the number of languages(programming <img src=Smileys/3.gif />) he knows..all in all a gr8 guy...with awesome coding skills..all i wanna say is I ll miss u a lot bhai <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and i hope this frndship lasts forever</b></i></ul><br><br>
