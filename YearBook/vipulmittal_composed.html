<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Finally a testimonial for my best mate, my first ever best friend and a person who had always hold a special place in my life. Himank aka Bhalu is among those very very few people whom I interacted with in the first year. Actually it won't be an exxageration if I say my whole world was confined to 2-3 people and he definitely topped that list. I never had a good friend before coming to college and I actually find one in him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>I met him on the very first day in cellar and he was quite unique in his behaviour. Hair all messed up, dressed in his legendary yellow shirt, biting nails and talking n some more talking. As many people have noticed, my first impression was also of a jackass who looked quite irritating. Then I came to knew that he was in my English group and it was there that a new relationship took birth which later became so strong that both of us would have never imagined. Due to the same group, we had the same tutorials and lab sessions. We used to go together to the class, tutes and English class. He was very lazy and careless so he always wanted me to take care of his notebooks and carry them if he forgets any of them. I was his pseudo PC partner in the workspace. Back then, I had shared so many things with him that I have never done in my life before that.<br><br>Those daily walks around the campus and on the Microsoft road will definitely be among my most memorable moments in the college life. We used to talk about ourselves for hours and it was always fun to do that. He was the first person who helped me get my feelings out. I was very shy and introvert back then. He always pestered me to speak up to people and whatever change people notice in my behaviour these days, its all because of him. I owe him very much <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He totally changed me for my own good and has been my constant support. He gave me the name "Pagal Kutta" and that's because I used to "speak so much".<br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Come second year and he converted to CSE from ECE and used to sit next to me in lectures. He was never into studies and never let others to study. Constantly talking, irritating by doing somethings or playing on his mobile during the lectures. There have been a number of times when he told me some of his secrets and two of them are very special because both the times I was the first one to know about them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of them is now known by many of us but another one is still lying deep inside his heart and I hope your dream gets fulfilled <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Thanx a lot for putting so much faith in me and telling me that because it makes you feel very special when someone does like that.<br><br>There have been bad times in our friendship but they never lasted for a long time. I remember an incident when I was upset with something and I wrote a mail instead of telling him. He replied with a mail and it was very touching. He also told me that the first poem he wrote on his blog was dedicated to me. I was overwhelmed by this and can never forget that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He has been with me everytime for the first two years and when we shifted to OBH, he again became my neighbour. Here he became much more irritating and he along with Chand have irritated me so much that I actually decided to change the wing once. I would have never wanted it with him but things started degrading and somehow differences started to creep in between our relationship. I don't know if he has realised this or not but our bond is not the same as it was in the first two years. I get irritated very much and sometimes I cannot even bear a sight of him. He pisses me off more often than ever before. We do not talk much, do not share things. I seriously hope things get back to normal between us because he is one guy who I never want to lose. <br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>On a lighter note, he is a damn good blogger and until some time back, his posts were always fun to read and one of the favourite pastime. But now he writes some shit and I do not read. But he pesters people to just leave a comment on the blog even if you don't want to read the complete post. Multitasking like girls and has more girl friends than boys. Everytime you go to his room, he'll be reading some article, chatting with 3-4 girls, playing solitaire, twittering and smoking. During all this, a video or movie is being played in the background.<br><br>The thing that defines him other than BC and blog is daroo. He is a tank when it comes to drinking and you can pour as many alcohol as you want. Until recently I have never seen him out after drinking. But these days sala har baar out ho jata hai. He is the chairman of the elite bewada group <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. As far as I remember, there has been no booze session where he was not present except one and that too because he was not in the town <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He was the one who introduced me to drinking and smoking, though I quit smoking some time back. You can always find him irritating people all around the campus. He never discriminates between girls and boys when it comes to irritating and his all time favourite victim being Prashasti. He has not left a bit of his nails, even then he keeps on biting them. Janaab sutta aise maarte hain jaise kisi ne zabardasti muh mein thoos diya ho. bhai agar itna hi bura lagta hai to mat piya kar <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 4</b><br><br>I always wanted some people to stay in Hyderabad after the college and he was always in that list. I'm happy that he didn't make it to IIM <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and he is placed in Hyd. Just want to tell you that you have always hold a very special place in my life and due to some reasons which I don't know, things have changed. I'm really sorry if I have ever hurt you and I forgive you for all that irritation you caused. I hope things will get back to normal.<br><br><b>Most memorable moments</b> include MS party, those innumerable walks during the first years, English classes. Its been one hell of a  ride with this chap with so many ups and downs and I'll cherish soooooo many of the moments spent with him. We'll always stay in touch. Thanx a lot for everything <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May God bless you with all the happiness and you get the girl of your dream soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Good luck for that and keep trying for the same <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Now this might come as a surprise but it would have been unfair it I wouldn't write a testimonial for my only dance partner from the batch. I never talked to her before Felicity inaugral dance practice where she was my partner. Our interaction was not that much but by whatever it was I could easily make out that she is very soft spoken, kind and a very sensible girl. She is quite decent and that is one quality which I like the most.<br><br>I used to hear a lot about her in the first years from so many of my friends that there is this girl who is tooo good in English that baki sabki grades ki waat laga di hai. She is reasonably good at academics. I have not seen her playing any games so cannot comment on that. But when it comes to dancing, no one can beat her and she is undoubtedly the best dancer in our batch. The beauty about her dance is that she looks very comfortable in whatever style she dances be it classical, folk, salsa or western. I feel its her greatest strength.<br><br>That's it from me now. Just want to wish you loads of luck and my best wishes. Keep dancing wherever you go <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>I always knew him as a kiddish, innocent and a friendly guy. We share a special bond and I always leofy him but he never minds it. The greatest quality about him would be his patience level. People keep on leofying him and he never retaliates. He always take it in good spirit and just laughs and keeps on laughing.<br><br>I met him for the first time in workspace when he  was watching "something" on his pc <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> My first impression was of a geek. He used to stay in GHEB and that's why the interaction level was very less. We used to meet only during outings. When he shifted to NBH, I came to know a lot about him. He is definitely a geek but there is lot more to his character which makes him so special and different from others. He is very pure at heart and hardly keeps any hard feelings for others. He always do some idiotic and stupid things which will force you to lugh your heart out. I remember we became very good friends during his stay in NBH.<br><br>I remember one incident when I visited his room in GHEB once and just as he opned the door, I could not even stand there for a second. It was stinking like hell and I was really amazed that how can this guy stay in such a room <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. When he shifetd to NBH, my biggest concern was that now cellar will also start stinking. But this never happened <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I remember that Himank used to exploit him so much at that time and I always felt pity for him. Poor chap <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. If someone else would have been in his place, he would have kicked Himank's ass but Maruti never complained about him. A real linux geek. He has helped me uncountable times with linux problems. <br><br>Contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Then things started changing during the third year when he got busy with CVIT work. This drifted him apart from the group and I feel that was the biggest loss for the group so far <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Then when we shifetd to OBH, he was left alone on the 3rd floor and this made the things more worse. I'm so grateful that I've always been on talking terms with him. Recently he again started staying with us and its so good to see that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. It's so much fun when he is around. He always cracks some silly jokes or gives some gestures which make everyone laugh. I feel its really great that he has again become a part of the group.<br><br>Academically he has worked very hard from 3rd year onwards. This can be justified by his internship in Google. It was sad that he couldn't make it for the PPO but he finally made it to Yahoo during placements. Hats off 2 u mate <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>I'll cherish so many of the moments spent with you. Your silly questions, your blank face, your laugh, your childish behaviour, your innocence, your dedication. I'll remember so many things about you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I felt that you are very easily influenced by people. So just ensure that you are not very much influenced by others <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> otherwise you are very good and try to be the same for ever <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br><b>Most memorable moment</b> would be last booze session in my room, that long chat walking in the campus and those infinite bc sessions we had in your room in NBH and my OBH wing. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>God bless you. Good luck for your future bro <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sambhav bhai ke baare mein itna kuch hai bolne ke liye lekin bas words nahin mil rahe. For our batch he is like a cherry on the cake. He is the most versatile character I have seen. Be it acads, cultural, managemnet or organization, he has excelled himself in every field. For the faculty, he is among their most favourite students and he must be at the top in Sangal Sir's list <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He has been my neighbour for the first two years in cellar and we always used to talk whenever time permitted. He taught us Graphics and whatever marks I got, its all because of him. Thanx a lot for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Culturally he is just brilliant. When it comes to knowledge about hindi songs, no one can beat him. He has won many of the Antakshari events held here and organised many. A damn good singer and very hard working. Holds wonderful repo among the seniors and juniors. Within the batch itself, he holds a very special place. <br><br>I have done some courses with him and he just knows what to do to keep the faculty impressed <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He possesses very nice presentation skills and always finds a way to keep everyone engaged. A fun loving guy who is always there to make you smile. Very friendly and a cool gentleman. How can one forget the hard work he has put up for the placements though he was not placed initially. Knows how to talk to people and easily mingles with whatever group he is in.<br><br>I still wonders how did he screw his GRE because he worked very hard for that and I still believe that he'll make it big soon. I hope for the same <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Its been a nice journey with you mate and I can never forget you. Good luck for your future. Giod bless you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mera Ajmeri bhai, Rishi has been a very good friend of mine. Bhai hamesha AC se travel karte the aur hum hamesha sleeper se. Garmi mein itna gussa aata tha ki use train se bahar phek ke uski jagah chala jaun <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But I used to go to his compartment and stay there for a long time.<br><br>Has been a very good cricket player and maintained a decent CG. His work for the finance council during the Felicity was exemplary. Very hard working and friendly to its core. Being parts of two different groups we have not talked much during the 4 years but it hardly matters because I know we are very good friends and he'll always be there whenever I'll need him.<br><br>I just hope you make it something big in near future. Good luck. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Pankaj is by far the most talented person in the college. When he performs an act, you are forced to leave whatever you are doing and just sit and watch him. Its always been a splendid performance whenevr he has performed. He is among those few guyz who were influenced by Jeevan Vidya and I feel he has defined his priorities well.<br><br>It was his sheer talent due to which he made it to the finals of Mr. Felicity but lost due to some reason <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. It seems that his priorities have always kept him away from the many of us. But its good to see that he is happy with what he is doing and that is what matters the most. He always greets you whenever you pass him and bears a smile for most of the time.<br><br>Good luck for your MS. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>By far the most sophisticated and genuine guy I have ever met, PSS is someone who has so many things to be learnt from. He is very soft spoken. His socialising skills are too good and this is why he is among those very few guyz who are at very good terms with most of the batch.<br><br>He worked day and night for the Literary Dept. of Felicity and made it a grand success. Hats of you you <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Now he is working very hard for Samvedana and taking it to new heights. He made a software and planned for a startup. He's currently working on the backend and I hope he'll get something great in that front <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Good luck for your startup. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ninja is one guy who has always been good to me. We used to meet in Yuktahaar during the meals and it was there that I came to know more about him. He is very soft spoken, helpful and very kind. He sticks to his ethics and its hard to make him do something whihc goes against them. I remember when people used to not pay in the mess or canteen, he always insisted on paying the appropriate amount. He used to give counter arguments and noone could argue him because everyone knew deep inside that he was right. I must admit that earlier I have also had my food in canteen without paying but this does not happen anymore and he is quite rsponsible for that. thanx a lot for making me realise my mistake.<br><br>He along with Shashank is doing a commendable job for yuktahaar mess and its their sheer dedication and hard work that its running so successfully these days. I'll always remember him as a guy who is always smiling and has been a good friend of mine throughout. Lekin bhai bohot bade frustu hain. Jidhar ladki dekhi, bas flat ho gae <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>All in all a very nice chap and buddy its always been fun talking to you. <br><br>Good luck. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitingupta.html>Nitin Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Guptha bhai itne seedhe hain ki unko dekhke kutte ki poonchh bhi sharma ke seedhi ho jae. When I met him for the first time, my first impression was that he is a tall, extremely thin guy with some wierd dressing sense and an equally wierd hair style. When I interacted with him, some of his character came out and his kind heartedness won over everything else.<br><br>I believe he is the most simple and down to earth guy in his group and that's why he is the favourite victim of being leofyed by others. He made "tha" legendary and you must see his face when someone calls him GupTHA <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is very helpful and socializes with many people in the college.<br><br>His dance style is just awesome. He is a  very good dancer but remains too stiff while dancing that his steps look weird. He needs to be a little more flexible.<br><br>A total fun loving guy who is always there to do BC and have fun. You will be staying in Hyderabad for a long time now and I hope we'll meet many more times after the college.<br><br>Good luck for the future and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitin.html>Nitin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bansi aka Bansal was among those guyz which I hated the most during the first 3 years. I never wanted to talk to him. I don't remember the exact reason behind this but it has to do something with his attitue. But thigs changed and when I actually talked to him, my perception changed. Now we are on very good terms and its always been fun talkin to him.<br><br>He is damn funny and leofy people like playing a game. When he comes on leofying someone, his victim just goes speechless and I feel its better not to respond otherwise you'll have to face some serious consequences. Soem of the great memories associated with him will be the Nagarjuna sagar trip, CL classes and my CL taship. Bhai sahab 1 bottle beer mein out ho jate hain aur phir jo harkatein karte hain wo dekhne layak hoti hain <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>We are not great friends  and I feel you cannot be with many people but what matters the most is that we do not have any hard feelings against each other. This will be the most important thing that will matter after we'll all leave the college.<br><br>I'm sorry for thinking so negative about you initially but its all good if end is good, so forget everything I said in the first paragraph and remember me as your CL tutor <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Good luck. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mridul, The NRI of our batch is one of those few guyz who have proved a lot of people wrong by doing somethings time n again. This chap has a reseaarch paper to his name during his BTech and thats not a small thing. Frankly speaking many people would not have thought that he'll get into any good university for higher studies, but he again proved everyone wrong and got admission in sone very gis universities. Hats of to you <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Leave aside the admission, I could not even think of him getting a good score in GRE and he was among the toppers in our batch. Don't know about others but I have always underestimated him and he has always stood upto the top and proved me wrong. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>No coming to a lighter side, this chap has some strange accent and he never opnes his mouth while speaking. People have leofyed him a lot for the same and he always took it in good spirit. He is a die hard cricket fan and its fun to see him debating him with someone over it. He remembers the exact stats associated with each n every ball that has been bowled till date. His gk is just awesome. He knows so much about evrything that its really hard to beat him. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He has worked his ass off in LTRC and all that has been paid off when he got calls from some big universities.<br><br>I just pray that you'll do great there and will become a great person.<br><br>Good luck and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>It's quite weird that with all the people, who are getting BIGGER testimonials from me, I share a very short period of interaction ranging from a maximum of 1.5 to 1 year and Adi is one of them. He is one of those guyz for whom I would have never imagined that he will become my good friend ever but now he is one of my closest buddies here. If I have to describe him in one word it would definitely be Mr. Gentleman. For me he is an epitome of knowledge. Be it browsing, studying, playing, music he is exceptional at everything he do. This testimonial might look too much arbit and not very well composed but it hardly matters because I wanted to put my feelings and I hope I did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We never interacted in the first year. He was the first one to own a laptop in our group and this was the reason I once went to his room to actually see how a laptop looks like. I so desperatley wanted to use it once but so many people were already present there that I left silently. The year passed on without any talks at all. His initial impression on me was of a total geek and a proudy guy who is so proud of his achievements that he does not like to people who are not upto his level. this was also one of the reasons which kept me from talking to him.<br><br>Then when I became the part of TB, interactions started. But still it would not be kept under the category of good friendship. We used to go out and he was the one who always beared the responsibilty of placing the order. Quite sophisticated, I must admit though he lost some of his sophistication to me and now I'm a little more sophisticated than him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He was one of the "Big 5" who were the ones who always planned to go out and never thought of consulting anyone. This sometimes pissed me off and this became another reason why I kept refraining from talking to him much.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2a</b><br><br>Initially in the first two years, he was a vegetarian and a non drinker. He was totally against nonveg and booze. We both shared the same opinion about these two though I had much stronger opposition. But eventually he fell  into the "darkness" of both <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and I used to think what a person he is who cannot stand onto his principles. But later when I myself did the same thing, my whole perception changed.<br><br>Then the things turned up drastically after the Goa trip in 3rd year. I drank for the first time there and fell in love with it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Since then, there had been a very few occasions when we drank and Adi was not there. A regular boozer who rarely says no to Club8 outings. He became our pseudo wing mate. You could always find him hanging in my room on weekends. I am so fond of shopping and he is a total shopping freak. You ask him for shopping and he will never let you down (though I lost a bet for this once <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> ). It's always fun to go shopping with him.<br><br>Now coming to his knowledge area, there are a very few things on this earth he doesn't know about. You just ask him something, he will give you atleast some information about it if not complete wikipedia. This is why we often call him "Mobile Wikipedia". his greteast passions include Rock music, cars and electronic gadgets. Initially when I heard him leistening to Rock music, I often wondered how can one listen to such a music and go head banging like freaks. He introduced me to rock and man now I understand why people are crazy about it. You name a car and he will tell you the biography of not only the car but also the company. His favourite pastime includes browsing and reading something or the other.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2b</b><br><br>It was his sheer dedication that he got an intern in Microsoft and later got placed there too. He is one of the laziest guyz I have ever met (after Raman) but this perception also changed after I saw him work day and nite for the placements. His work as the placement coordinator was commendable. Hats off to you bro for all that dedication. Frankly speaking, I and may others never imagined he will be able to do that much work and were quite shocked when he was appointed as placement cood. But he proved all of us wrong. He is also the most careless guy one can see.<br><br>Contd...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>I have shared some fantastic moments with him and MS party is one of them. It is definitely the most memorable party I have ever been to. Recent Maiden gig in Bangalore will be another one of such memories. It was a one-of-a-kind experience for me and it was freaking awesome. He is very brand conscious and never buys any stuff that is not branded. This is one aspect which I also adopted from him.<br><br>Its been said that daroo brings people close and here is an example which proves this. I think its the booze that brought us close and he became one of my closest buddies. I will cherish so many of those booze sessions in my room and outside where he was present and we just spoke our hearts out when drunk. He is definitely one of my closest buddies here and I feel very comfortable in sharing somethings with him which I find sometimes difficult to with someone else. I often turn to him in help and he never lets me down. <br> <br><b>Most memorable moment</b> would be MS party, Maiden gig and those numerous booze sessions.<br><br>No need to say that we'll stay in touch because you are placed in Hyderabad itself. I'm sure you'll do great in future. I hope the things will not change after you'll leave college because it would be very hard for me if something like that happens.<br><br>God bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Maglu and his Magli have always been a famous topic of discussion. His laughing style is just awesome. You see him alughing and you'll not be able to control yourself laughing. He is a die hard Australian cricket team fan and its been a favourite pastime of many of us to leofy him for the same. He keeps on arguing about the Australians and always gets raped by the others for suppoting them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>He had the courage to propose a girl in the first year and even though she refused, he never let that stop him and kept on as nothing happened. He was among my very first friends and I always loved leofying him.<br><br>He is very good at studies and strongly sticks to his point. Its very difficult to change his mindset. He is very hard working and is working his ass off compete his MS in due time. He has been a messcom and people have leofyed him  alot for that too. Whenener the food was not good, he was the one who got cursed by almost everyone.<br><br>I'll cherish so many of the moments spent with him and the outings with him in the first years. A very good friend indeed.<br><br>Loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> God bless you and Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Manish or Mux as we all call him is among those first person whom I interacted with in the initial days of the college. I used to visit his room and most of the time I could find him worshipping and chanting some mantras. He used to worship twice daily and that too with so much dedication that he didnt even realize if someone entered his room. He used to get a call from his parents daily and back then it really amazed me because my parents called me not more than twice a week. But he always kept his mobile in his suitcase and never took it out except for the time when his parents called him.<br><br>I remember he was the only one who had the courage to tell Zulu sir when the time for the class was over and ask him doubts during the class. We used to force him to speak and he did. He has made so many portals more than anyone else that he can be awarded as the Portal Boy or our batch. His voice is quite loud and one should see him when he is excited.<br><br>We have had many train journeys together back home and college. All of them have been so much fun. I have always enjoyed his company and I'll always do. He is also staying here for some more time for his MS and I'm happy that I have some more time to spend with his wonderful chap <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Good luck buddy for your MS and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met this chap for the first time during our SE presentation because he was my group partner. Then only I came to know about his bundle of intelligence and joy. He is very freindly and helpful. He thinks very analytically and woerked very hard for the presentation. Frankly speaking if he would not have been with us, we would have been totally fucked up in SE. Now whenever we see each other, we share a smile and usually a small talk about whats happening in our lives. Always it has been really nice talking to him.<br><br>During the MS internship interviews phase, when I heard that he was not selected it was very shocking for many of us. I always thought of him as an extremely intelligent guy and when he was rejected, it was really unexpected. But as expected he got placed in a good company with a decent package.<br><br>My best wishes for you buddy. God bless you always <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>His name itself tells one of his greatest qualities, GK, is an epitome of knowledge and dedication. In the initial years, I only heard about him like there is a guy who is very punctual and passionate about studies and used to finish all the assignments well in time. I never interacted with him because I felt he might be very proudy and arrogant. I also heard that many girls had a crush on him in the first year and this also carries on till date.<br><br>I actually came to know more about him when he did CL-2 with me and there I recognized him as the most sincere and studious guy in the class. He had more knowledge than many of the LTRC students though he himself had no relation with LTRC and language processing. Then I became his tutor in CL-1 and his script was among the first ones which I corrected. This could be because I felt his answers to be most precise and to the point and I had some sort of confident in his answers that if Gaurav has written this, it must be correct. And the main thing is he never proved my feeling wrong. Even Dipti ma'am is his big fan and she has admired him so many times in front of me.<br><br>Then we took a course comprising of 4 students and 3 faculty members. The 4 students being Gaurav, I, Chand and Himank. Here also he always remained in the limelight because of his knowledge and dedication. He completes his assignments well on time and this sometimes pissed me off <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. Usually it happened that when he submitted the assignment, I actually started doing that.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Coming to his other qualities, he is an excellent bb player and his english is among the best around the college. When he comes to doing BC, noone can beat him and this side became visible to me only during the Felicity'08. There are so many things to be learnt from him and I always try to be as much sincere as he is but never reach even upto a little level than his.<br><br>He has his priorities well defined and this makes him different from the mass. He has apllied for higher studies outside and I hope he'll get admitted to some very good college because he is the most deserving gyuz in our batch. i'm quite sure that after a few years he'll be somewhere where many of us dreamt of to be.<br><br>Good luck to you and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ye banda sala itna rota tha grades aur padhai ke liye ki irritate kar deta tha, though he maintained a goot CGPA. This was a prime reason ki isse baat karne ka bhi man nahin hota tha. I always ignored talking to him initially because whatever be the topic of chatting, he'll surely bring in grades and studies between. Though this aspect has changed a lot now and he has become more relaxed when it comes to acads.<br><br>He is a total sitcom and soaps freak. there isn't a single sitcom or soap on DC which he has not seen. This chap also knows the names of actresses in the you-know-what-type movies. Leave only name, he also knows the complete biodata of some of them. Bhai sahab music sunke movie identify kae lete hain. This shows his sheer dedication and passion towards you-know-what-type movies.<br><br>Really good at acads and this can be justified by his placement. He got placed on the first day itself and that too with the highest package. I feel this was the time when he actually became relaxed about grades n all.<br><br>We both belong to Rajasthan and its always special to talk to someone from your state or city. We have shared some fantastic journeys to our hometown and its always been fun travelling with him. For the first time he spoke his heart out on the juniors' booze treat and it felt very nice talking to him that nite.<br><br>All in all he is a very nice buddy, who has always been there and I know he will be there for me whenever I'll need him.<br><br>Good luck.

<b>For <a href=kapilagrawal.html>Kapil Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kapil Agrawal, one of the most sophisticated guyz I have met. Bhai 2 saal mera padosi raha lekin pehle ek saal to baat hi nahin hui kabhi bhi. He has this attitude that everyone is a jhandu here and I'm the bond. Whenever he speaks anything it definitely has mote than one meanings and janaab kabhi bhi seedhi baat nahin karte. But inspite of all this, I always enjoyed talking to him and it has been fun all the time in his company.<br><br>Well dressesd and very brand conscious, I have never seen him wearing anything that does not have a big brand tag. He used to keep his room clean and Sambhav was the one who made it untidy all the time.<br><br>He has his priorities set staright in his mind and he has some goals set. This is why he opted out of placements because he wants to do an MBA at any cost. This was a very tough decision I believe, but this shows how focussed he is towards his goals and ambitions. Hats of  to you buddy <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>I pray that you'll get whatever you wished for and will get into IIM-A one day. Best of luck mate.

<b>For <a href=kabeer.html>Kabeer Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Was not sure earlier if I'll write this or not but here I'm finally writing a testimonial for one of the best football players IIIT has ever seen, Kabeer. A very good bb player too. Infact you just name a sport and he will surely play it better than most of the people around. It has been said and heard so many times that Sardarjis are very funny and they possess a different sort of spirit in their character that makes them stand out in a crowd. I never realised this until I saw him. He has something to his character which makes him unique. His spirit and fun loving nature are the most admirable qualities about him.<br><br>I don't know much about him so cannot write a big one for him. But all in all he is a nice buddy, soft spoken and a great sportsperson.<br><br>I hope I'll write another one in near future.<br><br>Good luck.

<b>For <a href=dhingra.html>Hemant Dhingra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mera dullu bhai, Dhingra is the best TT player in the college. Quite hard working and dedicated towards everything he do. We are not great friends but whatever time we have interacted, its quite clear from that that he is very nice hearted and helpful. He always greets you whenever you see him and has this spirit associated with him which is kinda coool. If you see him plating volleyball, you'll notice that he is not a good player but this never stopped him from trying and he came daily to play. This never-say-die spirit is someting which makes him stand out.<br><br>Good luck for your MS. Apan to saath hi rehne wale hain to shayad aur testimonials aate rahenge.

<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harshita aka Moti will definitely be one of the most bubbliest and lively girl you can find. She always has something to say and that too something funny that will leave you only smiling. She was quite fatty during the initial years but I must say she has worked a lot and changed a lot during the last one year.<br><br>I know her right from the first year as we both shared the same section. I remember we used to make fun of her but I hope she never mined it because its all part of college life <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I deeply regret for an incident which happened during DBMS class in 4th sem. I made her cry and that was because of one of the silliest thing I have done in college. I'm extremely sorry for that. That day I felt she'll never talk to me again but thank god she forgave me and didn't take it seriously.<br><br>A damn good singer and an equally good dancer. Once you see her dancing and singing, you'll instantly fall in love with her talents. Her "zombie" will always be remembered as a song which tortured us for a longgggg time <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. During any singing competition, her name will definitely be there among the first two winners. I always feel she should try her hand at singing professionally and I will never be amazed if one day she'll be singing for some film or album.<br><br>She is childish to the core (or thats what she shows) and always do or say something silly. She has this habit of reading messages from boys mobiles and then reacting wierdly like she has read something **** and this has not happenned once <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Come on ... what else do you expect from a guyz mobile <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>She is the most talkitive girl in the batch and you can find him talking to the entire college it seems. A very rare quality found in girls. It's always fun to have her around. <br><br>Try not to change yourself and be the same as you are because you are toooo good.<br><br>Good luck for your MS. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harsh one of the most active students in the college. I remember him as the next roll number of Himank and I was quite amazed by the level of cheating he used to do during the exams. He and Himank used to sit one aftre the other and they cheatde like nothing else. Sometimes he used to turn completely and asking ans showing answers to Himank. I believe many of Himank's good grades are because of him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is very talkitive and that too quite loudly so it can be quiteirritating sometime. But this has never stopped me from talking to him because I always believed he is very kind and a nice chap. One of his best qualities is his helpful nature. You ask him for something and he will never let you down. Its really hard to find someone who thinks so much about others.<br><br>Right from the first year, he has been one of the brightest students both academically and otherwise. He has been active in all the activites during the course of out Btech. His dedication towards everything he do is really commendable and this can be justified by his CAT results. He is among those who got the maximum number of IIM calls and its really good to see that he finally converted most of them <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>I have always seen him as a good friend and will carry on the same. My only advice for him is speak a little <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>No need to say that you'll do great in your future because I believe you'll do <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Good Luck and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=khatri.html>Gaurank Khatri</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Undoubtedly one of the biggest BCbaaz in the entire batch, G Khatri is one of those people which I'll remember for a long time. In the first year I had this impression that he must be some gangster and he must have been to quite some number of times before coming to college <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He used to leofy people right from the first year and its going on till date. Quite huge and thats why his first impression might be quite fearful <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>I remember during the first years, his and our gangs had some differences and that's why there was no interaction at all except some fights. Once he passed some comments on someone from TB during some class and that day I saw Chand angry for the first time. It was very frightening and actually Khatri ki phat li thi. From that day onwards he never passed any comment or did anything against TB.<br><br>Be it his size or anger or his leofying nature, he had been treated as Gaurav Jain of our batch and juniors were afraid of him during our second year. He was among those few people who "ragged" the juniors. He hold a great repo among the seniors too. I believe he was never into studies and one could always find him leofying people here and there, his favourite victims being Raman and Mathur. You just ist with him and you'll be forced to laugh your heart out. His one liners are just toooo awesome and its always fun to have him around.<br><br>A football freak and a decent cricket player. These days he is obsessed with gyming and one should see his commitment towards that. Badminton in the moring and evening and rigorous gyming in the evening. Volleyball after that. Looking at him you can never imagine he can do all that.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=khatri.html>Gaurank Khatri</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>One of the most shocking moment of my college life would be his internship in MS. When the news came out that he got an intership in MS, half of the college was literally dead by the shock of this news. I don't think even he himself ever dreamed of it. But whatever it is,  he proved his mettle and he actually did his internship there <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. The same goes for his placement. Frankly speaking, I never imagined he would be placed so early but he did and hats off to him for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>His true nature came out in the third year or so and then I realised that he is not at all like what he looks like. Theres much more to him and I'll cherish so many of the bc sessions where he was present. Raman's usualy dialogue describing him is "Yaar man to mera bhi hota hai uski maarne ka lekin saala itna bada bakchod hai ki ek saath 4-5 sentences bol deta hai aur mujhe kuch bolne ka time hi nahin milta" <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><br>He shares some wierd relationship with Pappu and one should see them when they are together (not to mention the junior booze treat when he bargained for him in exchange of a vodka <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ). They share some strange chemistry which is out of this world <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <br><br>All in all it has been a fun ride with him from a daraawanaa character to a lively, always laughing chap.<br><br>Hope you'll great in future.

<b>For <a href=dharmeet.html>Dharmeet Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Babaji aka Dharmeet Paaji is one of the most religious guy I have ever met. He stayed in cellar in the first two years. He used to wake up early in the morning and do regular prayers daily. There has been some times when it was the time for me to sleep and he was busy doing his daily chores. He was the one who had a refrigerator and was a supplier of milk to many people.<br><br>His jokes are somewhat out of this world. It actually needs some time to understand them. I usually interacted with him during meals in yuktahaar. He is very soft spoken. Usually its really hard to listen to him because he speaks so softly.<br><br>One advice for him would be to come out of his closet and enjoy the life because this is the time of our lives and it will never come back.<br><br>God bless you. Good luck for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deepti is among those few girls, I interacted with. By all the interactions we had, I can say one thing about her that she is a very descent and cultured girl. She always greets you whenever you pass her and she always has this lovely smile on her face. These days she is doing a commendable job for "Samvedana" and hats off to you for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I hope you will take it to greater heights. Matured upto an extent, very studious and maintains an awesome CG. She has something to her personality that draws people towards her. I always enjoy talking to her.<br><br>She is very hard working. One could always find her working in the lab in the 3rd year. It takes great courage to opt CVIT for your honours <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and she had that courage ^<img src=Smileys/2.gif />^. I feel she knows how to find happiness in whatever she does and this quality is the most adorable one.<br><br>There is more to write but couldn't find words to put into. I hope I'll write something more later. Recently I met with an accident and she was among those few peopleo always asked me how I was feeling. It might seem a very small thing but it matters a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Unfortunately she too had an accident and I hope she'll recover soon from that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>My best wishes for you.

<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deepak is by far the most skinniest guy I have ever met. Very shy kinda, quite reserved and silent type. We both stayed in cellar for the first two years but we could see him out of his room very few times. We usually talked during our meals in yuktahaar. Very friendly, soft spoken, disciplined and quite cultured. Its really hard to find him doing BC on a regular basis. <br><br>We have not talked much but the time that we have, I always enjoyed his company. Its really good to have him around. You can also find him leofying people in the mess though this happens rarely. Recently we all came to know about his volleyball skills. By looking at it one can never think that he will be able to push the ball but you see him playing and he will make you eat your own words.<br><br>May you do wonders in your future.<br><br>God bless you.

<b>For <a href=sankhlecha.html>Bharat Sankhlecha</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bharat or Bhartu, as sed to call him, is one of my first friends in college. There was a time when he was my best friend. But things changed so very much that now we don't even talk. Its not like that we had a fight or something but the circumstances were such that we drifted apart. I remember when we studied together for exams in his room. I used to roam around with him and do lots of BC. I had a great time with him in the initial days of my college life. My first outing was also with him to Koti to buy books.<br><br>But as soon as I became a part of TB, a started spending less time with him and thats when actually our friendship took an opposite turn. I seriously regret this now because I never wanted to lose him. But now when I look at him, it feels very good to see that he is doing great in his academic life. He has also changed a lot and looks like he has matured a lot. <br><br>I'll always remember him as my first friend and he'll always be my friend no matter we talk or not. I hope its the same for him too.<br><br>May god bless you to reach great heights in future. Good luck for whatever you do.

<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>We started interaction only after I danced for some event. That day onwards, he named me "Dancer bhai" and always teases me for the same. A very friendly guy who always has some cheap and wierd thoughts in his mind. Do not fear in saying anything in front of anyone. Uses abusive language as if bhagwaan ka naam le raha ho. Always ready for BC and a great friend. These days one can find him at the coffee shop. You go there anytime and he will be present there.<br><br>Music se kuch alag hi rishta hai. Dholak maestro, lead guitarist of IIIT Rock band and one of the vocalist too <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. his musical performances have always been special and memorable but his "kalifornicason" performance is the most memorable one. His accent is quite funny and its fun to listen to him speaking. His sense of humour is quite weird. You should read his testimonials and will understand by urself. <br><br>All in all a very good friend and a nice person at heart who do not think bad for others.<br><br>Good luck for your future.

<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Tullu Ram, my Ajmeri brother, the biggest BCbaaz of the college. You can always find him BCing somewhere in  the college. Be it mess, class, lab or hostel he is always doing some random and arbit BC. One of the best bloggers. His stories are just too good and always fun to read. Quite a good poet though I never understood his poems. English guru becoz instead of studying ABC, he studies ZABC (as stated by Maroo <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>I met him on the first day of college where he ws roaming with his father. Though we studied at the same coaching institute, we never met each other there. Earlier he was Raman's roommate but due to "some" issues Raman later shifted to my room. Used to smoke a lot but I'm quite happy to see that he has quit it now.<br><br>Once he is drunk, he becomes a real pain in the ass. How hard you try to send him to his room, he will never stop giving his ideas on arbit issues. I remember the recent Felicity's last night when he was not in his conscious and he came to my room. He taught me so many of his fundes.<br><br>How can one forget his trekking and running passion. A good athelete. You can easily award him "The Tarzan" of our batch. Never into studies though he god placed in BOA. Good job there bro. There must be a very few incidents during our 4 years of college life where he  not involved. You name a kaand, and he must be among the first ones involved in that. How can one forget the "Farewell" one last year <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>But all in all a very good person. Pure at heart and never takes anything seriously. Very helpful and friendly to its core. No matter waht people say about you, you are very good and be the same as you are except the BC thing. Thodi to kam kiya kar yaar, itni energy aati kahan se hai tujhmein.<br><br>God Bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kyun ? Kaise ? Kab ? Kahan ? Kaun ?<br><br>KATLI bhai is full of questions and loads of questions. You say one sentence and his reply will be a long list of questions. Mera Rajasthani bhai, shared same coaching institute. His questions are sometimes very irritating and thats why I never interacted much with him. I feel his ques asking tendency has reduced a bit. Once we were travelling in train and some guy was reading Word Power and Kabra bhai saw him doin that. He started his questions about the book and went on for like hours (it seemed to me like hours <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). From that day onwards I always refrained from travelling with him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>But I must admit that he is quite good at whatever he does. Manintained a decent CG throughout. Don't know why did he took so much time to get placed but that doesn't matter much because funally he did. Just want to ask him one thing - bhai itne kyun question poochhta hai tu ?<br><br>Good luck. God Bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My classroom neighbour in the first year, Akash is one of the most composed and descent guyz around. During class and assignment sessions, his coding skills always amazed me. I always wondered, how can someone with his skills got into EC and not into Comp Sci. I pity you for that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He was always among those who used to finish the C assignments before time. His workspace system was among the best configured and I often used his to watch movies. We shared some nice time during the classes and I had a great time being his neighbour. After 1st year things changed and our interaction level went down but this never let me feel different about him.<br><br>I still look at him as one those persons whom I will remember for a long time be it for his coding skills, his friendly and helping nature, cheerful attitude, sincerity and dedication.<br><br>Good luck mate.

<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Alok aka Ganja is oen of those few guys whose company I'll always cherish. I must say, he is one of the most cultured and matured guys around. We both stayed in cellar and its there I came to know more about him. He is quite sophisticated too. Always ready to help and a down to earth guy. I remember once, he praised me so much in his room <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I don't know if he was serious or not but mate I liked it very much <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. One could see his dedication during the placements when he was the only person in the batch other than the pc members, who volunteered there day in and day out.

<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Somani bhai, coding genious <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I have never seen a bettre coder than him. He must have won more awards in different coding competitions than the number of codes I have written in my entire life till date. His speaking style is quite unique. Very lazy though he loves to do BC whenever he gets time from coding. You utter his name and the one word that comes to your mind is "Coding". You might feel that I have used coding so many times in this testimonial but this is what he is and it is the one thing that describes his complete personality. I feel he does everything by writing a code for it. He is the most deserving guy to be placed in Google <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Bhai there is life outside coding world and it has many more things to offer. just come out of your closet and enjoy the life.<br><br>God Bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Apne scientist bhai, one of the sweetest person one can find. You say him anything and he never gets angry. His PJs are a real pain in the ass and sometimes really really difficult to listen to him. I usually meet him on the dinner table and he always has thi smile which will make you smile and greet him. Very innocent and pure at heart. I don't think he ever keeps hard feelings for anyone. I remember one incident during Ragging sessions when we were told to do the legendary "athhanni chawanni" and he refused. That day he was treated quite differently by the seniors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I always enjoy his company and will have the privelege to have some more time with him due to our MS <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>God bless you. Good luck for your MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinav_mehta.html>Abhinav Mehta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is the simplest and the most genuine guy I have ever met. Always carrying a smile which will force you to greet him and smile even if you don't want to. I feel noone can ever be angry with him. A very sweet and soft spoken guy who is always ready to help you no matter who you are. Quite discplined and has somewhat different perspective towards life. I feel he is one of those few people who were influenced by Jeevan Vidya. I remember one incident during Felicity when some group was presenting a dance. As usual people were passing comments and shouting. He became so angry by this that started fighting with us. I appreciate his views but that really pissed off many of us and he should not try to force things on others.<br><br>You have always been a guy who cheered me up with your smile. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>God bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Keep smiling <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhilash, one of the allrounders of our batch. He is good at everything he do. Be it academics or sports. One can find him playing every evening. You name the game and he plays it. A multi talented personality. An excellent football player, he plays TT, badminton, basketball, volleyball, cricket and many more. Coming to academics, bond at coding. I can remember, Pagare always telling about his coding skills in the first year. Maintains a decent CG. Initially he was quite cut off from the outer world and one could rarely find him interacting to people. But this aspect has changed a lot after I guess he watched "Happy Days". It takes great courage to convert to dual degree from Btech. Hats off to you for this <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Has won many awards in international and national coding competitions. I must say, he has got a proper research oriented mind.<br><br>No need to say this because I'm quite sure that you will do great in future. Do your MS quickly and go so that we will get a chance to complete our MS <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>God bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Whenever I think of him or the time spent with him, it only brings smiles and loads of smile on my face <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. This is Pagare aka Pappu for you who is always there to cheer you up. Always  he has one or the other weird and witty idea going inside his head which will atleast make you smile if not laugh <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. A true friend indeed who is always there to help you. Whenever you want to do BC, just call him and he will never let you down. Aur koi ho na ho, pappu to hoga hi. He is always eager to go home and has not missed a single chance since first year <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His life revolves around his friends and family <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Our interaction did not start on a good note. Actually I hated him a lot in first year <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He used to come to my room to talk to Raman and never talked to me. It was like I could not even bear the sight of him and so whenever he visted my room, I usually avoided him and used to go to Himank's room <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He always blames me for this but he was equally responsible and never took the initiative to talk. I was very reserved and silent type in my first year. So I was never used to  talk to anyone first from my side. One could find him always in my room sleeping or doing random BC. Sometimes I do got irritated by this and this was one of the reasons I actually wanted to change my room <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. <br><br>Be it because of his dancing, his friendly nature or ever smiling cute face, starting right from the ragging (read interaction) sessions, he has been one of the most popular guyz of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He did some stupidity on the stage on Freshers nite and that's why Chand got the title of Mr. Fresher <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> otherwise no-one could have stopped him from becoming Mr. Fresher <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> though he became Mr. Popular <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. His room NBH-47 was one of the most famous rooms because of the BC sessions held there. It was the hot spot for all the BC sessions. Though I never attended any sessions there, I heard a lot about it from Raman and Himank. I also heard that he was very famous among the fairer sex in GH <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Come second year and things started changing a bit. He topped midsem-1 in OS and got his name "Baba", though he never repeated that feat <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. No one can ever forget that "Baba ki Sawaari" from motorola to OBH and then in the OBH mess. How can one forget 12th July. You could see him crying, shouting on people and doing some crazy things out on the road from NBH to OBH <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Such a behaviour was very new to me because it was the first time I encountered a drunkard <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>When we shifted to OBH, we actually started talking and had some awesome BC. In NBH, his room was the BC room but here in OBH mine was the one and sometimes I really got pissed off with this. I like my room to be very tidy and clean and usually after some BC session is over, my room becomes so messy that I cannot take. I'm not good at telling things on people's  face and he often tells me to change this habit and suggests me to just say it if I don't like something but I cannot :|. <br><br>In the last summer holidays, he somehow managed to get an internship in Microsoft - Bangalore (I still wonder how did he do that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). He called me once from there and it was quite surprising and unexpected as I could have never expected a call from him <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. One day I somehow managed to convince Maroo that my marriage is fixed. I don't know how but he convinced Pappu about the same <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Hats off to Maroo for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> because I could have never imagined that Pagare will believe something like that. He called me that night and shouted that how can I do such a thing and blah blah. He reciprocated with something similar and much more shocking few days back. He told me something so shocking that I could not believe it for quite some time but eventually I did because he told me with so much conviction that no one could have disagreed with him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. That whole day I could not do anything, just pondered over it and that ass told me in the evening that it was just a joke. Man to aisa ho raha tha wahin maar doon use <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br>In Microsoft-Hyd's 10th anniversary party, I said him somethings which I shouldn't. I'm extremely sorry for that and deeply regret for the same. He is one of the reasons why I patched up with Raman after our long running fight. He always insisted me for talking to Raman and finally I did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... <br><br>I don't know how and when exactly, but we have become very good friends in the last 5-6 months. Frankly speaking if someone would have asked me if I would write a testimonial for Pappu a year back, my answer would have probably been a "NO". Now I'm here with such a big testimonial, shows that things gave turned up drastically between us <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He always leofy me. I usually enjoy his leofying but sometimes he just pisses me off. He needs to learn where to draw the line and he sometimes crosses the line and says something which he shouldn't have. He has a peculiar quality of pointing out very minute things in people's behaviours'. He has given me the name "Budhau" <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> and that too for a wierd reason. Actually he called me Dadaji  and later he realised that its too respectful and changed it to Budhau. Most of the names given to the people around are result of his mastermind. I enjoy each n every moment spent with him and he always makes me laugh <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Aajkal use naya hi shauk chadhha hai. Koi bhi gane ki parody banata rehta hai aur us parody mein ya to "baal" hote hain ya "budhau" ya dono <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... bechara bohot speed se ganja ho raha hai <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>He always used to say that he will not cry for going to Pune whatever happens but last time when we were drunk he just broke down. I could not handle this and started crying myself. Later he just came to me and said something in my ear. From that instant itself I started laughing and kept on laughing for the next 5 minutes. This is how he is, changing moods so frequently that its difficult to judge what's going on in his mind <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. <br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 4</b><br>Looks can be deceptive and this aptly suits him. You see him and first thing that strikes you is his cute and innocent looking face. But believe me he is not at all innocent. He is one of the sharpest and cunniest person I have ever met <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I'm not sure about this but people often say that earlier he used to be very open and frank, used to say anything about him to anyone. But now, he doesn't and its really really difficult to get something out of him. This shows his level of maturity and sincerity. But still he is very childish <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. His body is so flexible that four equally sized Pagares can sleep on one hostel bed "comfortably" without disturbing one another <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He holds some strange chemistry with Raman and Vibhav <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Sabki daroo isi ne start karayi hai. He is so good at convincing that one cannot refuse him anything <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>As I mentined before, he does not open up easily and its really really tough to make him speak anything about himself. Whenever I ask him something his reply is "are dade ab kya bataun main tujhe, tum samjhoge nahin. itni badi story hai iske peechhe ab kya hi bataein tumhe" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>If I have to pick a bad quality of him, it would be his selfishness. He is a bit selfish at times. But he has so many other qualities that one can just overlook this one <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Recently I noticed one more thing about him. He is very proudy and thinks that he is the most perfect guy and every other person is a ch***ya. He feels whatever he says is correct and others are wrong in whatever they say or do. But my dear this is not rue at all <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. One more problem is that he cannot take anything said against him and he needs to work on it. Sabki maarta rehta hai but just as you say anything against him he gets angry.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 5</b><br>He got placed in the initial days itself and that too with a handsome package but the problem is that he will be going to Pune. I'm gonna miss him a lot because I love it when he leofy me and cheer me up when I'm down <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. I'm so used to his leofying that I cannot stay for a day without that. He is among those very few people who have made such an impression in my life that will be long lasting and will never fade away.<br><br><b>Most memorable moment</b> will be the Microsoft party, your marriage chat in canteen and those infinite moments when you teased me.<br><br>Don't ever change yourself for anything. You are very good and there are very few of your kind left here <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Mind your words sometimes. I'm eagerly waiting for "that" future when we will talk <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>May god bless you with all the happiness.

<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mathur aka mathura aka girgit aka TK is a perfect blend of kameenapan and innocence. When he gets down to kameenapan, no one can beat him. But he has this other side of him and that is he is very childish and innocent. This was recognized very late by me. He is very good to some people and never do anything against them. I feel very happy to belong to that elite group of people. A very good TT player and a CS freak.<br>I first met him on the very first day of college. He was sitting there in 119 with his father. First glimpse of him and you could judge he is very simple, down to earth and seedha saadha, chhota sa bachha. Though some days later he started showing his true colors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Since we both were from Rajasthan, his father suggested that we should take rooms together but he was sorted in Vayu house and I in Aakash, so that was not possible. He was alloted a room in GHEB and I got one in NBH. Due to this the interaction level was very less. I can remember his workspace PC was quite good and mine was totally sucked up. So I often used his to watch movies and do assignments. But frankly speaking, uska first impression to chutiye wala tha aur wo abhi tak kuch khaas change bhi nahin hua hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Later in second year he shifted to NBH but that too on 2nd floor. But he used to come to cellar and that's when we actually became friends and interacted with each other. Then I realised his true talents and for me his image sort of started changing. He stayed alone in NBH room when we all had to stay with partners. This made me very jealous of him. Jab bhi ghar se aata tha, mast naashta leke aata tha. His homemade cakes are just awesome. In 2nd year summers, we both took a project in LTRC and he was my partner and was quite hardworking. I must admit here that he is very good at coding and I just did the debugging and thinking part. I used to explain things to him and he just coded them nicely. He is good at studies but quite careless and never studies. You can always find him moving from one room to another in his peculiar style. <br>Then when we shifetd to OBH, he got a room on the 3rd floor when everyone else was on 2nd floor. But this didn't stopped him from coming down and he was a kind of pseudo wingmate because most of the time you could find him in our wing. Internet freak, net disconnect ho jaye isse bardaasht nahin hota. He was the prime reason we all planned to go for Goa trip which was one of the best experiences of my life. We had a  blast there and enjoyed it to the fullest. He did something there which really pissed me off and I could not even bear a sight of him for some days. This was because I didn't know him properly at that time and so could not understand his behaviour but now its all fine and happy between us. <br>In the 4th year, he finally shifted to my wing and his one more passion came into highlight. The passion of watching each and everything that's been put up on DC. He do not leave a single video on DC unwatched. Whenever you go to his room, you can find him watching some video and that too forward kar karke. Downloading ka bhi bada shauk hai. He always keeps on downloading something or the other stuff from net and then boasts about the same.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>His testimonial would not be complete without mentioning his colour changing ability <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. This is why he has been awarded with the "Human Chameleon" award, also famous as "Laal Tamaatar" because of the same. He just goes red time to time. Once when Chand was shouting in the wing, he was sleeping inside his room and he became all red with fear <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. You just rub a finger anywhere on his body and it looks like a birth mark for some days. He is one of the most friendly person in our batch. He talks to everyone and is friends with so many people. Its very easy to irritate him. You should see him when Himank irritates him.<br><br><b> Most memorable moment </b> would be fight between him and Maruti in 329 <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, project phase in 2nd and 3rd year.<br><br>Good luck for your MS. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mota aka Mumme is the fattiest guy in our batch. Proportionate to his body size are his emotions and feelings for his friends and family. He cries like a baby and its very very easy to make him cry. Quite intelligent and creative to the core. You see his sketches and instantly fall in love with his art.<br>I met him in second year when he shifted to NBH cellar as Shrikant's roommate. I used to look at him as one disgusting person who didn't know how to carry oneself. I used to pity on him and wondered how can someone let loose himself and get so obese. Due to such impression I restrained talking to him. But when we started interacting, things started changing. I came to know a lot about him and realised that he is not as bad as I thought of him. He has a peculiar way of leofying people which is very irritating and thus people often get offended by this (I being the one offended maximum no of times). <br>He is a guy who is very very good to his friends. You can always trust on him to be there whenever needed. He will do anything for his friends and thats one quality which I like the most in him. Coming to his creative skills, he is just awesome. All the creative work in Felicity was because of him and it was the first time when the campus was "actually" decorated during Felicity. He always has some amazing ideas going inside his mind that noone can beat him when it comes to creativity (except Chand <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). <br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When it comes to studies, he is very sincere and dedicated towards that. This was reflected when he got placed on the second day itself with highest package in the batch. For the first time in my entire academic career, I got an "F" in a course in the college and that too because of him. I was very angry with him when I heard that but later realised that he did not do it intentionally and he was very sorry for that. When it comes to booze, you just make him drink and then just sit back and watch him do some really wierd stuff. When he first smoked, he did it with such a perfection that even regular smokers were amazed by his talent. From that day onwards Pappu gave him another name which I should not mention here <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>He always teases someone or the other for something. I don't like it at all when he does so to me and that's why we have some differences between us. I have even shouted on him so many times for that. He beats people like some wild animal on their birthdays and the problem is that he never admits that. His birthdays have always been special his last one being the most as he took all of us for a treat to Ohri's Banjara where he himself paid for his cake <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>My only advice to him would be try to control yourself and learn to understand when people are getting irritated by your deeds <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> aur thoda kam roya kar yaar <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><b> Most memorable moment </b> would be that "F in DBMS" incident.<br>Good luck.

<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Chirag, or more popularly known as Cheeka, is one of those few guys who have not changed in the course of last four years. For him, it can definitely be said that he is just the same as he was 4 years back. One of the shortest guys in the batch, he is a proper timetable. Though Maroo was also a timetable earlier but he has changed a lot in the last 1 year. But Chirag, he is still a timetable. He has a fixed schedule for everything and he just sticks to that unless there's some special ocassion. He is the one who has attended least number of BC sessions. Very sincere and dedicated towards everything he do. Very good at academics.<br>Though he is very short, he is very good at basketball. Recently when we started playing volleyball, he played that too with perfection. He as maintained a decent CG throughout and got placed with a good package. <br>When it comes to leofying, no one can beat him. During BC sessions, he just release some witty quotes in between that leaves everyone laughing. He is one of the wittiest guys I have seen. But when some one tries to leofy him, his obvious reply is "haan bas tu to rehne hi de". He cannot take anything said against him and that's why gets angry very easily. I feel he needs to change in this aspect. <br>He never opens up and this is the reason why no one knows much about him. He never shares his personal life with others. Most of the time he just stays in his room and one can find him only during the meals in mess.<br>When drunk, he just becomes a superhero and always try to do something or the other which they do. He just run here and there, climb on the walls, insists on jumping from the wall and many more such super stunts....<br><b> Most memorable moment <b> would be Holi incident in 3rd year <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>We have not interacted much. So I cannot say much about him. But all I know is he is quite friendly and will do wonders in future. Just be more open towards relationships <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Good luck.

<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Its kinda difficult to write a testimonial for Prashasti because she possess so many different attributes to her personality that it sometimes becomes really hard to understand her. Every time I feel I know her well, she brings out yet another attribute and proves me wrong and I feel many people who know her will agree upon this. I don't have a sister of my own so I was always jealous of people who have one. So I wanted one desperately and what could be a better choice than Prashu who is so caring and sensitive. I never talked to her in first two years but still every time I looked at her, I always thought I should have a sister like her and finally in 3rd year it happened. She is very understanding, strong and and a very good sports person.<br><br>In 5th sem, some of us decided to watch Harry Potter 5 in IMAX and she was also interested in coming with us. But I didn't want her to come and so I said "if she will come, I won't go" and finally she didn't. The reason behind this was that I didn't know her and didn't use to talk to her then and so I always felt very awkward in her company. When I faced her later, that was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I realized that it was very bad on my part and I even said sorry to her and she instantly forgave me. I respect that a lot because I know if some person would have said something like that for me than probably  I would have never forgiven him/her. I deeply regret from my heart for that stupid behaviour of mine. After that everything changed between us and now she is my sister, one of my best friend. I love the way she handles her problems and I always look upon her when in trouble for a solution. She is really strong inside and I can see, she is getting more strong day by day. <br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>On my last b'day, she and PK brought a pizza cake for me (it was simple pizza. I named it cake because she asked me to take a slice and eat it thinking it a cake). That was a unique way to celebrate a b'day. She also presented me a gift which was the best gift I ever had. It was very special because she made it by herself (though PK claims he also helped <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, not sure about that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). Thanx a lot for making that b'day so special.<br><br>An excellent sports person. Exceptionally good in academics. Don't know if its luck or she is that intelligent <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, I feel even if she would leave her exam script empty, I'm sure she will manage to get a B in the subject. She got placed on the first day of placements and that too in Amazon with highest package in our batch. By all of what I have seen so far, nothing wrong has happened with her <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, except one and I pray nothing to happen in future. For that exception also, I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope it will also turn into something good for her. <br><br>What I love the most about her is her decency and sincerity. She will never do anything which will offend her family. She can find happiness in very small things and that's what make her so special and simple. You meet her once and for sure you can't forget her for long. Very sincere and dedicated. She is very possessive about her family and friends. She is very adjusting and can cope up with diverse situations. Always boasts that she own a driving license (though she didn't passed the test for it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and knows how to drive a bike. Gets angry very quickly and its really hard to make her smile when she is upset. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>She is a perfect combination of beauty with brain. She is also a perfect blend of Indian and western cultures. She respects Indian culture and traditions will never offend them.

I knew him because of Himank and some others because Himank was like a common friend between us. When I joined TB, I came to know that people tease him a lot for his roommate. I remember only once going to his room on 2nd floor and that too to borrow some book. I used to go out with Himank or PK when he was also there but never talked to him actually. When everyone was going home in the summer vacations, someone was going home and we all went to see him off. Maroo started crying that how will we stay away for 3 months. I was simply amazed that how can someone behave like this. But now I realise that emotion completely and hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to him for being such a good person at heart and a really good friend.<br><br><b>2nd Year</b><br><br>Then in the second year, he shifted to Cellar and thats when we actually started talking. We both had same sleeping times. We both woke up in the morning for breakfast and used to chat about something. It was then that I came to know much about him and realised some of his fine qualities. He was good at studies, always managed to finish his asisgnments on his own <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, spend time with friends. In all, he managed his time perfectly by devoting sometime for everything. I always relied on him for clearing doubts and providing textbooks.<br><br>Contd...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Due to some ragging issues, he had DISCO on him. Everyone in the batch knew he was not guilty. Except that some really harsh decisions were passed by the DISCO committee against him. It was then that the whole batch stood by him and fought for him. The batch unity was visible for the first time then. I still remember the day, when he came back from his hearing and had a letter in his hand. He just sat there on his bed crying. I wanted to console him but there were so many of his close friends there that I thought its better to leave him there with them becuase we were not very close then. I felt really bad that day. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br><b>3rd Year</b><br><br>When we shifted to OBH, he stayed alone in a wing. He made some very "good"friends in that wing <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. His room was such a mess that one had to find space to keep a foot inside. I always wondered how did he manage to reach his bed and cupboard. He even missed our Goa trip. I realised his leadership qualities during the 3rd year when he conducted our Felicity so efficiently. He was the unanimous choice of the batch for the coordinator. That Felicity was the best, IIIT has ever seen. As it is said in Hindi, kutton ki tarah kaam kiya usne. I never thought that he will booze. But that myth was broken on Felicity third nite. He drank then and was out soon. He cried n cried (though I missed all the drama because of manish and mota <img src=Smileys/14.gif />). One day after that, we again had a boozing session and he again cried that nite <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Unknowingly he hurt me that nite but it doesn't matter now because we have come across so many things after that, that such small things doesn't count in our friendship. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is also dedicated very much towards Cricket. He is a very good bowler and holds the record for never getting out in entire college life, his top score being 2 notout. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I used to make fun of him earlier for this but this never stopped him in praticing more n more and become such a good bowler. Hats off to him for his spirit. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Contd....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>4th Year</b><br><br>I always respected him for his qualities and never thought we could be such good buddies. He is among those very few guyz who managed to do an intern in both 2nd and 3rd year. First in Greenspace and second one in MS. During the summers when he was in Bangalore, my neighbour shifted somewhere else. So I tried to get him in that room and talked to Bala for that. But he put a condition that he will allow Maroo to shift only if his current room is vacated within 3-4 days. I said yes at that time not realising what have I accepted. Later when I entered his room, it took me some time to decide whether I should shift his belongings or not. It was a horrible scene to look at his room when you know you have to shift all of that stuff somewhere else. But I must confess that it was more my swaarth than desire to bring him in my neighbouring room. So I had to do that and I did. It took me 3 hours to select what all to take. I think this was among my wisest and most beneficial decisions <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Since then our friendship reached greater heights. He is my breakfast partner. I always talk to him when I'm upset and he is always there to help me. We had some great booze sessions. He is the other guy who always gets senti when drunk (I being the first one <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). He boasts of never puking after drinking  (itni kam peeta hai, ho hi nahin sakti <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I always tease him with some girl name and sometimes he gets angry also. He has some strange way of reacting to things. He just starts speaking very loudly and it looks like he is angry and ready to beat someone. But he says its not the case and its just his way of reacting. If someone points this out and says that he gets angry on every thing, he gets irritated like hell and actually gets angry. He could not even listen a wrong thing about him but this has changed a lot over time. Kisi ki bhi mar rahi ho, use hamesha pata hota hai kaise topic khudpe divert karna aur apni marwana. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> But this has changed a lot. I quit smoking because of him. <br><br>Contd....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One must have seen his dedication for CAT. He prepared extremely well for that but when the results were out, things didn't turned up in his favour. This disappointed a lot of people. But he performed brilliantly in his IIM-I interview (though he don not want to join it) and I pray that he should get an admission into IIM-I. Whether he joins or not, it does not matter but he should clear it. Actually I don't want him to join personally because he deserves more than this and will surely succeed if he'll give it a try next year. He always stand for his friends  and expects very much from his friends. But when he does not get the same, he get pissed off and so sometimes he is very difficult to handle. His anger is like on the tip of his nose. Gets angry very soon but it settles down more quickly. He cannot listen anything wrong.<br><br>Many more things to say... probably will come in another testi. For now, just want to say that its been a great journey with you and will miss you a lot (atleast he is placed in Hyd). I admire you for your dedication, sincerity, hard work and your friendly nature. From sometime back you have changed a lot. Hope you will not loose these qualities ever.<br><br>My <b>most memorable moments</b> with him would be the breakfast sessions right from the 2nd year and the "banana" one Club8 outing. <br><br>Good luck. God Bless U. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>saale ab tujhe ideas nahin aate likhne ke to doosron ko gaali kyun de raha hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>For me, writing a testimonial is very difficult because I share a very different sort of bonding with him.  But somehow I started writing it and got this.<br><br>Chand, our beloved Netaji, is a very good orator. He keeps on speaking for hours and you will never get bored in his  company. A very patient listener too, you can share anything with him and he has a solution ready with him for almost  everything. He is my neighbour in OBH and I'm a constant victim of his bullying <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. I leofy him a lot but he  reciprocate the same to me in a better way (these days <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We keep on doing this whole day and I just enjoy every  second spent with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He boasts of possessing one of the best bodies in our college which I think is true upto some  extent <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Friendly to its core, I have never seen someone more friendlily than him. You roam around in the campus with  him and every other minute he greets someone or the other. Everyone knows him in the college, ranging from first years  to MS, PhDs and the faculty and guards and even the supporting staff. <br><br>Contd.....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>1st Year:</b><br>I hardly talked to him in my first year as I stayed in cellar and he was staying on first floor. At that time I thought  of him as a very arrogant sort of a person who just keeps on boasting about himself all the time, talks so loudly and  was quite jealous with all the fame he got in the first year. I don't even remember a 'hi' or a 'hello' shared between  us at that time. I didn't like the way he used to dance, I think the expressions were pathetic and I thought of him as one of  the worst dancers I have seen when it comes to expressions <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Though barring the expressions, his dance style was quite  good. Even before winning the Mr. Fresher title, he became the hero of our batch. He was very famous among the seniors  and us. We first years' had to perform a small programme on 26th January wherein I danced for the first  time in college. During the practise sessions, I realised that he is not that bad as I thought of him. He was very helpful, very  cooperative. He helped me get the things ready, encouraged me a lot. This boosted my morale very much and I owe him my  first performance in IIIT which was great success (I performed the same dance two more time after that and that's all  because he pressurised me very much to do so <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). After I became a part of TB, I started talking to him but even that  was just a smile pass or a 'hello'.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>2nd Year:</b><br>Second year did not bring any major advancement in our friendship except that I started liking his dance because he had  actually worked a lot on his expressions. That 'hello' transformed into little BC sessions we had in his room or  in outings. I used to visit his wing and he just used to beat me. He has a great body and just to show off that, once he just  threw me in his wing from one wall to another. I was one of his favourite victims to try out new techniques of beating  people (this is true even now <img src=Smileys/2.gif />).<br><br><b>3rd Year:</b><br>Then the third year brought about a drastic change in our bonding. We shifted to OBH and I somehow got a room near his  (I don't know how did this happen <img src=Smileys/7.gif />). I didn't actually want to be his neighbour and I realised that it same was with him. This may be because we didn't talk much at that time and so we both wanted someone else to be our neighbours.  But this is exactly opposite now and I feel very lucky because otherwise we would have never become such good friends.  He used to ask me daily for toothpaste, he often woke me up just for toothpaste (even though I keep on refusing to open  the door <img src=Smileys/14.gif />). I kept on shouting on him for that and finally all my shouting got paid off and he started buying his own  toothpaste. Its hard to find him in the wing (as he always has someone or the other to roam around with <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) but when he  does, he keeps on talking and shouting "Maroo" in some peculiar way and just roaming door to door in the wing. He has a  favourite pastime of showing off his body. He daily comes from the gym and asks if there is an increase in the size of  his biceps. You can always find juniors in his room and Chand Baba unhe funde pelte hue. We had some great outing  sessions which I can never forget. He always keeps on pointing out my mistakes and trying to rectify them by teaching  me things. I simply love it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>4th year<br>This year saw a lot of booze outings with him. Whenever I drink too much and loose my control, I just abuse him and go on abusing him till I get exhausted. But for the past some outings, this abusing has transformed into praising <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Earlier I used to tease him with name of some girls until one night when he just got mad and became so angry that literally phat gayi thi meri. That day onwards I never teased him for that, but got some other topics to <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is the  one who is always there to help out people, specially his friends. You can always count on him. He never thinks bad for anyone not even his enemy. When it comes to boozing, he just transforms into a monster or something like that. Master of bottoms up, one cannot even drink water at that speed, at which he drinks beer. Bond at smoking. Actually he taught me how to smoke (though I quit smoking sometime back <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). He has some really wild fantasies <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (I'm goin to be kicked for telling this). He uses my mobile balance more than I and it's a record that whenever I have asked him for his mobile, it did not have balance. I share  some very emotional memories with him (last Club8 outing being the most) which I cannot forget ever. His one more talent was recognized recently of going blank every now and then. Even Dipti mam noticed this in a class. One more thing, he always knows something about everything. He can be considered as a mobile Wikipedia <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Very  good at finishing his assignments and projects and presenting them. Midterms mein lagwaega aur end sem phod ke aa jaaega (that is what he claims <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ).<br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>are yaar ye word se kuch panga aa gaya ... baaki post hi nahin ho rahe <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>sorry some mistake ... other parts will be posted soon.....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I just want to tell, you are one of my best buddies and I'm sure I'll miss you the most after college <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. He has  been posted in Bangalore and it was quite saddening when I heard this <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But nothing can be done  about that and I wish him all the luck for his new life.<br><br>This asshole never speaks his heart out how hard you try to make him speak. I just want to say never forget me and  please be in touch .. always. <br><br>My <b>most memorable moment</b> with him would be the numerous Club8 outings and among those the most recent one would be the  most memorable.<br><br>I don't know y but I can feel some tears rolling down through my cheek. This may be because of the happiness brought to  me by all the memories I remembered while writing this testimonial or may be because of the grief and fear of departing  from him. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Best of luck. God bless you. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It was a tough decision to decide who will get my first testimonial and i thought what would be better than writing it for someone who was my first friend in IIIT - my first ever room-mate - Raman jain or more popularly known as RR <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is quite dumb in the sense that he says whatever comes to his mind without looking at the possible reactions he would get and later regret for his mistakes. A good singer, very innocent, body builder <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and a TT player. One of the laziest guyz one can find, favourite victim of Khatri and Pagare who bully him regularly.<br>He has got a unique way of expressing reactions by going expressionless (read blank) time to time. You ask him something, he goes blank. Uski maaro, again he goes blank. He takes 30 mins in brushing his teeth (all in vain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br>When I look back now, I believe myself to be very lucky to have him as my room partner because he also suffers from keep-the-room-clean syndrome like me. If I would have to shared my room with someone else, first two years in the college would have been my toughest years because I cannot live in an untidy room. We both belong to Rajasthan, studied at the same coaching institute, same branch. So these all added advantages made my life so easy in the initial days of college as this was the first time when I came out of my hometown. We didn't talk too much when we were room-mates as I was very silent type of a person earlier but still we shared a strong bond.<br>I think a friendship is weak and incomplete without fights among friends. When you overcome such scenarios, your friendship develops a much stronger bond as earlier. And I feel that is what happened to us because we have had our share of fightings (one can say more than that) and after all that it seems to me that our friendship will reach greater heights now.<br>Dost just think for a sec before you speak something about someone else because you might hurt their feelings. <br>Best of luck 4 ur MS <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... may you get out of IIIT bef0re 2011 <img src=Smileys/24.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
