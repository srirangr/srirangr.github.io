<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If my life in college has been a roller coaster ride, he has been my seat belt. If my life through these four years is a photograph, he is the light. If my life in IIIT-H is a cake then he would be the cherry on top of it. We are brothers in arms. We have been together since our first years. We shared the same PC in workspace. We used to sit next to each other in classes. In first two years we were in different hostels but in the latter two we were in the same. Though we shared a great bond in first two years. It is the second half of college life with him that I would cherish forever. A lot has already been said about him and I see no point in wasting characters to say all those things again. You know when you see a mirror and you think that you know yourself very well. Thats how he is to me. I see him and I know his mood. I think the time we have spent together gave us powers to recognise even the hidden feelings that we would otherwise hide from everyone else. I just want you to know that the moments spent with you have been great and wonderful. I wish that we be in the same city and always be together as we have been. After all, we are brothers in arms.<br>May God shower you with choicest of his blessings.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Meet G P Deepti, the girl who has it all. One hell of a girl she is. I am yet to find a girl as witty as her. Her dedication and zeal towards her work can inspire laziest of the being. She is a chatterbox and always full of fun. Loves reading books and has a great taste for music. She is almost always involved in more than one work, and that means she is well too good at multitasking. She has a lovely heart which cannot see her friends in distress and would do whatever it takes to put a smile on their faces. And it doesnt stop here, her initiative to work for a social cause which gave birth to Samvedana is, I am sure, going to be a milestone in her life and will touch (up) many others. She involves her heart and soul in whatever she does. She likes to be tough on the outside, but she actually is very gentle from inside. She says that she is not sentimental but the ones close to her wont agree with it. This is about the girl I know best in IIIT and I cant help praising her for her awesomeness.<br>Now lets go back in time and see how we met. It was second or third semester, I recall we met in front of GH. I dont know how we met but I am glad we did. We had hardly talked to each other and even when we did we were in groups. She talked to me very freely and I listened to her intently. I think I gave her some advice, at which I must confess I am not very good, and I hope she found it useful. From then on we have tried to retain our friendship through the thick and things that we have been through. Sometimes she couldnt help and sometimes I screwed it up very badly. And now I am so glad that we managed to get through all of it. I still remember the feeling when she gave me a coffee cup on my birthday. I love coffee cups and I love birthday presents. Apparently I had mentioned to her that I like coffee cups and she remembered it. That was very sweet of you. I did or didnt do a few things that I shouldn't or should have done. I am still amazed how could she forgive me for all those stupidity so easily.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I hope that our friendship wont see a dead end after college days, but I cant help fearing so. <br>I wish you all the luck and want you to know that I am there for you whenever you want me. <br>Please be in touch. May God bless you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Dedicated. Passionate. Hard working. Focussed. Determined. Intelligent. Fun loving. Impulsive. Sublime.<br>These are only a "few" adjectives that come to my mind which very aptly describe him. Though he can be a pain in the ass at times <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, a little annoying but otherwise he is fun to be with. I hardly knew him in first two years. In third year we shared the same wing. I got to know him little bit everytime we had a chat. He has accumulated a lot of knowledge on a lot of different topics, from politics to history, from science to movies, from wrestling to cricket. Its fun to discuss with him on all these topics. I remember discussing about different topics with him. <br>His dedication towards his work is the first thing people close to him will tell you. It's like he knows and has planned his future. He will go at length to make sure he achieve his goals. I know that it needs a lot of sacrifice. I have seen him working his ass off, sleeping only for a few hours in two-three days <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I sincerely hope you achieve whatever it is that you want. In a short span of four years, he has managed to do a lot of things that others can only dream of. He has a few research papers to his credit and some are still in process. He also grabbed a fellowship from GE.<br>All in all, I am gonna miss you buddy. I wish to see you, ten years down the line, guiding the computer technology world or whatever you choose your field as. Will miss you, all the best to you. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Aditya means Sun. I was trying to relate it to his character. Let me take a try. Hmmm.<br>Sun is the source of light, Aditya is the source of knowledge. Sun might be decaying bit by bit, but his knowledge is only increasing day by day. Hey I got it alright. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I take this opportunity to thank Lord of Alcohols for scripting that fortune moment when we got talking after both of us were completely out. We talked and we talked some serious personal stuff that day. We knew each other, merely as acquintances. But after that chat we had, we knew we could be good friends. We had a chemistry. <br>He worships Microsoft daily. And I think he carries a passport size photo of Bill Gates in his wallet <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. The guy is crazy about MS products. And the hate for Apple products is very obvious here. But I think I have managed to help that fade a little. His fondness for cars is well known, he is a gadget freak. He gets into details of everything he lay his hands on. I mean he will see every option and controls available on the device, and before you know he would have already analayzed it. I share some of his passions and have learnt a lot from him. My knowledge was very superficial, it is even now, and I am still learning and he is always there. <br>I have very wonderful memories with him. The first one is obviously that chat, then the the walk we had in Goa where we went to a different shack. The girls there were amazing <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Then the numerous chat sessions and the long walks in and around the campus. The bike trips that we have had were amazing and I hope this wont end here. Still a lot of places to be seen and explored. There is one very good thing with him, whenever I say lets go to so and so place, he is almost always ready. Even if he is not ready, I convince him a little and there we go. I simply love his company. I have shared a lot of deep and dark secrets with him and I sincerely hope that he will keep them intact <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Time is the best teacher, he has changed a lot from what he was in first year. He has also become more confident of himself. He likes to take control of the situation. The spirit that he has shown in working during placement is commendable. Just like me, he suck when it comes to girls. He had a few very good chances but he screwed up big time. <br>I sincerely hope that we be together after college. God is great and our frienship is even better. Thanks for everything. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If I have to describe this gem of a person in a few words, what would those words be. Hmmm.<br>Hard working, confused and one hell of an artist. I think this would do justice to Vatasal I know.<br>I was relieved a bit when I saw him sitting in room 119 on first day of my college. A familiar face <br>in an unfamiliar situations always does that you. We hardly interacted in NBH. But when we came to OBH <br>we had fun talking to each other. I got to know more about him. And even now I am not sure how does <br>he manage to have so many female friends with that body <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, it might be a shocking revelation for a few <br>people. Just kidding mate. <br>His dedication and commitment is an inspiration to people around him. His art <br>is creative and distinct with his own touch. He is a real gentleman. <br>He is very fond of watching movies and reading novels. I have, at so many times, borrowed books and his <br>hard disk from him. Quite a taste, I would say. He is one person fun to be with, but only if you know him.<br>For people who dont know him, his first reaction could be repelling.<br>All I want to say to you my friend is that, though I am not the person who is good at giving advice, feel <br>confident in what you do. Because the things that you do are really great and you should believe in them.<br>God be with you. May you bath in happiness and spread cheer around. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Lets start from the beginning. First day of my college, I come to cellar and in my room. Two rooms next to me there are two people from Delhi. One is tall, dark, handsome and a little shabby. The other one, well we will talk about him in his testi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In first meeting, you cant help but notice the clarity with which he utters every word. Everything he says are measured and moulded by his strong thoughts and experiences engraved in the pages of his life.<br>If its been fantastic four years, its mostly because of his friendship with me. He has been there to listen to my thoughts, to take away my sorrows, to support me in moments of doubts. While my self-confident through out the four years was a sinosuidal graph, he always believed in me and has made me believe that I am no less. I remember the treat that he gave me in canteen because he heard that I got max marks in some subject, which I didnt get of course <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He was happy for me and I was happy that I have such a friend. Thats the best treat I have had and no other can come even close to it. <br>I cant recount here the various discussions we have had on the topics ranging from personal matters to philosophical and from political to social. One thing that defines him is his strong belief in whatever he believes. He is an avid reader. The thoughts that he has extracted from his readings and his experiences shaped him into what he is today. He doesnt get affected by someone's views easily. You have to covince him and even then he would have a doubt in a corner of his mind. He will think it over and over and test it before he is actually convinced of the idea. Thats how strong his character is. <br>He holds a very special place for his close friends and would go to any lengths to make sure that his friends are happy and safe. And the feelings are reciprocated by his friends. If you ask his friends about him they wont stop praising him and then they will tell you about his gluttony <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He manages to impress anyone in the first meeting itself. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Even if you are a superstar he will shift the limelight towards himself, effortlessly.<br>I cant thank you enough for the moral support that you have given me and I take pride in having a friend in you. Be the way you are and success will want to be with you. <br>May God bless you and may our friendship grow by the minute.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>As soon as he enters the room, there is anticipation in everyone's mind. Any moment now, a few words would be uttered from his mouth, which would in all possibility succeed in leofying someone. As a byproduct there will be outbreak of laughter around him and henceforth everyone will watch there words. Because anyone of them could be the next target. No one has ever tried to leofy him, even if someone tried, they fell into their own dig. Such is the charisma of his character. Hail the unconquered, the king of all good times, the one and only - Chirag. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Phew. The above few lines about him came quite naturally. And I think I have done justice in portraying his character or that part of his character, at least.<br>For last two years he has been my wingmate, before that our interaction was quite feeble except on the basketball court. I remember and cherish all the BC sessions that took place in our wing. He has always been an entertainer, phrasing his valuable words very carefully, not to waste a syllable. I think I have said enough about it already. <br>If I were to admire someone for his determination, self-confidence and hard-work(notice the AND operator here), this guy would be on top of that list. I have seen him preparing for CAT exams. Although fate didnt favor him this time, I am sure it wont escape the next time.<br>He likes to be in his own little world and that would be his room and his laptop <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, well most of the times. He manages to remains composed in most of the situations unless someone is trying to pull his leg. In fact the reaction that he gives when someone is pulling his leg changes him into an entirely new person. But I wont be the judge. <br>He also has a fetish for doing heroic things, dude thats my stuff <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. I mean who wants to jump off a two storeyed building; he is always running his fingers through his hair, setting them in place; has recently developed an all new style of walking (arms stretched sideways at 45 degrees to horizontal and legs slightly more parted than they should be).</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>All said and done, I would like to give you a piece of advice. Be more outgoing, dynamic you are, show that to the world. Start taking the lead. I think that's what you lack. I wish all the very best for your life ahead, I might not be with you but I would only be a call apart. And of course I wouldnt need to call you, you can hear me where ever you are <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>God bless you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes he is a "Ball of laughter" and other times he is truly frustrated and crying like a baby girl either because of assignments or exams or because some prof X's leg is way up in his ass <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. When he is not in one of the two moods I mentioned above he is a sentimental fool <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br>Jokes apart, wo kisi ne kuch kaha tha naa, haan yaad aaya - "bhai banda heera hai heera".<br>We have been roommates for a whole year in our second year and wingmates in fourth year. I have been one of the constant sources of his frustration. Whenever I go to his room, I invariably pick stuff and drop them here and there in his room and sometimes even out of the room. You should see him then, going red with anger. But thats not enough to stop me <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Whenever I feel low or lonely or mischievous, he is the victim <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>"Nigam Brothers" thats what people call us when they see us together, and I cant stop grinning. I assume there is an unsaid bond of brotherhood between us that exists. Most of you may not know but he is very very religious, I mean who goes to a temple on his first date <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Anytime he is in trouble or he is very happy he remembers his God. Most of us, including me, remember God only when we are in deep shit. But this guy can frustrate even mightiest of God. <br>Coming to special powers that he has, he can irritate the shit out of any living or dead man. His not so special powers, he is darn good at sketching and ranks just below me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. His sense of humor can sometimes be very fatal to your belly muscles. He has a very upgraded version of brain, thats going to release only after a few centuries ahead of our times. He can very effectively use his body to knock the shit out of you. <br>When I think of penning down some fav memories, my mind is flooded with loads of them and its hard to pick. I will write some of them, anyway.<br>-> night outs during felicity '08<br>-> watching movies in NBH C-13, like a walk to rem, pulp fiction, twelve monkeys etc<br>-> bike trip on patancheru highway<br>-> uncountable walks to coffee shop and around the campus</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>-> ... and still going<br>Cheers to our friendship <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Raman Rox is what RR should stand for, but it doesnt <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We have wingmates throughout our college life. We very often go to each others room just to irritate each other or to take an advice on which movie should I see <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. If you ask me I would say he is a very funny guy, but in his very own distinctive style. He has this ability to lighten up the situation at darkest of hours, though he does it unknowingly <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>I dont know how but somehow we have tried to keep our friendship strong even after all the differences that we have had. And that just makes it all the more special. It very often happens that we remain silent and dont talk to each other and then some time passes and we get along very well for some more time. And the cycle just keeps going on. That apart, I admire this guy from the bottom of my heart for a few of his qualities. He has upped and then maintained his confidence level even in the toughest of times. He can leofy anyone with his witty comments. But it happens so rarely anyone hardly knows about it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is always ready for the photoshoot, making weird faces and giving unnatural poses. He wants a perfect six pack but has never been to gym for more than 6 days at a time. I think he is a bit impulsive as well. Dude you have all the time, use it everytime before you speak. Its just a piece of advice.<br>I would sum up it now and like you to believe in yourself. Remain COOL and DASHING as you are. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>We met on our very first day of college. I remember it as if it was just yesterday, and yet it was a four years long day <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Abhijeet Pagare who happens to be best of my buddies is I think very sensitive and very caring. Loves dancing and listens to not only rock but almost all kind of music. His fav pass time is to hang out with his "chaddi buddy" and pull his leg or help people pull his leg <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Well he is pretty darn good at that as well, pulling legs I mean. He is one of those razor sharp kinda kids, his imaginative power can knock winds out of you. Trust me I have been the victim quite a few times. He has also done a Ph.D in giving nicknames to friends. So beware if he calls you something funny, you would be that for the rest of your life. One thing that I cant do and he can do is speaking his mind out loud, because sometimes it takes a lot of courage to do what you think is right. Its very common for people to change during college days. Our pappu is no exception to this rule. I remember very vividly that evening at canteen where he pledged that he will get a girl in next 2-3 months. We also counted the number of eligible girls in hyderabad <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Though the planned never worked out for him, but thats not the point here. He was a kid at heart back then, and now when I see him I see a much mature person. Taking decisions by striking a balance between what his mind says and what his heart speaks.  By this I does not mean that he is not the same gentle and sublime guy that he was. Just add a little self-contentness and a strong mind to that and you will begin to know him. Due to such qualities that he possess I felt I could share almost anything in this world with him. No matter how deep, dark or intimate feelings that I might have. And I have shared quite a few things with him during what I would call a very short span of time. Because I feel that I havent spend as much time with you as I want, maybe due to ill-fate of mine or circumstantial situations by which we all are gripped.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br> Being wingmates with you has been a wonderful experience and I learnt quite a few lessons of life from you. Thanks to you for all your support and may our friendship flourish even in toughest of times.<br>I will remember you for all your sweetness and cuteness and as a guy who is very gentle and kind at heart. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Vipul aka Rangeela Buddha aka Bahu aka ...<br><br>I must confess when I met him in first year he was a quite type of guy, but comes second year and he is all squeaky and chattery. It seemed as if GOD of leofying himself made him his private angel and bestowed him with greatest of his powers <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. This is true even now and I think Chand and many others can testify my statement. I have known him from my first year, we have been wing mates, not to forget we have shared some good moments which I can never forget.<br>We came closer in summer vacation after third year. We used to go to yuktahaar mess and on our way back we had good times at canteen drinking juice and sharing lighter moments. I dont think I can control what comes out of my mouth at all times, but I said something to him in second year, which he seemed to have taken to his heart. He never told me what it was, but I have said my apologies to him everytime he got drunk. Because that's when he will bring the topic, always <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.  From what I know he is very dedicated towards studies, the guy has already put on his research shoes and made quite a reputation for himself in LTRC lab. Good going mate, I wish you all the best and may you join us in hyd after your MS. I will always have a reserved space for you in my heart.<br>This guy has seen a lot and consequently changed a lot. From a guy who rarely spoke to a guy who can render you speechless with his wittiest answers and yes they are sometimes real nasty. A guy who never gives heed to the comments passed on him and remain composed in all circumstances or this is what it seems who knows what he is hiding. From what I recall the metamorphosis of his character happened sometime in second year, which I think was for the good.<br>As is the case that I am pretty weak in tailoring my thoughts into words, this seems a reasonably short testimonial for such a good friend but neverthless I will be there for you dude, writing testimonials to you. My heartiest wishes for you buddy, may you succeed in all your endeavours.<br>Peace. </b></i></ul><br><br>
