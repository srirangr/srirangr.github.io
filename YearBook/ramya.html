<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ramya - Another girl, the other being Sushma,  with many nick names with the most famous being Tiger Ramda (courtesy Harshita) and few others being rammi, rammiboy, etc <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is the googly gal of our batch. And she totally deserves it. She is the most studious girl of our batch. Until and unless she finishes all assts and projects as soon as they are given can she sleep or even breathe peacefully <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> In doing this, she has an amazing stamina - well...it is not an easy job to become Kirti Garg's (of all ppl) pet rt? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Chicken, pizzas and thumsup are her fav, or shud I say, regular diet <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In these past 4 years only once did I see this girl drink a fruit juice and that happened just about 2 weeks back I guess <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She is a total sport and is always ready to go out at any point of time and more importantly she has an "awesome" sense of humor <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Her grip over Telugu lang, mainly on samethalu, is second to none <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> All the best for your job Rammi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vivekprakash.html>Vivek Prakash</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>hmm ... Ramya ... I know this girl for the last two years and is now one of my good friends ... very brainy and studious ... very hard working when it comes to studies ...<br><br>Very supportive ... does every work with dedication ... still remember ITWS 2 evaluations when she was the only one who sat the whole time and evaluated the copies and lab exams<br><br>All the best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> have a wonderful life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Here is Miss. "Google"an <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is an epitome of hardwork. I bet no one can dedicate themselves to work like she does. Getting up at around 2 or 3 A.M, not sleeping for days are some stuff that shows how determined she is. Also, she never hesitates to help anyone who comes to her asking some doubts.<br><br>She is also good at doing Drama. One of our professor addresses her as "MLA Ramya", for she performed the role of an MLA in a skit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Also good at Carroms too.<br><br>All the very best Rammi da <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Do Wonders at Google <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>well..this girl over her is quite dedicated to her work....I was quite amazed how one can work so hard for acads...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />...But her hard work has paid off...her cgpa..her google intern...her google job...and is writing a research paper <img src=Smileys/77.gif />...<br>I remember when we used to make noise in the corridor <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> and she used to study ...she used to be so angry on us <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>But has a thorough knowledge of all the courses she has taken..and loves watching Telugu Movies <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ramya - one of the most hardworking,sincere and intelligent girls of our batch. I did not interact much with her in the first two years but have got to know her better over this past year and she is a very unique person in her own right. Whenever I go to her with any doubt she always helps me out with it and has never said no <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Her dedication to acads is unparalleled <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and congratulations on getting into Google. You deserved it. She has awesome knowledge about telugu songs and she along with Anu,KD and Harshi have won antakshari many times. She is a food freak too and inspite of that how she manages to stay so thin is beyond my belief <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br>        Wishing you all the best for your future and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Co SE TA. A very helpful girl. Almost entire batch has only one kind of opinion about her that is <b> kasi</b> after all she is a Goo'gal' <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . Her basic instincts of hardwork and discipline should ensure that she remains successful throughout her life. All the best</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I call her "Rammi".....Well..Everyone knows the fact that she works really really hard, and she got placed in awesome company (Infact her dream company from day 1 in IIIT).Very Very ambitious...Was my btp, honours,computer vision and SE partner..She is my better half when it comes to acads <img src=Smileys/10.gif />..she makes me work like hell and always reminds me of the consequences of being lazy and careless.I am always the first one to pull her leg and she is always the first one to debug others codes..and god alone knows from where she mustered all this patience...to bear with me through all these years..Thanks a lot rammi boy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> sth many people donno about her..will never say a no..when asked for a movie or restaurant or window shopping or whatever...a pizza maniac (Dominos is very lucky..), A movie Freak (watched almost all telugu ( Esp old one's) in dc++) (a good advisor..advises u very well ..I remember the time she spent around 4 hrs...jus listening to my crap and am really thankful to u...for being with me through all the tough times..A person on whom u can rely...and all in all..a wonderful helping person she is...Well she is romantic at heart and most importantly very photogenic (Jus Ask her the number of compliments she received on her pics..),pretty famous in the campus for her awwwwwwwwwwwesome pace when she walks (runs) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.Finally Ramya I would like to end this testi saying a big "THANK YOU" for everything...and "SORRY" for few bad times when I hurt u knowingly or unknowingly.

<b><a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ramya is ideally that one girl whom every mother and father would like to parent[ stands top in class], whom everyone would like to befriend[very caring and understanding] and whom everyone would like to bug[ Always smiles back but never retorts]. Beneath a "kasi" shell, she is  a romantic person and has a sweet story which she keeps telling us daily. Has a "sametha" on her lips for every damn situation. Sweetly termed as "Kasi devatha" of our batch, Ramya shares the honour of first girl-GOOGLE-ian of IIITH. <br>("Oorike vastara mahanubhavulu"?).I owe my C++ to her, for she literally nurtured me with every single concept with lots of patience. Cannot forget those wonderful times when we travelled to VJA together[We stood for the whole 6-hr journey once!]. One of my best friends whom I'm really proud of and Sorry if I ever hurt you dear! Please keep in touch because I never want to lose you.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
