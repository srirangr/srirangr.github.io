<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Khadebal <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ...<br><br>In short ... he is an intelligent , witty , fun loving and moody guy. Some times very friendly n loses his temper in seconds... <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.... <br><br>All the best for ur future ... keep in touch.<br>Good luck for ur PHD ... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I call him Sigmund, you know, of the Freud kind.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>English courses and the blogosphere, that's why we interacted the most. Stumps everyone with his command of English. There are several facets of his well-honed personality.<br><br>Does what he likes, knows what he wants and has the ability to pull it off. The decision to go for the PhD in Psychology after B.Tech. sums it all up.<br><br>Comes across as one with a devil-may-care, no-nonsense attitude, but we all know that beneath that, he's just like any of us.<br><br>All the bestfor your future Geekay. And as we discussed earlier, if and when you do achieve something in life, you won't be the only person in the batch to be proud of that. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met him on my first morning in IIIT-H. Being Army kids, we hit off well, but being totally different personalities, we lacked the compatibility. Then came third year and I got a chance to know GeeKay better.<br>I still remember bothering him to teach me concepts of Algorithms when he strictly refused everyone. He did help me with some parts of the syllabus but explained me his reason for not helping others in academics, which I totally<br>understand and respect.<br>I had good time eating Chinese with him, Rahul and Dandu and because of this I started having soup. We also share common liking for gravy chicken and army life.<br>My interest in music grew because of him, when one day he asked me what kind of music I like and gave me songs of Lifehouse and Switchfoot which are my favorites.<br>He's a BIG fan of Rorschach (I hope that's the spelling!), and named his blog as Rorschach's Journal. Also he has a lovely sense of humor. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Although he's moody and rude at times, (I don't even think of knocking at his door at these times!) he is totally awesome during other times. He's an allrounder, with great insight about things, a sharp mind and self discipline (which includes brushing at night, because of him I resumed this habit of mine, otherwise I'd have lost all my gums by now). He has tried to, a lot of times, help me out of my confusion about some things in life and it has helped me a lot. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I enjoyed my third year a lot being your wingman. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his observational skills, self-discipline and ability to be honest to himself.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Movie and Music freak:<br>	Kharkwal is a music freak to the core ... has a collection of english songs well over any other personal collection of music by anyone in our batch. He has a huge knowledge of music.Once he gets addicted to one track you can listen to that music playing in his laptop till he finds some other addictive track.<br>	He has a real weird taste for Movies ... I guess all recommendation systems would fail on this guy (that includes the Legendary 'Muglu's system'). He may sometimes like the worst possible movie and sometimes hate one of the best movies of a specific genre. He is one of the very few in our batch who doesnt watch a English TV Show in college.<br><br>Passion for Games:<br>	Kharkwal is the only true gamer besides me in our batch. We read on latest news on games to come in the future ... the previews, hands on etc. A true Fifa fan (has all versions of FIFA with him) and God knows how many times he has completed Prince of Persia (all 3 3D Version of the game).<br><br>And now that you are heading to New Jersey for a PhD Psychology in Rutgers University try to stay in touch online [I will always be online as usual]. Wishing u all the best for ur future studies and future itself as a whole .... signing off ... Kiran D.<br><br>I may write another testi but all depends on time.  <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is the first batchmate that I had met in IIIT and he was alloted a room right next to mine. We were friends right from first year, we had fought a few times but we remained very good friends throughout these 4 years.<br><br>A few things worth mentioning about him are:<br>Excellence at Acad work:<br>	I need not tell much about it but what people dont know is how fast he does all the background work needed for an assignment, project, presentation, exams. He is capable of reading a specific topic to a very deep level within 1 day without even getting frustrated. He also has good knowledge of medicine and biology which happens to be his second choice after computers.<br><br>	We all know he does his work but you should see his coding skills ... he can make quality code in no time. <br><br>Food Junkie:<br>	The only true non-veg fan in my friend circle and hence we share food on most occasions. He has an appettite for good quality food and hence never backs down when comes to the cost. I and Kharkwal may well be the people who have gone out maximum number of times for having food outside IIIT (The only competition might be Ankit Saraswat <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br>	It is with him that I went to Barista, CCD, and Subway for the first time.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>His name itself tells one of his greatest qualities, GK, is an epitome of knowledge and dedication. In the initial years, I only heard about him like there is a guy who is very punctual and passionate about studies and used to finish all the assignments well in time. I never interacted with him because I felt he might be very proudy and arrogant. I also heard that many girls had a crush on him in the first year and this also carries on till date.<br><br>I actually came to know more about him when he did CL-2 with me and there I recognized him as the most sincere and studious guy in the class. He had more knowledge than many of the LTRC students though he himself had no relation with LTRC and language processing. Then I became his tutor in CL-1 and his script was among the first ones which I corrected. This could be because I felt his answers to be most precise and to the point and I had some sort of confident in his answers that if Gaurav has written this, it must be correct. And the main thing is he never proved my feeling wrong. Even Dipti ma'am is his big fan and she has admired him so many times in front of me.<br><br>Then we took a course comprising of 4 students and 3 faculty members. The 4 students being Gaurav, I, Chand and Himank. Here also he always remained in the limelight because of his knowledge and dedication. He completes his assignments well on time and this sometimes pissed me off <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. Usually it happened that when he submitted the assignment, I actually started doing that.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Coming to his other qualities, he is an excellent bb player and his english is among the best around the college. When he comes to doing BC, noone can beat him and this side became visible to me only during the Felicity'08. There are so many things to be learnt from him and I always try to be as much sincere as he is but never reach even upto a little level than his.<br><br>He has his priorities well defined and this makes him different from the mass. He has apllied for higher studies outside and I hope he'll get admitted to some very good college because he is the most deserving gyuz in our batch. i'm quite sure that after a few years he'll be somewhere where many of us dreamt of to be.<br><br>Good luck to you and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Kharkwal</b><br><br>For the first 7 semesters of my B.Tech, just knew this guy but rarely interacted with him. He had a reputation of being moody and since our paths never crossed much, so never got the chance to talk to him. Back then knew him as a person, who is fodu in acads, sincere and dedicated towards studies, awesome bb player, one of the smartest guys of the batch ( on whom almost evry girl had a crush), superb english. Basically a talent house. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And then came 8th sem and the IDL course aka pain in ass, where we were partners in misery. The course has just 4 students him,chand, vipul and me; this is when I started interacting with him, and that's when I realised that this guy is fun to be with. Another facet of his character come to the fore in this year Felicity. I have always seen him as a cultured and sophisticated guy but thats when I came to know ki jab ye machane pe ata hai to he is second to none. At times when he comes to his full form, people just stand back and appreciate him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Coming back to IDL course,its been so great fun having him in the same class, he has made bearing this course a little easy. I have been quite frustrated with the course and at times it has been hell but if you could pick up the guy who has been frustrated most with the course, its gotta be him. Frequently after the class, there would be a heated outburst by him against the profs of the course, that would be hilarious. The best one was when he was talking about  going to our dear ol' dean and complaining that they can't  make people work so hard in a HSSM <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ROFL!!<br><br>He is one hell of a guy, the guy after doing his B.Tech from CS is now going for a PhD is psychology, the first time I heard this, i was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> WTF!! Is he nuts or what <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> but well he must be knowing better, that's  all I could think of <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future man!!<br><br><b>Most memorable Moment : All the machana in 8th sem and all the frustrations we shared in IDL course</b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Gaurav is one the most sincere students of our batch and a brilliant guy. At times hard working and at the same time enjoying himself with games and other things .. I used to play basketball with him in our first year.<br>He is a cheerful guy and good at heart. All the best dude .. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirann.html>Kiran Neelisetty</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The only thing i know about gaurav is his "Quest for knowledge"..<img src=Smileys/2.gif />..I donno how he gets those many douts when the professor is teaching...Any good professor would love to teach a student like him(sincere,hardworking...)as shashank said the only word that comed to my mind when i see u is "kasi"....</b></i></ul><br><br>

All the best</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>It was fun being TA with you in CN, where we kept skipping all the work <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I also loved it when he kept asking about my CAT preps and wishing me for the same. Lots of other memories including taking the 1-2 in the elocution competition (first year), A1 english classes and the lit course, BC in workspace etc.<br><br>I'm sure you'll make it big someday. May God bless.<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Yuvraj Singh<br>Fav memory: Winning the quiz in second year.<br>Message for him: Try and be a master of your moods. </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In my first year, I came across orkut and this thing called testimonials. Writing for others, and being written about.. I found it an amazing little thing. I wished I had some for myself. I remember that it was Gaurav who wrote the first one for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And wasn't it a very nice one? I loved it back then, thanks man!<br><br>Well, the thing about Gaurav, as everyone knows, is that he can be pretty moody. Hes this bubbly, enthusiastic guy full of those one-liners one moment, and a somber, sometimes angry and irritated guy the next. This is a little unfortunate, as it does put of a lot of potential friends he could have made. But I guess hes pretty happy with what he has. For that, I think we need to understand the Army background hes come from. And the constant changing of schools, and hence pals, something which can often be very harsh on you. Just read the testimonial he wrote for Dandu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>But apart from the eccentricities, he is one of those guys who you genuinely call 'fodu'! Let me admit, that hes been a bit of an inspiration when it comes to punctuality, thinking and time management. I've had opportunities to interact with him, and hes a brilliant chap. Add to that the effort he puts in. He can be a indecisive when it comes to decision making, but I was amazed to see that hes even selected a problem statement for his Ph.D. Already! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He is also into a lot of extra curriculars, including (phodu) basketball and (awesome) lit talent. His English is the best in the batch and his quizzing skills are amazing. In fact, hes got an amazing amount of knowledge on a lot of fields, and has been a super quiz partner! I've lost the count of the number of times we've quizzed together as a team. He always takes me in, in spite of the fact that I've been screwing up the last few times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . The lit knowledge really helped in Felicity '08, where he did some fodu work in reviving the vertical. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Gaurav, a fellow Basketball player, First year only known him through Bball matches.

When I met him first time, I found him a little arrogant( poor judgement) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  and I also told Sambhav, he'll not be in our (so called) group for a long time. But, he has changed himself a lot since then <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Now he is more mature.

I had a great time during 2nd and 3rd year, i wish you were there as a friend. <br><br><b> 4th Year: </b> Hmm... 7th Sem bhi nikal gaya and hardly talked to each other, but then i don't know what happened to this guy, just after getting placed he changed himself drastically and started to be there for everyone, Nagarjuna Sagar chala, volleyball khelna regular start kar diya, continuously BC karna start kiya and suddenly i couln't find his unpredictable nature anymore, and i told you, except from his unpredictable behaviour he is one of the best guy i've ever met and once again in no time WE BECAME FRIENDS <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, GeeKay ke saath bethkar kisi ki lene main jo maza hai wo kahin nahi...khas taur par Daandu ki <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , we could spend a lot more time together but we couldn't, i am not saying it's your fault but whoever fault it was, we missed around 2 and a half year and i know will never get back. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>I wish GeeKay, in future you find many good friends and have a great time ahead and enjoy your life at its most. You are the most talented guy i've ever seen so no matter kitna bhi bad luck ho, still you'll managed to have a bright future. <br><br>PS: Shaadi par invite karna mat bhoolna.<br>PS: v4veer@gmail.com</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hey<b> KhaDAKwal,</b> <br>		Teri Testi to main dehati main hi likhoonga...pata chala ki bhawnaye samazne ki jagha english grammer ki mistake hi nikalta rah gaya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>* First of all, am not going to write a formal testimonial.<br>* I want you to call/contact me every time you read it (ofcourse after leaving this institute)<br>* I am writing my viewpoint here, so you must not take it as a general opinion.<br><br><b>1st Year:</b> We were in the same Human Value group and among first few to attend first ever shivir of Jivan Vidhya in IIIT-HACH, so ofcourse we were friends right from the kick-off. I was so impressed by his intellegence and english speaking style and most of us had the same view in the beginning. But this fellow never been in any relation (friends) for so long before coming to IIIT-HACH, so had no idea how to get going with everyone. Around after 1st sem most of us started to critisizing GeeKay for his rudeness and arogance but they didn't know that its not his fault, even i did face his unpredictable behaviour few times but i decided to stay there as his friend and wait untill he gets changed because apart from few, he is a great guy with multi talents. You know what GeeKay, i tried my best yaar but everytime you disappointed me, you were so unpredicatable ki ek pal to aapke saath haske baat kar raha hai aur next moment oothke chal diya. I realized ki Geekay ka koi achha friend hai hi nahi college main, but muze laga ki dheere dheere GeeKay sudhar jayega so once again i waited and this time GeeKay thoda sudhar gaya, he started to respect everyone and we became very good friends, at the end of first year hum itne achhe dost ho gaye the ki log oosko critisize karna band kar dete in front of me. But unfortunately GeeKay ne fir se U-turn liya aur showed his unpredicatblility and this time i couldn't stay there any longer and decided to leave him alone, he came to me and said Sorry, but i knew he wouldn't change, not soon enough. <br>			This was our first year together, many ups and downs but really  had a great time</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Gaurav is brilliant and Funny. His sense of humor is really good. Very hard working but impatient. <br>He is one of the most brilliant person of our batch. Carries a dictionary with himself always <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> !! <br>Great in academics, sports and literary activities. <br>A wonderful person to know. <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If an Indian goes abroad, and a foreigner asks him about India, he would say "Where Taj Mahal is...". Similarly, in near future, when someone would ask about IIIT-H, a reply from any Indian student would be "Where 'GEEKAY' did his graduation...yaar!!". <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>He is a disciplined, dedicated, hard-working, perseverant, and a smart guy. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is younger than me but far more knowledgeable. <img src=Smileys/26.gif />  Any one can learn a lot from this guy. I hope you would get better and better with time. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Wish you a Good Luck for your future. <br>And at the end, ..<br><br><br><br>I just wish for myself that I would complete my MS before your future plans get fulfilled. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>It's difficult to write anything about Gaurav in 3 mins. Nevertheless, I'll give it a shot. He's one of the most hardworking people i've seen. He is also very sincere and at times very funny too. He's moody and I'm sure everyone in the 'world' knows that. You can never predict when you might be at the receiving end and to tell you the truth  it has happened with me quite a few times too. He is sometimes very rude and also doesn't generally help others. But, he's a good guy ( I know people will agree with that ) and it is because of that we are friends and remain to be so for ever. I wish him all the best for his future endeavours and hope he gets married and have kids soon. <br>Arrivederci <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
