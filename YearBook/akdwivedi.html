<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>for the first 2 years I don't him much. I used to hear a lot about him. He was the man who has no music background and learned guitar after coming to iiit and currently the best in it. You are inspiring dude. If at all I learn guitar its becoz of you. <br><br>His english in the initial stages was funny but I think he worked a lot about it. I see a lot of change. Your stage peformances rock.<br><br>Your farewell participation made everyone happy. All the best in CIQ. Guess you rock there too.<br><br>Bye. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I was thinking of writing a testimonial in "your style" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but could not do justice to it so am sticking with what I know <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I knew him early on because of him being in Agni and can never ever forget that drama you guys did for our freshers. It was hilarious for all the wrong reasons <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Has been a very active member of Agni - cultural captain, very good singer and a bad dancer <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. We spoke quite often during Agni meetings and he came across as a very genuine person who really wanted to try all kinds of things , proof of which is him being in the rock band,trying out that Ghajini haircut, doing all kinds of arbit bc with me over gtalk etc etc. Of late he has become this extrovert and your monologue during one of the informal sessions(the hairstyle waala if i m not wrong <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) of farewell made me laugh real loud <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br>   Wishing you loads of luck for your future and have fun!!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Atul is the only "Always Hyper" Character I have ever met. Atul is really smart which can been seen by the fact that he has coped up with Daddu as project partners. Atul is easily irritated and used to be a victim of Scientists and My PJs. I had only few conversations with Atul before he came to IIIrd floor before that I had an impression that he is cunning (I believe all strangers will think so) but when I had conversations with him in IIIrd floor, All my opinions had shattered and I came to know that He is a really good guy with a huge sense of humour [ he cracks amazing witty jokes at times]. <br><br>This guy has a huge list of abuse words which he uses more often than anybody else. All his talent is evident in the fact that He being from a small village "Rewa" has made huge achievements in IIIT ... He was a significant member of IIIT Rock Band [He was the lead singer] and coined the name "Avant Garde" for it, He is an excellent Blind SHooter in BB, is xtremely good at studies ... hardly studies but he gets a A-,B,A for sure, shares my interest in uncleanliness <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, has a startup called Pacare along with Abhinav Parashar and thats only a few of his achievements.<br><br>Atul ... You are one of a Kind and I dont expect I will meet anyone like you in the future so will miss you. I m sorry for having called u You-Know-What.<br><br>Being fellow hyderabadis, signing off ....

<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Atul Dwivedi A.K.A. Chhadami is one of few multi-talented guys of our batch. He's very hardworking guy who will give his 100% to achieve anything that he wants. He's very good at Dholak (in fact he's the only guy I have seen playing Dholak <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), good Guitar player and a good programmer as well. Not to mention his skill at computer games like AOE/CZ/Pacman <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Being house captain of Agni, he's been integral part of most of the cultural activities in campus. He also plays good basketball and been part of his house and our batch's basketball team. Its really hard to imagine so many talents in one person but he has done it. Despite being from a background where he was offered no knowledge of computer science, he worked really hard and done well in his academics at college, and finally got a great job for himself.<br><br>He is one of my best friends at IIIT. I met him on the second day of coming to IIIT and we became friends since then. He was my neighbor at G.H.E.B. in first 2 years of college. I still remember those BC sessions that we had in G.H.E.B. in the beginning days with Kapil, Sainani, Mathur, Rahul Jain. Those days of ragging. He was reallly good at various courses and he taught me almost every course before the exams in first year and second year. After that I stopped bothering even to study one day before the exam <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Most of the whatever marks I got during those days are due to his help. I owe him one for that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. After that came the holidays after first year, when we became really good friends as we both had stayed at campus during those times. I still remember those days when we had pretty much no work and used to BC all days, eat food in canteen and have lots of fun. I also remember the CZ games I played with him, there was a time when he sucked so much at the game, but has improved a lot now <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>I know you will make a mark in whatever field you touch. Just dont forget your college friends. Be in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Atul aka Atal aka Chhaddami.The real cool DUDE of our batch. This multi-talented chap from Rewa is an awesome guitar player (founder of Avant Garde - IIIT rock band), phodu tabla player <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, quite good at basketball and most importantly BC. Bhai bande ne bakar mein Ph.D kari hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Has crossed all limits of BC in this sem and one can find his expert comments almost everywhere, be it in yearbook'09, BC forum, orkut photo albums or ug4 mailing list. <br><br>One of the most memorable moments with him is the batch trip of 2nd year when we composed some awesome vulgar songs and formed the P-band <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. His unique style of playing guitar really made that trip a lot more fun. I enjoy teasing this guy a lot especially on the Chhaddami thing <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and seeing is reaction to that makes it all the more interesting. <br><br>We became friends after the evening basketball sessions in 2nd year. Was one of my first basketball buddies. He really learnt the game quite quickly and is now  one of the best among the batch in this game.  Lots of memories to link with him while playing basketball like - all those small fights over fouls and apologizing each other at the end of play, leofying Bajaj when he is on the losing side <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, his rough style of attacking when he has the ball and not caring a bit about the opponents <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, infinite BC during and after the matches and many more (jo abhi yaad nahi aa rahi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>All in all banda ye bindaas hai. All he best for your future buddy. God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Aur haan abhi-abhi pata chala hai ki bande ko ishq ho gaya hai . To ab hum yahi dua karte hai ki is Chaddami ki aloo chat jaldi se pak jaaye <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

CS bhi khelta hai .... aur sabse badi baat, itna bada bcbaaz hai. Orkut par kuch bhi photo aaye, kisi ki bhi photo aaye, Atal bhai ke comments us par zaroor milenge. BC forum par PJ section mein to kya hi BC ki thi inhone. Aur aajkal to khud ki p**n stories bana kar logon ko sunate hain. Jab isne pehli baar mujhe sunai to meri hasi hi control nahi ho rahi thi.

Atul, Kapil, Somani and I used to discuss each and every ragging incident back then. Even in those initial days, one could easily observe the simplicity and enthusiasm with which he carried himself. However, not many would have bet on Atul to become what he is today....the best all-rounder of our batch. <br>Although I am not an avid writer, like many others, I have my own style of writing, and all other testimonials that I write shall comply with it. <br>par atal ke liye to bhai k style mein hi likhna chahiye....kyun bhai?!?<br>Atul Dwivedi aka Atal aka Atal <b>Cock</b> aka DVD aka Chhadaami aka Rock aka Avant Ga*** <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>atal sahab ki jitni taareef ki jaaye utni kam hai. matlab, banda ekdum cheeta kism ka hai. shuru shuru mein main isey ek kitaabi keeda samjha karta tha, but ye banda mast nikla. padhai ke saath duniya bhar ki extra-curricular activities ki hain isne college mein....aur uske baad sabmein phoda hai. basketball bhi khelta hai bhai but maine isey kabhi bhi jeette hue nahin dekha bb mein <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>aur by jove, CS to kya khelta hai banda...matlab kamaal hi hai bas.

Hats off to you dude. He is real nice person at heart who never lets his friends down. In fact, friends revel in his company and are most amazed by his uncanny knack of coming up with quick-witted responses. Truly hilarious are they <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>This guy also has an attitude made of steel which came to the fore during placements.

<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is a guy that has learnt many new things in the college. We used to live in GHEB together. I remember his learning Guitar. I used to go to his room and listen to guitar sometimes. He refined his skills and became an indispensable part of Music club(later co-ordinator of the Music Club). He knew Tabla even before coming to IIIT and he played that during the visit of President APJ <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is the co-founder of IIIT's rock band Avant-garde(did I spell it right?). He also sings  and I really relished the song "Dooba-dooba" sang by you in 119. All in all I can say that if there is an award of "Musical discovery of IIIt" it would go to DVD(that is some of us call him) this year.<br>He is good in Maths and technical. I remember his tutorial session during exams in his room. Once we had this Maths-II end sem and we studied together in my room. We studied all night long and slept at dawn. That was one memorable experience.<br>He is simple by heart and slightly less self confident. This things makes him vulnerable to bad habits. Dude you are very good and very talented.

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Atul aka Aatulraa aka DVD aka Chhadami aka Dwivedi Babu</u><br><br>Dwivedi ji is my oldest friend in IIIT, our friendship predates our life in IIIT by almost a year. I still remember the first day I came to Bansal classes and sat besides this guy, who had scored spectacularly in the maths test conducted a few days ago. Needless to say I was quite impressed with his performance, we became quite good friends but then he moved on to one of the top section on the basis of his performance and I was left languishing in one of the lowly placed ones. One of the memories I have from Kota time is of a FIITJEE open test when he missed the first scheduled test which was maths and to my horror, the guy started solving that particular paper on his jeans. He also had things like <b>"Study rotation today"</b> written, Crazy and dedicated were the words I had for him that day.<br><br>Then cometh IIIT life and his life here can be divided into two major phases, one phase stretching the first 7 semesters when he was a guy who played <b>instruments quite well, sang nicely, was quite good at academics, was a member of the batch BB team, an active member of agni house and the Cultural Captain of the house</b>. He was a nice friend of mine even back then, it was always a joy talking to him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> A nice person who was quite funny and entertaining, always enjoyed the sessions when he would play guitar or tabla.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br>Then came 8th semester and the guy went bonkers, I still cant understand what has happened to him, he seems to have gone out of his mind. These days he is a completely changed person a person who woul leave you ROFLing everytime you start talking to him. He has always had that accent which led him to sing <b>"Kalifornicasion" </b>but these days whenever he opens his mouth, the words seem to be coming from the mouth of a person who has been living in a village and not in the big city of hyderabad. Its been such a delight spending time with him these days.. Just too funny and specially the testimonials he writes. He is the limit of BC. <br><br>Have always been a fan of this guy for the way he has shaped up over the years in IIIT. From being a kid from the small town of Reeva who wasnt too aware of the ways of world in a big city, who wasnt too good when it came to speaking English and yet I remember that this guy had enough conifdence in him to overshadow all these cons. I still remember once in the beginning of 1st year, he went on to stage (don't  remember the occasion, it happened in Motorola) he went on to stage and he meant to say something like "I wannna be the best singer" and instead said "I am the best singer"(or something of that sort). The entire class was laughing and yet thi guy was completely unflustered, not even an inkling of frustration on the face of this guy. Will always admire and respect you for the confidence you have in your abilities and gotta say its not unfounded. You have the substance to have this belief. I personally feel that you are amongst the very few people on our batch who can achieve anything they set their eyes on.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

He loves playing instruments, and has been very active in all the cultural events in the campus.

Add to it his acads and the spirit of entrepreneurship and you have one of the best but an inconspicuous all rounder.

<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first thing i remember about Atul is his chemistry with Sainani during their stay at GHEB. I used to stay in the adjacent room. Ek taraf the most mildest of the voices(the annoying one) and on the other side vibrations of guitar strings and the famous BKL,MC,BC and all <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Anyone would get interested to see what was cooking. In the most messy of the rooms I and you used to tease Sainani about his Ahmedabad crush remember <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  .<br><br>Jokes apart he is a singer, guitarist and also a budding entrepreneur.

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Atul, probably best all rounder of our batch. No one has been so expert in various field like him. Right from cultural's performances to basketball matches to playing games to academics <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He not touched these fields, he left a mark there. Been expert in most of the things he does. Have started a Band here in IIIT, not only that, he had been lead singer of that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />  Still he is down to earth and never show off how exceptional he is<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>	From first year of nerdiness, for me he has grown to a bro to me. Initial year we were not that close, anyway a "hi" here and there and we discuss about my hometown. How he lived there and got beaten by some teacher <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />. In second year we watched a movie "Sixth Sense" and even after completion of movie, he was like "Kya hua movie mein" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> We came together when he shifted to 3rd floor. He was always part of outing with us. He is thorough entertainer and had great sense of humour <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Always makes you laugh with small (sometime very very cheap) jokes and actions he does. Sometimes tells you his tales(make up of his mind) of daddu,paro etc. and the way he tells it in his bagheli accent is worth listening. 6th sem, he was my project partner in WDKM, we tried hard for getiing code for that one but he ended up coding by himself <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Summer'08 ki ending mein we started playing AOE, We played many nights shouting "Gold de, Mayans bhej etc etc..". Bahut mazza aata tha. He plays like PRO in AOE with mayans civilization <img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/1.gif />Ladka is chotte gaon ka stud <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> hain. Pta nahin kitni ladkiyan isse milna chahti hain aur baatein karti hain. Always have some girl bugging him and he always want us to leave him alone at the moment<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One thing I respect him for is his perseverance, he keeps on trying things till he masters it <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His chill attitude and cool nature is the reason of him having so many friends.

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II:<br>I remember three instances when he didn't look back and that's what made a difference.<br>First is when he decided to learn guitar in second sem. He joined guitar classes in summers and practiced everyday (main usse practice karte hue dekhke thak jaata tha, par wo nahi thakta tha). He later decided to start a new IIIT rock band when he came in contact with other talented guys. I had my doubts but he didn't have any of his. I witnessed the result of consistent hard work and perseverence on the rock show night when he performed with his rock band in front of felicity crowd. Second instance was basketball. All he did was play the game everyday and now he's so good at it that he blindly shoots and<br>the ball goes through the basket. Third instance was his attempt to launch a startup. I was a part of the venture initially but dropped later. Atul worked hard at it and finally launched his own startup, although it still needs to be used! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He sometimes regrets that his academic achievements have not been much. Once when he shared this with me, I told him that he had achieved every single thing that any guy ever dreams to achieve as a college student and, well,<br>every girl would like his boyfriend to have, but still can't call Atul stud... sorry dude, can't! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Now the talents, he's a rock star who can play dholak like a pro, founder of Avant Garde<br>about which we all know, a decent artist with colors, a decent singer, a decent basketball<br>player and an awesome friend/social animal.<br>Among his bad qualities, he is lazy, not organized, freaks out sometimes and loses confidence, spends too much time doing BC, first with IIIT friends, then with online friends.<br>Among the good qualities, he's ambitious and has achieved his ambitions of being a part of basketball team and starting a new rock band and has launched his own startup, hence is determined and sincere, is very helpful and is a friend to everyone.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part I:<br>When everyone is stranger to you, choosing a roommate makes no sense.

He cleared my doubts, wo doubts bhi jo mujhe uske assignment ke solutions mein aate the. He taught me each chapter, sometimes more than once, even after he had taken a class for others! Once I tried to return the favour by teaching him few chapters in Operating Systems but failed miserably. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>I admit I did irritate him when his actions irritated me, like waking up at 6:30 am and going for running (not the PT), playing guitar or playing rock music in room, or watching movie on my laptop while I slept!  But I bow to you for having tolerated a menace like me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I did hate him for many things but I have to admit that had it not been for him, my existence would have been less known. Also, I do have to admit that when later he started going to music room to play music on his new electric guitar (because room was too small for the accessories and the music!), I kind of missed the music he used to play, and his practice sessions... I joined him once when there was an extra guitar in room and we played the theme song of Top Gun by looking at the notes online.<br>Anyways, third year was a different experience when we got a chance to stay alone, but he again stayed close to me, on the same floor. Although a renouned guitar player and a member of parliament by that time, he still was the same Atul whom I had met in first year. Perhaps we shared better understanding when we started living alone in our rooms. We played music together, made few songs, watched GG, Heroes etc. and movies together, did BC (Baat Cheet) more than we used to do in first and second year. I sent him songs I had written, he showed me few new tunes he learnt on guitar...</b></i></ul><br><br>

I'd always remmebr him for all the BC sessions we've had in music room during our first and 2nd years.<br><br>Our voice blends very finely and we still sing along whenever we're together. He's such a good singer. kabhi kabhi 'sh' ko 'sa' kar deta hai .. but sala aawaz me jo dard hai woh in saari khamiyon ko nazarandaaz kar deta hai. A very dedicated singer ><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><. An awesome guitar player. When we came to IIIT, he had no idea how to play a guitar but come 3rd year and he made a band (all by himslef)and played live during Riders on the storm.

Especially "what I've done" number.<br><br>We used to do all the physics/ITWS assignments in first sem and that was the time when I came to know taht this guy is a bond of physics.

He did it so well that seniors from adjacent rooms came to meet him. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Since that day I had seen various instances where his enthusiasm came over him and he cud perform even in pressure situations. Be it doing a hilarious skit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> in front of entire college which was prepared just few minutes ago (BTW he stole all my dialogues <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) or trying for Mr. felicity or singing Californication in the singing competitions. <br>I still remember when we were talking after our freshers' performance. Vayu's performance was decent <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and Agni had performed terribly <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . I could see how disturbed he was over a performance and on that he said to me that he will make a difference and try to perform better next time.

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>(Part 2)<i><br><br><b>Everyone remembers Kaliphornicason,</b> but probably nobody has ever give a thought to the guy sitting next. I knew from the start that the diction wasn't perfect, but I never said a word about it. I was confident that we were playing well, and that we will pull it off. That people will understand, and encourage. What resulted was a carnage. And at the hand of some of our good friends (I'll never forget some of those voices from our own people), who never realized what they were doing. I wasn't sorry about myself, I had long since given up. I was sorry for him, all the hard work and dedication, all the dreams, coming to this. But I was wrong. This guys doesn't need you feeling sorry for him. Hardly four months, and he was there with a huge rock band. When he sang that rock number on the rhythm guitar, I was standing in the first row, screaming my head off. If I remember correctly, there was a tear or two, too. That was one of the best moments of my college life. <br><br>More about him. Despite being a thorough achiever with a steep learning curve (guitar, basketball, acads, internships, projects, gaming...), he's one of the most haphazard and unplanned of people. I wonder what would a little bit of corporate discipline, or a situation when he doesn't have a number of things on his mind and can focus on a single task, do to him. Watch out!Those in CIQ. If Atul is something in the college, he will be something squared in professional life, that's my prediction and my prayer to God for him. Of course, he still is immature in some regards, but I'm sure people skills is something that corporate life will definitely teach him. <br><br><br><b>Atul wrote an article </b>for the College Magazine. It's in english. And it's going to be the lead article of the mag, when it comes. That just about sums up the guy for you.<br><br>Tags: Guitar, GHEB, Agni, rock band, bond, rocking.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>If I have one feeling</b> for Atul, it is admiration.<br><br><b>First memory:</b> He was saying something in front of some class... saying something in English, not getting a word right. And then somewhere I happened to read one of his english assignments. He'd written 'Nu Yak' for New York. <br><br><b>Subsequent ones:</b> Atul playing Gabbar in the Freshers' skit I hope people forgive me for. And then suddenly one day Atul buying a guitar before the instrumental in the first year... and then coming first in instrumental on dholak. He taking a project under Jayanthi in the first sem. And then at the end of the first year me, Atul and Ranga deciding to learn an instrument each over the summers and forming a band the next year. <br><br>Our guitar sessions during the second year are what have brought us close. I can still picture us playing on the steps of GHEB. A part of me will probably always be playing the guitar on the steps on GHEB with Atul. He was ahead of me in musical acumen, and still ahead in terms of determination to improve on his guitaring. We made huge plans of making a band, and so on so forth. After a while, I realised my limitations, but he was always so bullish, despite our abject lack of resources and I used to wonder as to from where does the daring to dream so big comes from. And I think that around the same time I had also realised that this daring to dream big was what had taken Atul Dwivedi from the small village in one of the most God-forsaken places in India to IIIT, the last name in CS. <br><br>Together we arranged for a personal tutor. But while I woulda been happy playing the acoustic guitar all my life, Atul arranged for money (from God knows where not) and got himself an electric guitar. While I was happy to come third in Felicity '07 Group Singing among proper bands, Atul was furious not to have come first. We parted ways at the end of second year, and that was for the best, as I was only an impediment to his progress. He deserved worthier jamming partners. <i>(contd.)</i><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
