<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Deepak is by far the most skinniest guy I have ever met. Very shy kinda, quite reserved and silent type. We both stayed in cellar for the first two years but we could see him out of his room very few times. We usually talked during our meals in yuktahaar. Very friendly, soft spoken, disciplined and quite cultured. Its really hard to find him doing BC on a regular basis. <br><br>We have not talked much but the time that we have, I always enjoyed his company. Its really good to have him around. You can also find him leofying people in the mess though this happens rarely. Recently we all came to know about his volleyball skills. By looking at it one can never think that he will be able to push the ball but you see him playing and he will make you eat your own words.<br><br>May you do wonders in your future.<br><br>God bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Deepu, dat's what i call him. We hardly met(one on one) in 1st and 2nd yr, don't remember much of those meetings but what i could remember is his helpful and friendly nature. I don't know how he manages but this guy never says NO to anyone, to anything. You might want to knock his door anytime but he never complains about it. He is ambitious and at the same time hardworking also. He is a bit shy in front of girls like most of us <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, waiting for THE ONE (she must be very lucky <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), believes in long term relationships with everyone he consider as a friend or more.<br>We have become very good friends in 4th year and i did learn a lot from this guy and still learning <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>He is good at cricket and volleyball, used to play soccer in first year but IIIT Ground ruined his football career. Let me share something about his nature which most of us don't know or never realized is that everyone (i mean everyone) will feel very comfortable around him because he is a good listener, caring and helpful(what else u need ) but he feels comfortable with few (very few) in IIIT, doesn't share much to most of us, i feel very happy that he shares his feelings and past life with me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , The best thing i like about him is that he always think about the ways in which he can make his parents happy.(yeah, we all do think but believe me not as much as he does)<br>I consider myself to be a good critic, i always try to point out mistakes and negative points about anything (or anyone), but i don't have anything for deepak ( i mean it), he is very simple aur kabhi bhi gussa nahi aata . In the end, i wish he gets whatever he wishes for very soon and our friendship never ends.<br>Sometimes I hurt people's  feelings (with the reason, they don't understand) at anytime and most of the time i don't regret, but deepak i am really really sorry if i ever did to you in past and sorry in advance if i do that in the time to come ( i am going to regret that for sure)<br><br>Shaadi par bulana mat bhoolna <img src=Smileys/3.gif />  <br><br>Good Luck for rest of your life. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is friendly, happy, gregarious, sociable, genial, cordial, affable and the one who likes parties and all the eating and drinking that goes with them. If I have to club all his qualities in one word, I would say he is CONVIVIAL. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I did not know much about this guy in my first two years. But I had heard a lot about him from others, especially from Mahaveer. Mahaveer used to praise a lot about him. According to him, he was a "CHHUPA RUSTAM" (i.e. who has a lot of knowledge <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> but does not let others know about it).<br>He built a very good flash website for Felicity'08 <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> but it is really disappointing that it was not finally chosen. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>If someone would ask him for help, he would surely provide it irrespective of whether he is his friend or not. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He is really a great guy to befriend with.<br>I enjoyed "Systems and Network Security" course with him. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Wish you achieve, what you aim in your life. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>(Continued)<br>- Rumors has it that offlate he has become a chick magnet<br>- We made rapidshare accounts together after uploading and sharing you-know-what.<br><br>(Will write more if I remember more points.)<br>Take Care and All the best for your future and do keep in touch.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Deepak Vig can be best put as the silent assassin ... remains silent most of the time but excels at whatever he does and makes the best of his time. Our friendship flourished during the IT workshop III project in which we used to think of various ways of getting the work done using minimal effort but that was the start of the Deepak era from which he kept on learning different technologies. I and he made a very simple php script as our project initially but later on He himself completed the project even though I,Kapil,Dharmeet where his teammates. This era is still in progress and by now he has learned various technologies ranging from flash, C#, Java, SymbianOS, PHP, AJAX, CSS, Javascript, Flex and so on. <br><br>The Masterminds Game:<br>	In 3rd semester, I and He played the biggest trick both in terms of time and katvaana of which the victims are unaware till date. Though we have forgot that this event has happened we share funny moments when we recall of how we fooled most of our friends.<br><br>The Sportsmen Vigla:<br>	Deepak is a star player in cricket capable of sweeping the fastest bowlers in IIIT onto the legside field <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif />. He is also an excellent athlete (secret lies in yuktahaar food maybe). He has excellent volleyball skills and returns the ball to the other side very accurately and consistently.<br><br>Road to Eldorado:<br>	I was never an event organizer and once I receive this message from Vig : "Do u want to help organize this event in sunday carnival?" and I was like :"WTF!!!". Most of the time I sit Idle so I replied "Yes". Me,Deepak and Srirang were supposed to organize this oncampus treasure hunt. Deepak and Srirang made the puzzles while I framed the questions in the computer. The walk that day we had in IIIT trying to find out the weirdest locations in IIIT is a moment to be remembered and not to be forgotten.<br><br>Other Points worth mentioning:<br>- We used to goto the Coffeeshop quite regularly together in 3rd and 4th semester sharing funny moments of how our mastermind game was going on.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>vig - first time i met him, i felt guilty ... went to his room and found it very neat .. very very neat .. he completely changed my notion that hostel rooms r always dirty n unmanageable ... thanx buddy ... learnt a great thin from u ... cleanliness ... and ya easy - going person as well ... aur haan .. agli baar yuktahaar mein dikhna mat sale ... mar dalunga <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>keep rocking bey ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=dharmeet.html>Dharmeet Singh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If we can define friend then I can write his testimonial or for any person in our batch. But it is impossible to define a friend, so keep me out of this business of writing testimonials <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>One thing which really surprises me is even after keeping fridge in his room, his room is very very clean from my room, I am trying to learn this from him but not succeded till now <img src=Smileys/2.gif />, kuch tips dedo sir future ke liye <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br><br><br> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i?><br><br>Ahh.. And I also recollect his entertaining batting during Summers '07. I would always try and get into his team, thanks to the shots he played. And, I've never seen him miss anything in volleyball! Wish he'd have played it earlier.. He could have been an asset to Aakash House!<br><br>And yeah.. He becomes a little cranky when it comes to girls <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Though hilarious, some of his comments on Mahaveer's post (as Cracker) on girls were very controversial. It was fun though, it led to a long ensuing discussion! I've often seen him pulling GKB's leg over the issue of girls. Even during the third sem, when I used to hang out with one of my female friends, he would leofy me with her name <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .I think he's one person who needs to find a girl quickly for himself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All the best in life, buddy!<br><br><b>Person/character he resembles: Combination of Kitty from 70s Show and Matthew Hayden (for the sweep shot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br>Fav memory: Tutorials in your room<br>Message for him: Get a girl!</b><br><br>Peace.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i?><br><br>I hardly remember Deepak from first year. He was this silent soft spoken guy who I never interacted with. In second year, I moved to cellar, a place where I made a lot of new friends. And Deepak was one of them. He was my neighbour, and I must say that I was very lucky to have him as one. First of all, he'd always have a lot of stuff stacked up in his fridge. That was the time, when we had this gym fever and his boiler was very helpful <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>Vigla is also a fodu when it comes to using new technologies, especially in the web development field. That was the time when we had the ITWS-3 course, and I often coudn't make of what to do with the assignments. During those days, all I had to do was hop out of my room, jump into his room, grab something from the fridge while he would solve my problem <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I've had a lot of sweets in his room, which was a bit of a meeting place for all of us at cellar. I remember all <br>the BCs we've had in his room. Even during exams, the tutorials would always be taken in his room- and the sweet guy that he is, he'd never refuse <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . One of those tutorials saw 20 people filling in the room! I'd also bug Deepak for movies, softwares and what not.. And he'd always lend his helping hand.<br><br>During third semester, we also had the Sunday Carnival, where I asked Vigla about organising an event. We decided upon Treasure Hunt, and boy.. It turned out to be among the best events that day! I think it was his first event, but he managed it brilliantly! After that hes done it numerous times, and am sure he must be knowing every nook and corner of the campus now <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His technical skills saw him organizing CacheIn for Felicity '08, and I must mention, it was very well done <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Deepak Vig or Viglu Vodafone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> or Bijlu aka Cracker....etc.etc, lots of names. He is one of the most solved person I have seen. He knows very well what to do and what not. Apart from this, he is humble, modest, very helping, extremely hard working, fast learner, good athlete.<br><br>I know him from Kota, both of us were in same coaching institute. He was very punctual to classes, so is here. Always completes the work within the deadline <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He works within his limits, a bit shy according to me, but is more technically sound than anyone else <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He has learnt lots of new technologies in no time and has completed various projects on them. Whatever the project is, one always wants to keep him in his team. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Apart from this, he is a very good athlete. Plays cricket and football very well. Cricket mein sweep shot ke liye famous hai, kyonki isko bas ek wohi shot khelna aata hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Bowling to bilkul nahi aati <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, but a nice fielder.<br><br>We had lots of outing together, and one of it was unforgettable. We went to celebrate our Cache-in win, Viglu ne auto waale ko poore hyderabad ghuma diya(restaurant nahi mila) and we ended nowhere except spending 1000 bucks in travelling <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Finally went to Pizza Hut and had fun.<br><br>Kudos to his friendly and extremely helping nature. Dharmeet ka fridge iske hi room pe pada rehta hai, kabhi bhi chale jaao, kuchh bhi khaa peeke aa jaao, always open. He never says NO to anyone, even if he is sleeping or busy with something else <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>All the best Viglu for your future. Be in touch.

<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1- </i><br><br>Viglu aka vigla P- <br>In the beginning of college .. he was one of the persons I used to spend time with. Both of us had a similar kinda interest in technical side. Learning new things/ languages n technologies became his passion.  Bhai body - builder hua karta tha .. kher abhi wali physique par na jao <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . I remember we used to compare our muscles. He planned many times but hardly came to gym. But you can find eggs, milk , juices or pta nahi kya kya  ....room me dairy khol rakhi hai. Itna khata hai fir bhi sookhta ja rha hai .  Mujhse 2 sal bada hai .. par 2 sal chota lagta hai. Padhai ke mamle me bahut light rehta hai .. meri bhi  tension khtm ho jaya karti thi , iska padhai ki taraf attitude dekh ke. In most of the semesters we took almost same courses. Vigle ne jab mobile liya tha .... to uska camera usse jada maine use kiya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Jab kabhi bhi bahar malls bagera me jate .. to hum dono 'hariyali' dekhne nikal jate <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Bandio ke peeche frushtu hai .... par aaj tak koi nahi mili <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bhai sahib Punjabi songs or movies ka shauk rakhte hain. Inke accent me bhi punjabi ki feel aa jati hai. Punjab da asar <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . He loves travelling, reading ( <b>'21 ways for becoming millionare' </b> kinda books <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) , movies and trying new things in all fields. Ab tak ki sari trips me vigla jarur gaya hai. In the begining he used to speak very less like me .... but now hv improved like me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Logon ki lene bhi lag gya hai ab to <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .  He has very calm nature. I hv never seen him angry with someone.<br>He is really honest, fun loving and simple guy. When he takes some work seriously in his hands, he does it with full dedication. Even in the last months of college when everyone is doing BC ,getting nostaligic ....he is doing some work in lab <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> .  Time se sone ki bimari hai isko.Kuch bhi ho jaye par breakfast miss nahi hona chahiye. <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I came to know Viglu better when we organized Cache-In together....  Earlier than that he, for me was a guy who knew everything to know abt web-scripting. During Cache-in I cud see how the cool the guy is ( may be because he had organized so many events that he had become habitual of that stuff... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) As said earlier he is one of the best website designers we have in our batch. I have seen him in classes when everybody wud be reading a novel and he wud be reading a "Complete reference to Java Script" <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> or something like that. The way he cud read such a boring stuff ( my opinion <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) shows his interest in the field <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ....  Later our friendship cemented when Ranjit wanted to come to Gheb so I moved into cellar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... There I came to know that he is more famous for his kitchen...  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I cud see guys going to his room in the night and disturbing his sleep when they wanted something, never once he got irritated <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> .... But don't thing you can take advantage of his patience ( ask KaisaPaisa guys <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )....  A very moody guy in that respect he can devote himself completely for a task but can also leave it if he is not satisfied <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He also likes to travel a lot...  There are very few places left in India which he hasn't visited.....   His philosophy is very simple, to try everything at least once <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....  I had extreme fun with him during summer internships...  Specially when we went to one of our employees' house or when we used to dodge a call ( I hope u understand wat i mean <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) I cud never forget the long talks which we had when we used to come from Kothaguda to our college...  A very sporty guy, is ready for any adventure...   as long as you are offering something new <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He was also manager of our trip to Vaishno Devi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>In the final sem I spent a lot of time playing VB with him ( our team always won <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) or in CS but the real fun is in shouting "Viglu..Viglu.." <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Hope u find your Vigli soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. My office is quite close to his so hopefully we'll be in touch.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Finally as Sachin said "Demand your share"</b></i></ul><br><br>

Fridge, heater, boiler etc. are there in his room . Even if its 2a.m. we can wake him up for heater etc <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. and he gives the things silently without any irraitation or anything.( Hope I can be like that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). I think he believes in giving. Kabhi kisi aur ko dene nahin deta <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> kuch na kuch aisa kar deta hain ki log uski le <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Altough he improved a lot in this front.<br><br>contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Viglu. Vigla. Thats what I call him. A very very very cool person. I don't remeber having spoken to him in first year but from second year onwards we were like great friends. Thanks to that Sunday Carnival. We were supposed to organize 'campus-treasure-hunt'. And we did it SUCCESSFULLY. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br><br>To be frank, in first year I used to think that Vigla is autistic, nerdy types <img src=Smileys/26.gif />. It took some time for our friendship to grow but as of today it has grown out to be very strong. and I'm proud of it. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>We came more closer during the Felicity 07 time. Just one day before the event seniors asked us ot prepare the clues and we were like WTF! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> but still we managed to re-make the clues and get them printed out and conduct the event in right time. ( Now that you are my colleague we'll organize a treasure hunt in Verizon too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) And that was the day when I recognized his talent. We made around 40 clues in 1 day ><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><(night, to be more specific). After the event we laughed our asses off looking at the dumbness <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> of NIFT guys <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. I'm never gonna forget that moment. Even today whenevr it comes to campus treasure hunt, he'll be my first choice as a partner (coz hum log campus ka chappa chappa jaante hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>And then Vigla asked me to set questions for Cache In too. I wasn;t a memebr but he trusted me and asked me to make questions. That must be the unforgettable moment with you yaar. Woh Shrikant ko 'pehchaan koun?' wale ping karna <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . Woh raat raat bhar baithkar questions banana. I'm gonna miss all that fun man. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>Trivia: We both got selected for the interview of CA for the first time. Both rejected. Now both of us are in Verizon. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>We'll have fun there. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future.
