<b>For <a href=shashankl.html>shashank lagishetty</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Apart from pissing people off with his weird status messages<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> he  is really a very nice guy. Does things all planned, I admire him for the way he plans his day<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He wants to do something good for the society  and is working towards it, he has recently joined an organization to help people. <br>Does things very silently whether it is eating a biscuit or preparing for an exam. Takes lots of care for his receding hairline. I should also say that he is punctual, goes to bed as early as 11  and gets up at 6 and like a warden in a hostel rings the bell for others. Visits home as frequently as a week. <br><br>He loves playing cricket, recently he has been holding up OPL for us.There are lot of memorable things between us, needless to say most of them were abt our vinjam. He gives me full support in pulling vinju's leg. Its fun hanging wid u guys. I wish you to have very nice time under Bezawada and complete ur M.S as soon as possible<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> cheers! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samantapudi.html>S.Rama Krishna Raju</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I know this guy from our first sem. He is a very hard worker, he is now working day n ni8 for his M.S. Lives to himself, has already got lot of future family plans<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a very good poser one couldn't really resist to take a foto. Does lots of mischief, he threatened to kill me if I write any of those in here so sry I couldn't help.<br><br>well coming to acads I donoo how he managed to get A's in the subjects which I taught him, me being stuck around  B- n c's in da first place<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has got excellent power in winning arguments even tough they doesn't hold any logic. The power being 'saying things so fast that the other person doesn't notice them'. He is one of those primitive researcher who has found out that untar command doesn't work in linux<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>all in all he is very good amiable person and is working hard to complete his M.s in 5 years, miss u a lot ...I wish you all the best for ur future<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>well to start with although my acquaintance with him is limited to very small period, he is a very intelligent and good person. when it comes to internet and things I should accept that he is a geek<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> One couldn't count the no. of sites he browses in  a day. He loves computer graphics very much which he had worked for last 1-2 years his a** off for honors. I wish pigeon would give it to you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>As he pointed out we had a lot of interests in common I think he is the first guy I met who has such a great affinity for non-veg<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, playing nfs,<br>solving puzzles.<br><br>Yes "mischief is his middle name" but the kind of mischief he does is no better than a first class child does<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> sprinkles  water on others and hides,<br>blowing a whistle which oscillates between his mouth and nose are the kinds of mischief he does. Smiles all day all long I don't know what he wears<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I kinda love his groan which he does when he doesn't has an argument to take on u ....its like someone deliberately has put a stick in his a**<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>We miss u a lot dude ... I wish Yahoo! is in Hyd<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> nway we will regularly update the fun u miss<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> c ya bye! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>baboi veedaa!! I have never across a creature like this ..he has a got a  memory like an elephant ... I couldn't understand most of the things he speaks about He is truly a geek <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ....you should have seen  the way he answers the questions in contests ... I feel gr8 to have such a friend<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>To give a description of his personality  his face is the ideal smiley <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> always smiling, remains totally cool...I haven't seen him getting frustrated anytime always lost in his alien world and responding 2 mins late to the  real world and that's the reason we entitled him with nickname kondaa!!<br><br>He does lots of things ...you should of seen his to-do list. He has a passion for hatke type of words/phrases and whenever he finds them they become word of the week, he uses those words all long the week no matter wat the situation is ..some of his fav words which i remember are Racha!!, cliche, pandga cheskoo, vachi naku <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>although the words seem simple but when he says in his style u know wat it is like ....<br>    <br><br>recently we have started solving crossword together and every time I end up with you r a geek type of expression on my face<img src=Smileys/77.gif />!! he has lots of patience in him, he answers all my questions patiently. I am sure I don't miss him after IIIT since we all r planning to have the same flat<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>there is this funny experience with him which goes like this .... he came to my room to solve crossword..hey buddy just a moment i gonna use bathroom..k sure...returns and started solving ...after 5mins heads back to bathroom again ...on return  i asked him watz up ???... he replied me "sry i was quite unsuccessful in my first attempt"<br><br>finally all the best for ur muse  and keep rocking !!! btw  your new cellphone promotion campaign "Nokia 36-24-36" rocks!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>To begin with he was my roommie in 2nd year and needless to say that was the best time I had in IIIT, I learnt a lot of things from him. I never came across a person who has more G.K than him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, ofcourse  there exits another guy I will describe him afterwards. we had done lots of stuff together, remember we used to play NFSMW in our room, and those awesome rasna drinks and britannia mary cake chocolate/vanilla flavour which we used to have<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>we used to have competition while doing our assignments especially graphics. He has a lot of interest in graphics which i noticed when we were doing those<br>assignments and he had also won our felicity08 game designing contest. I didn't had the habit of reading books and it was he who helped me in doing so. I used borrow books from him, he used to recommend books for me based on my ability.<br><br>I will never forget those hang outs and funny experiences, wanna have a drink ??? he never replied no to me. It was in our 3-2 i guess we had developed this habit.He kinda fallen in love with his cellphone  recently and been taking care of it day n ni8.<br><br>He also has this disease of changing decisions in a split second, I hope u overcome this and be more confident while taking decisions.I hope u will finish M.S here as soon as possible, I wish u the gud luck for ur future .</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>To start with he is a very amiable person I think this is his charm that made him to connect almost each n every person of our batch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I first met him in second year while playing cricket in gheb, I kinda remember that day ...yes, its our Republic Day, He wore this saarang t-shirt holding a carry bag in his hand and greeting everyone. From then the era began...and guess wat it will be continued outside IIIT too. I will never forget those days when we have done our OS assignments together,dude how come we didn't had a project together?...and we have done lots of stuff like crawling orkut for cute pics....this is  when orkut didn't had restrictions on user's pics..orkut now sucks!. <br><br>we share many common interests like playing online games solving puzzles n ofcourse sudoku. I never known till recently that he is good at GK. <br>He is also quiet good when it come to other than acads.  He sings n dances to his tunes....plays piano, he has one in his room. Am I forgetting <br>anything? Yeah! he is a very very good narrator, one never gets bored in his company. <br><br>we share many funny experiences together and its all been abt our dear sharbat<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> whenever we feel bored we just knock his door and then it begins...<br>I will never forget the "helmet" joke.<br><br>finally wat i want to say is u rock<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and I wish we both share a classroom again in near future<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>First thing that comes to my mind while writing  testi to this guy is I should be careful  since he has this huge fan following spanning all hostels. Everyone knows he is a good designer and stuff but I will tell u the other things, He is very good C programmer which I have noticed when he was my roommie,participated in many online programming contests, has a great passion for bikes,cars he has a small ferrari car in his room and ofcourse 2-3 mclaren bikes. <br><br>Testi which I would have written if asked a few months back<br>who is silent, who doesn't give a damn to girls, who is innocent, who doesn't know how to chat with girls, who doesn't flirt, rather a thin good looking guy who minds his own business and nothing else. <br> <br>Till recently he has this "innocent" makeup all over him but not anymore thanks to <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> spotted in the limelight. <br><br>I wish you a successful and bright career, u have the potential to become a great designer I hope to see you as a great artist in future. dude u rock <img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=svimjam.html>Srikanth vimjam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is the one I spent most of my time with in here, we come from same college but didn't really<br> know him then as I do now. I didn't came across a more benevolent person than him, he is the one <br>I go to when I need  any help, he is there for u anytime. He is kind at heart, unselfish I can say. <br>I don't know how many times I made fun of him but everytime he receives it with a  simle or ends <br>up with puching me and then apologises. okay let me think of any daily routines  he does ...yes here he goes <br>1. he changes his mind in a matter of few seconds <br>2. Reads newspapers and points out mistakes in them.<br>3. tries very hard to run but his Airbag doesn't allow him to do so... not even bending <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>4. This is the most important one ...he showers his pearls of wisdom he acquired on that day to everyone in his feild of view, <br>note : by everyone I also mean complete strangers<br><br>One more thing I admire him of is his bating, he is known across our batch for hitting sixes although spends little time at crease. <br>He is scared of water, when asked for the reason he responded with somebody told him that he has a "Jalagandam". <br>I share lot of funny experiences with him, I couldn't forget the scene when I told him abt the networking in a dual core pc and also when we(me and vam) <br>narrated him the Apple theory in first year<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Last but not least he is great fan of our dear Balayababu.. dude u rock!<br><br>finally a note for everyone : If u ever have any confusion in deciding which restaurant to dine, just call him he will bless u with all the details u need <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br> <br>note for him : I wish you have success in ur career and take care of your health properly. cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>
