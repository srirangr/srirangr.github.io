<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The Mathursss, apun kaa yuktahaar ka sathi is one of the guys whom I like very very much (except on a few occasions). Kabhi kabhi ispe bohot zyada laad aata, patlu saa hai aur zara mein laal ho jaata hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Irrespective of the fact that he takes bath or not, he is most of the times neat n clean. I remember knowing him through Raman (they used to play TT together). Also I was a big reason for his inclusion in TB as I was very fond of him from the beginning <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In the workspace too, I used to work on his PC. He is that chill kinda fellow who mingles around nicely with people and is not very demanding. He can be seen  hanging around at almost all places in the college, be it CZ,TT, TV room, yuktahaar, LTRC lab, playing cards, cricket in morning, etc. <br><br>We have done many a things together - hunt for DJ sponsors that was real unsuccessful fun, editing music for dance pieces <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> yuktahaar meals, home journeys, mere paison se teri treat at Barista <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , ISB bike trip, ES1 night out with Somani,etc. You, me, Raman and Vipul form a deadly combo for some solid BC jo main bohot enjoy karta hun <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Is bande ko hamesha lagta rehta hai kee duniya iska kaat rahi hai aur ye hamesha satark rehta hai. Raman aur main bohot lete hain is baat par. But the bloke is a very good friend of mine and I like you a lot body. We will always be friends for life. Aish kar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>God Bless you<br><br>Song for you: maa da ladla</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It is actually so hard not to admire Vibhav that I actually don't do it coz then that would be the only thing left to do. His geniousity and grit are hard to match.He is that one of a kind unique student who dares to dream big and act accordingly. He has the guts to go that extra mile and achieve the unachievable. At this tender age, he has tasted a lot of success and he is just raring to go and reach the optimal levels of endurance. <br><br>A totally outspoken guy who speaks his mind at will fearlessly. He loves debating and is very adamant on his arguments. He has learnt alot in his life through his experiences. After a troubled childhood he was determined to do something fruitful for his family and he is on th best possible path to carry the spirit.<br><br>One of the most conspicuous creatures around, he captures attention through his weird statements spoken in an even weirder tone. We have had some memorable moments together and I will cherish them throughout my life. Especially the times when he used to tell me about his love interests, likes, dislikes, and life in general. I respect your uniqueness and the path you have chosen for yourself. And we would be always be bros throughout our lives. All the best in life.<br><br>Song for you: vo to hai albela, hazaaron mein akela.<br><br>Your bro<br>Baba</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>For traditions sake, ek baat khalegi is birtday par, kyunki main is baar tujhe wahan se call nahi kar paunga jahan se pichle teen saalon se karte aa raha hun - Bhopal mein Shahpura Park ke samne wale Sanchi corner se <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But thik hai, is baar bhi kuch special hi hoga - I'll make sure.<br><br>Ab tune Felicity mein kitna kaam kiya, kahan kahan events mein organize kiya, mentor ship mein kya kiya - ye sab main nahi likh raha, bohot boring hai plus baakiyon ne to likh hi diya hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And now the time has come for this testimonial to end, and in a few days our college life. But that will not affect us at all. Infact zindagi ka safar to abhi shuru hua hai dost, sath mein tay karna hai, ab tu Bangalore mein ho aur main Pune mein hun usse fark nahi padhta. Coz there are some blokes in college whom I will be in contact with thoroughout my life and you easily top that list. To chinta waali koi baat hi nahi hai, tere <br>bacchon ko main hi sambhalunga, jaise tune mujhe <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Cheers to us bro, we blody rock.<br><br>God Bless you<br><br>Songs for you : hum dono hai alag alag, nisultana.<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The things which he can draw with a pencil are really amazing. I hope he becomes a renound cartoonist some day. Actually dude you can take Bal Thakre's path - pehle cartoonist, fir neta <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He has passion for movies and obsession with SRK to a great great extent. Infact I once told him that dude you are one arse of SRK, the other being Khatri <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I really respect him for how he has managed to do what he wanted to in these four years. He has good analytical skills and he put them to a good use during this time. His school days had some glitches and he was determined to overcome them in college life, which he did to perfection. I hope you understand what I am talking. A brave effort brother - kudos. The sweetest felling is to conquer your bad-self. As an individual he has matured a lot and made a strong statement to the public by his deeds. But there is always a room for improvement as learning and evolving is a gradual process in life.<br><br>Ab main apun dono ki chemistry ki baat karun to kuch khaas hi rahi hai ye in chaar salon mein. Dhaasu shuruaat hui thi first year mein jab dono batch ke stud the, fir first year ke hloidays mein roz ki online chatting iski, meri, adi aur maroo kee. naa jaane kya kya discuss karte the <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  Come third sem, ye thoda college activities mein zyada busy ho gaya aur mujhe thodi ill-feeling aayi . But vo 3-4 din hi rahi aur fir evaporate ho gayi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Fir sala chalu hua pappu ka <br>silsila. ise main baccha laga aur isne mujhe pappu bana diya. aadha college ab mujhe pappu bulata hai. We are like saif n akshay in main khiladi tu anaadi, the only difference is kabhi ye khiladi hota hai yaa main. Most of the times main. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> From the pappu-times he has given me lots of care, love and support which is very very dear to me mann. Thanks for everything. I do not express myself very often because I take you for granted, aur aage bhi aisa hi rahega, toh <br>bura manne ki to sochna hi mat. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>A rare guy who knows most of the people by their names in the college. Whats more he has a good rapport with the security guards as well and adresses them by their names which is as humble as one can get. Kudos to you for that brother !!! And he enjoys immense faith of the faculty as well. They literally call him to their offices and talk about various things. No wonder he has a better understanding of things than me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Chand bhai is an extremely helpful person, kisi <br>ko koi bhi dikkat hoti hai and I mean any one from across the batches, they seek Chand's help or advice. sala har jagah pahunch jata hai, ekdum tatparr rehta hai madad karne le liye. par mauke ka fayda uthate hue netagiri bhi jhaad aata hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Almost sab jaante hain ise college aur college kaa samruddh karne ke liye isne kaafi kaam kiye hain.<br><br>He had a tough time during the placements, specially because he had high expectations from himself. But alls well that ends well.But I do hope he learnt from the whole experience and got to know himself much better beacuse I feel there were a few things from which he used to ran away from himself and there he was facing them face-to-face during the placements. On this listening part, I'd like to differ from others. He has become a poor listener these days and goes <br>sardonic at times which is irritating. Sala ciggi bohot marne laga hai aajkal, baingan mein mili hui hai filhaaal iski will power, but I am sure jab WO bolegi use ditch karne ko ciggi ko, tab pakke se kar dega <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  Aur iska har cheez ke baare mein opinion hota hi hai, bhale hi wo cricket ho yaa fir train reservation. Aur har jagah body dikhane pahunch jaata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> His general intro is - "Hi I am Subhashis Chand, my dad is in army, look at my muscles" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> At times, ekdum blank rehta hai, pata nahi kahan rehta hai dimaag. Aur Maths kaa naam sunte hi bichare kee fat leti hai. But he is a gem when it comes to creativity and artistic traits. bohot hi zyada umda sketching karta hai aur poster designing mein bhi maahir hai. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In the end we used to force him out of our room. One night I made a point to torture him and <br>stayed in his room till 4, Manish - the poor sufferer <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>He is extremely competitve, most of the times in the positve sense but at times it takes the better of him. And I would hold this quality of his responsible for the formation of TB. Just because some random guy in the batch claimed that his is a very strong circle of friendship, he became jealous and wooed us all to make an official group and call it something <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And TB was born which I think is the best thing that has happened to us in the college and all will <br>remember it throughout our lives. Thanks for that bhai. I guess dance, being our common talent takes a lot of credit of bringing us close. A night was given to us to prepare a dance sequence for an occasion, and what we came up with was something spectacular and has gone in the history books of IIIT-H. Who can forget Ari-Ari <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Talking of dance, we have had some tremendously energetic and funddo moments while preparing dance sequences - be it cult night, youthopia <br>or what not. I have had taken so much of pain to thrust him so-so many steps and he would just not do what I want <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Always doing his own thing and chaniging the step according to his convinience and then giving arguments that he is correct <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>He treats me like a 4 year old kid and I have become used to it and truly speaking more often than not I am okay with it(like it infact) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> though others (Himank, Maroo) get irritated very quickly. Of late I have stopped talking about myself to others but even if I do, it has to be Chand. Oflate he has given me pretty good avices  and I respect him for that. Plus his point of view matters a lot to me which I must confess was not the case earlier. He is a total gem when it comes to relationships, always taking the upper hand and giving his all. He is extremely protective.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>"How would I live without this bloke ?" would be one question which even the Gods will find it tough to answer. Subhashis Chand has been like an elder brother to me throughout the college life. He is someone who understands me the most, cares for me the most, likes me the most, irritates me the most, competes with me the most (especially in the gym and in CL <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). And I guess I have reciprocated very nicely as well (my perception <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )  We share a very very special bond and I am absolutely priveleged to be a part of such a friendship of sorts. Friendship is not a self-sufficient word to express our relationship, <br>it is much much more than that, which I am right now finding it difficult to put it in words.<br><br>I noticed him for the very first time in Sanket's room in NBH. A tall fat fellow with one of the worst pair of shirt and pants I had seen in a long time. As I entered the room he was just blabbering away to glory how he was the one who was ragged most by the seniors. I stayed for a while and then left with a pathetic image of Chand in my mind, I felt sorry for him actually. Second time I noticed him, we were on the same side being ragged by 4th years. There we <br>had our very first conversation and who knew that that was the start of something truly special. Then we spent a lot of time together, not because we wanted to, but because we had to during ragging and fresher's preparation. I must confess he never really appealed me with his acting skills untill his act with Shikha in one of the rounds. And as far as his dancing his concerned, I still think he has a long way to go <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Also I take the credit for he becoming Mr. Frsher (do I need to mention the details <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) After that we became good friends. He used to be horribly dressed throughout the first year and I would tell him so daily. He used to come to my room after 12 in the nights after doing 'masti' with his gang (yeah rite <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and pester me and Chika. In return we leofied him like crazy but he used to just smile and smile some more. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Memorable moments include me discovering the instant lifting of his hand as soon as someone puts a hand on his shoulder. Thanks to his orange full shirt, I coined his nick - sindhi and some of us still call him by that name. Then there were the workout sessions at the gym which are totally unforgettable - measuring weights, pull-ups, learning to skip rope, support on bench-press, endless BC with Khatri n Co and finally juice at Pintoo's. Also his funny gestures have given me ample opportunities  to leofiy his arse anytime. Another memory includes his sending me a reconciliation mail after we had a fight in our room. It was a sweet gesture. But, I still say - Hisar mei to gaay-bhais rehti hain aur wahan lehlahate hue khet hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>A big big kid , he is extremely childish, shy, pure at heart, caring, sensitive, understanding and ekdum mast. For the girls, he is someone who can be taken home back. His bandi would be one lucky soul(he can dance as well <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). I would always remember you as a smiling, confident, Manish wearing an Iron Maiden tee and saying - "aur bey pappu" .<br><br>May you become the CEO of MS. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Song for you : Main jat amla pagla deewana, NIB<br><br>love you mann.<br><br>Hamesha yaad rakhna - Mushqil waqt, Comando saqt <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Manish, the epitome of 3 D's - dedication, determination and discipline is a super human being according to me. If there exists a term such as an ideal son, it would definitely be him. I cant imagine Manish troubling his folks at any point in his life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of the rare ones who has not touched booze or ciggi amongst us. You have my respect for that brother. Commitment comes naturally to him, be it acads, gym, CZ,TT. Giving cent percent and being the best are his keen driving forces. Principles come naturally to him and he has the guts to abide by them.<br><br>In the first year, I wrote a one page description of Manishin the English class which was fun. Somebody told me that he turns his back when Maruti plays porn on his system which was hilarious really. A total bond from the starting when it comes to studies, Manish is extremely intelligent, logically correct and fodu at Maths. Whenever I used to have any kind of doubt, I used to go to him without any hesitation. He has explained me atleast n number of concepts <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Especially during the placement period he was a great support and a great help. It is a delight to get concepts from Manish. The way he explains is majestic.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>' E-maculate Gentleman ' is the phrase which comes to the mind when I think of Adi these days. He has been a substantial influence in my college life, more so in the first half. We got an opportunity to know each other during Fresher's skit prep. where I played an Arabian and he was a Bengali Babu( very funny he was). He was there with me in Aakash house and A-1 English group as well. I instantly disliked him because he answered a lot in class and was very comfortable with PC jargon and programming. I was none of it. Plus he used to wear those full sleave shirts and trousers most of the times to the class which <br> made me think - okay, not my kinda fellow. Not to say the least, he had similar kind of notion about me as well <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> By the time TB happened, we were cool buddies who used to attend English classes together and have dinner together. After TB, we spent more and more time together and were becoming extremely comfortable with each other. We had many discussions but academics was never the one (coz I had nothing to say there <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) I remember we going for Felicity '06 sponsorships to atleast 10 jewellery shops but all in vain. Finally, some lady at a random watch shop entertained us <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Come Felicity '06 Rock show and it was the nastiest thing I had seen <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And this chap was just head-banging away to glory while me and Maroo were sitting on the sofa and cursing the proceedings. That was my first stint with Rock music, not a good one though. But from then on Adi - The Rock God just dragged me into it and I still have not come out of it. NIB (Sabbath) and Unforgiven (Metallica) were the very first songs he asked me to listen to and I liked the feel of it very quickly. From then we have been the best of rock/metal buddies. The times we have spent together listening to music, watching song videos, attending myriads of pub gigs(escape,one flight down, spanish fly) and college-fest gigs have been truly amazing. Once we were so desperate to attend a gig at Escape(DR if I remember it correctly) that we went in the rains. And there we were in an hour head-banging all soaked up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> At all these gigs, half time <br>we would mosh and head-bang and the remaining half he would be giving me some rock-gyaan on the music, bass lines, double bass, lead guitar, sound-man, band's info. We would come back, read the gig reviews on HRL and next day bitch about the self-proclaimed reviewers <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Totally kirraakk those times were. These days my passion for rock music has sort of died down (me not going for the Maiden gig is a testimony to that) but he is still going strong and you can catch him listening to the stuff anytime of the day.<br><br>A metamorphosis which needs a big big mention is he going from a teetotaller to a big time boozy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Yes, I again would take the credit for that. That night we were sitting under the Banayan tree, Adi, Himank, Ranga and me. And I said so many cool things about booze that he actually agreed to it and the next day he made his debut <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Now he has almost become a conaaseuir of drinks and is very fond of it. He was always ready to have his room for booze, be it NBH or OBH and at a time there was collection of 100 plus bottles in his room which we later desposed in an air-bag <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>A testimonial for Adi is incomplete without the mention of Wikipedia and Microsoft. He is so very obsessed with these two words. Even before he was placed with MS, he had switched to IE and all the other MS products <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Also cars intrigue him a lot these days. He is always spotting one or the other biggies in Jubilee and Banjara. Also he did wonderful work as a part of the Placement committee. Frankly speaking that was the first time I had seen him working that hard for a cause ( aalsi sala <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>Memorable moments include me giving him a pep talk on a couple of occassions, once when he screwed his 3rd semester and another one when he was insecure about him not being a good dancer or a singer. (Who sys you dont know how to sing <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Then there was the KK night at GRIET, Riders on the Storm, the aalsi episode at NBH-47. But the Mother of all the moments would be the night out we had near hi-tech with just a single bottle of beer, trying to convince each other that boozing is not bad, the occassion being the arrival of my bike in college <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Another thing which I remember is that he was the one who was concerned the most when I had screwed up big time at Freshers '05 <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Things changed between us after summers of '08. Probably we are not as close as we were in the previous years but I would like to take that in my stride and cherish all the wonderful time we spent together, all the amazing BC we did and ofcous music <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And whatever happens in  future, you have my respect mate. We might not meet very regularly in future but you can always let me know when you are thinking of me. It would make me feel better and make me recall a certain <br>lanky thin fellow with very less hair on his head, glasses, a watch, woodland and a serene confidence on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Wish you a Porsche v v soon.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>SongS for you : Tanhai, Yaaron, Summer of 69.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Writing a testimonial for Himank is fun because as much as I think of the times spent with him, all I do is smile and smile some more. I headr of him for the first time from some senior saying "abe vo chutiya kaun hai jo kal raat Naman Tyagi se milne aaya tha". Next day I saw him in front of NBH roaming arounf wearing a long shirt(tucked out) and totally lost -  abig chutiya he was back then <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I dont' exactly remember when we became friends but yes the earliest memories would be me always bugging him to do my code. Yes I was besharam enough to ask him to write the entire code for mr and not just debug it. I used to meet him almost daily in Raman;s room where he used to come to meet Vipul mainly. Back then he was a regular guy to me. Come third semesterwe had a cold war. which persisted for atleast a month or so. The reason was he teasing me on that baba thing for longer than I expected and he not knowing that I was pissed. But then we sorted things out and since then it has been one hell of a roller coaster ride with this asshole.<br><br>Very late I realizes that he is a big genius and a Maths freek. Thats because he would be the last one to boast anything about himself. Restless to the core, he just cannot do a single thing at a time. Most of the times in his room, he is chatting on gtalk, yahoo, reading articles on cricinfo, indiatimes, listening to Beatles and John Mclean, SMSing on cell and coding on another laptop - all at the same time. Its like the first word he uttered at the age of 2 was - multi-tasking <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is totally obsessed with Sachin, Hitler and Beatles. And he has this flair for old English black n white movies ( Iwonder how any one can bear them).</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Boozing with him has been a total delight at times and then totally frustating at times when he just speaks and speaks and speaks - all bull shit. Firstly, I take the credit for introducing him to booze <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But from then on he has covered a long distance and he is on his way over my league in terms of capacity. We have had some truly amazing times drinking, starting from 12th July 2006. That was the beginning of zillion more drinks to follow. Whenever the two of us drink together, there is one and only one topic that we discuss - bandiyaan, be it in the room or Suraj or Gardenia or Nikitha. We even came to a conclusion once that we two are the only desperate souls left, others are content with what they have <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He has this mammoth capacity to drink a lot - I mean lot. Once he finished one whole bottle of vodka almost by himself. Memorable moments include me and him debating on Sachin with this guy( who claimed he was a prof. from NIFT) at Gardenia. We ripped him apart for sure. Then there was Bhalu calling Chand - "abe to aaja lene Indirapur, hum log Kondacity mein out hain".</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Another facade to Bhalu is his friendship with the fairer sex. Its like he has a ladki dost n each and every city of India, and that too the pretty one's <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And since I knew this I have ever wondered what is so special about this guy and it is a still a mystery to me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Inspite of having so many friends, he is still single (atleast thats' what I know <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )-poor girls. With Bhalu its never 'mera dost', its always 'meri dost'. And he takes absolute pleasure in telling his yester year's stints with chicks. On a future note, I am pretty sure he'll have the prettiest chiks around him(actually he still does).<br><br>He is very much into astronomy and constellations and if you are walking with him in the open sky, you are sure to find him halting and staring upwards(so irritating that is). He is intelligent enough to do an MS internship and get a IIM-L call. I hope he makes it and gets out of Hyderabad and that is the only way he would be satisfied(you know why <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br><br>Memorable moments include the 20-20 WC final. We had decided that we would booze to Indian victory, though we had Compilers end sem the next day.India won. Our bad luck that it was dry day that day(Ganesha Chaturthi),we travelled some 20 kms and managed just a fruit juice <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Another and the most recent once would be our random night out at Medhchal(NH-7),some 40kms from college with no prior plan and minimal paise in pocket. Some fun that was.<br><br>I know a secret of him which no one else knows, purely no one and I take pleasure in that. Probably the only guy in whom I find very little negatives (bas irritating hai bohot saara <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) I am very very fond of this asshole and wish him all the success in life. A request - bastard call me in future when I am not around.<br><br>Song for you: vo to hai albela, hazaron mein akela, sada tumne aib dekha, hunar ko naa dekha.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>What better way to start the account by writing my first testimonial for my x-roomy - Chirag Nahar aka Chika aka Chiku aka porn star. One of the wittiest kids around, he is a good combination of sincerity, discipline and 'masti-wala' attitude. Always ready to crack a fatta here and there and leofy everyone's, he is always ready to have fun. <br><br>Dedication towards academics is one of his core qualities.He is a decent basketball player and a good swimmer. But his shyness takes the better of him at times. For instance, he can dance well but will never do it on stage. Also his constancy restricts him from doing some extravagant things. An advice I would like to give him would be to be more pro-active in relationships. <br><br>We have had our share of hilarious moments like his 'dost', imaginary fighting sequence, daaru at Felicity and many more. We have spend some splendid times together doing regular day-to-day stuff. <br><br>Wishing you all the success in future bro. May God Bless you. Have a happy time at Infy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
