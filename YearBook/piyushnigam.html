But only at the time of exams. Thoda sa senti bhi hai. every week at least 1 baar " Kal ho na ho " to dekhta hi hai. Pehla job lagte hi rona shuru. Kya yaar! come on! first job to yaar khushi ka din hota hai.<br><br>Aaj kal most of the time hamari baatein chatting par hoti hai. Itne jyada velle ho gaye hain ki every 2 mins stat mesg check karte hain aur comment karte hian. (Hau!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Tere patton wale concept ke liye <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Kya cre8ivity hai baap! Wah!! Wah wah!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>BAs yahi kahunga ki jahan bhi rehna khush rehna. Rona mat.

Humne milkar khoob masti kii. Pata nahi kyun ek din achanak main iske room par aake tapka, aur tab ye koi acha sa song chala raha tha. Jo ki mere database me nahi tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. To usse pooch kar maine uska "My Fav" folder collection utha liya. Kya ultimate folder tha. OMG!! Aaj bhi pada hai mere paas. Matlab kind of samajh lo har awesome situtaion ke liye awesome song ho jaise uske collection me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Main to bhai fida ho gaya iska collection dekh kar. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Fir mota bhai ko maine apna English songs ka collection diya jo ki ye apne room par ghaton ke liye bajata rehta tha. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Aur fir hum logon ne game banaya ki song start kar do aur fastest guess karo. Main hamesha jeet-ta tha. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Aapko lag raha hoga ki main itni badi kahani kyun bata raha hun. Right? Ye to sirf itna batane ke liye tha ki "Bas aise hi hamari dosti hui". <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Waise hum aur bhi jyada close to tab aaye jab ye mere room par nashta karne aata tha ( "Bhooka" saala!! )<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> aur mere 1 mahine ka stuff 2 din me khatam karke chala jaata tha <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Aur fir kya tha. Pata chala ki sizes opposite se hai but tastes similar hai. Dono same types ke log hain. Aur bas, hum shuru ho gaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Main iske room par jaata hun, bahut naachta hun, isko bhi nachata hun. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Mazaa aata tha yaar.. nai?. And yeah! I take the total credit of fixing his love story <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Yaad hai wo chatting <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Piyush aka Mota aka Mamme</u><br><br>We didnt interact too much in the beginning and I was quite averse to the idea of having him in TB but he wa quite close friends to many so he came and from there, it came to the extent that I was very pissed when Manish took the room in our wing which he was supposed to occupy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The guy is senti to the core, always caring about his friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I will always remember that incident in front of library in 1st yr when I after talking to sumbdy was quite frustrated and kicked something which was lying on the road, he (along with others) was coming from somewhere and when the banda saw me like this, he woulnt leave me at all and did his best to console me. Banda sala mujhe pakad ke baith gaya tha. Will miss all these things now on <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Another memorable thing would be the time when he cried on my shoulders after his placement.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ofcourse how can I forget mentioning that he goes on dates to temple <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Gajab senti banda hai yaar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Never seen anybody more senti than me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Will miss you a lot man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sorry for not writing a proper one, will surely write a gud one for you <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Piyush apna mota aka mumma!!!<br><br>Well!!! the first word that comes to my mind when I think about this guy is "emotional"<img src=Smileys/26.gif />.. he is a hard core emotional person and never takes things in a light way, har daru party me bahut rota hai, aur to aur iski "naak" bhi roti hai<img src=Smileys/21.gif />..We have been shared same wing for the last 3 years and We are adjacent neighbours for the last 2 years.He is very good human being, achieved lots of things in his life like he is very good at art, played a vital role in the felicity 09, worked very hard for his house<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ...and so on .... <br><br>Despite the fact that he din't do well at the academices in the first year, but later this "amazon" guy worked his arse off, and shown his true colour from the 2nd year and studied every subject very well and finally got the best job of this session<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I remember in 3rd year, when we had taken same CVIT courses and we were always studied together. In the exam time, I used to start teaching him, but due to his extra-ordinary thinking ability, I don't know how it happened but last me ye mujhe padane lag jata hai<img src=Smileys/20.gif />.<br><br>Hes great person but somtimes takes too much stress<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> and makes things messy between himself and his friends(khaas kar ki mere saath)<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> but its okay !!!! har relation me kuch naa kuch fight to hoti hi hai. He is a friend in need, never say "NO" to anyone(khaas kar ki bandiyo ko<img src=Smileys/10.gif />). But seriously I had a great time with you throuout these four years, specially in 3rd year. I will definitely remember you as one of my good friends. <br><br>Believe me You are a great guy but only a few changes is required !!!!<br>Best of luck... You have a great life ahead!!!!  <br>      </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Part - I</u><br>Jis prakar "Piyush" ki ek boond, insaan ko "Amar" kar deti hai .. Usi prakar mere priya dost "Piyush" ke saath ki gayi dosti, insaan ko "Khushi" se tar batar kar deti hai..<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He is a very great guy to befriend with.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a very cordial person who never ever cheats with his friends. And the quality which makes him the <b>UNIQUE</b> as a friend is: -<br><center><b>He is an extremely kind person who easily forgives misbehavior conducted by his friends.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b><br>To justify the above sentence, I wish to give one example: -<br><i>I and Piyush took "Gandhi and India" course in our 7th Sem. In that course, we had to choose a topic for the presentation. Piyush mailed his choice before me. But as was mentioned in the mail sent by Pranav(who was teaching us G&I) we had to go to Pranav to specify our choice and it was me who went to him first. And I told him the same choice which was already mailed by Piyush to him. Since Piyush was not able to come to him due to some unavoidable reasons, Pranav asked me to persuade Piyush to change his choice. I went back to my room and started forcing Piyush to change his choice through Gtalk. During that chat, I used some bad words as well<img src=Smileys/10.gif />(it was all joke), but I did not know that Piyush would take it seriously<img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Then for me, he changed his choice but was not happy with my demeanor.<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> That night, I went to him and I asked him to pardon me for my naughtiness which I did during the chat<img src=Smileys/26.gif />. And he was so kind to me that he forgave me for such a nuisance behavior(it was all joke from my end but not from Piyush's) which I imparted during the chat.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Kudos to such a lovely friend <img src=Smileys/77.gif /></i></center><br>In addition to all this, he is a great student  and a great designer. He devotes his whole concentration while designing or painting. He is a great dedicated guy and has learned a lot in TT just due to his dedication.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Part -II</u><br>I always try to make Piyush smile on my silly jokes because "Jis prakar suraj ki roshni andhera door kar deti hai.. usi prakar piyush ke chehre ki smile dusron ko khush kar deti hai"<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Have a great future ahead,buddy..<br>I wish you achieve whatever you aim in your life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>CHEERS!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I really like this guy... he is so calm and hard working. He's a great artist, I saw his sketch which got 1st position in Felicity's event for some innovative sketching on some theme and it was so beautiful, quite close to a real photograph taken in black and white.<br>I remember going to him seeking help for some doubt I had in Pattern Recognition... he tried to recall all the concepts and gave me about 20 to 25 minutes before he said he was not able to recall and couldn't help me. I felt really grateful that instead of directly refusing, he took all the possible efforts to help me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>His hometown is Ujjain, the beautiful city of temples where my Maama ji used to live and now my Naani lives there. We talked once about Mahakaaleshwar temple and other temples which I visited once with my Maama ji.<br>What I would like to take from him is his artistic abilities and his silent hard working attitude...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sometimes he is a "Ball of laughter" and other times he is truly frustrated and crying like a baby girl either because of assignments or exams or because some prof X's leg is way up in his ass <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. When he is not in one of the two moods I mentioned above he is a sentimental fool <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br>Jokes apart, wo kisi ne kuch kaha tha naa, haan yaad aaya - "bhai banda heera hai heera".<br>We have been roommates for a whole year in our second year and wingmates in fourth year. I have been one of the constant sources of his frustration. Whenever I go to his room, I invariably pick stuff and drop them here and there in his room and sometimes even out of the room. You should see him then, going red with anger. But thats not enough to stop me <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Whenever I feel low or lonely or mischievous, he is the victim <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>"Nigam Brothers" thats what people call us when they see us together, and I cant stop grinning. I assume there is an unsaid bond of brotherhood between us that exists. Most of you may not know but he is very very religious, I mean who goes to a temple on his first date <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Anytime he is in trouble or he is very happy he remembers his God. Most of us, including me, remember God only when we are in deep shit. But this guy can frustrate even mightiest of God. <br>Coming to special powers that he has, he can irritate the shit out of any living or dead man. His not so special powers, he is darn good at sketching and ranks just below me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. His sense of humor can sometimes be very fatal to your belly muscles. He has a very upgraded version of brain, thats going to release only after a few centuries ahead of our times. He can very effectively use his body to knock the shit out of you. <br>When I think of penning down some fav memories, my mind is flooded with loads of them and its hard to pick. I will write some of them, anyway.<br>-> night outs during felicity '08<br>-> watching movies in NBH C-13, like a walk to rem, pulp fiction, twelve monkeys etc<br>-> bike trip on patancheru highway<br>-> uncountable walks to coffee shop and around the campus</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>-> ... and still going<br>Cheers to our friendship <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mota and Me<br><br>I have a lot of memories associated with this person. Some are emotional, funny , irritating but truly memorable. My first meeting with him was pretty unusual, we almost fought. He used to come to Pagare and Chika's room and that was the time we started interacting. He is very emotional and sensitive. We had this leofying competition, we used to count "kaun kiski jyada leta hai". For the first two years he won, he is damn good when it comes to pulling someone's leg but after the "Mumme" incident I won hands down. For the people, he is very good artist, our poster boy, very sharp. He has great analytical skills. I still remember, how good he was in recursion. He was among the first ones to be placed which only<br>substantiate how good he is. I remember the time we spent together when he got an "F" in DB, in fact he deserved an A in the course. Though<br>it helped a lot, he taught all of us DBMS during placements. He has a good dressing sense, man! its hilarious to see when he gets ready for an outing. Second year was  terrible for him and I am glad you came out strong. "Bhai to abhi committed ka Tag leke ghumte hain and mandir mein ghumne jaate hain".<br>He is been misunderstood at times, we had our share of ups and downs. I will remember going to his room at around 2 am with a coffee cup in my hand just to find him doing some really necessary things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He loves biking, I know we scewed the whole bike trip idea, sorry for that. He is very adjusting; I have never seen him complaining about things. He did a terrific job in the design team. Got the whole campus vibrant. He and Sambhav worked day and night to ensure that the campus looks in the festive mood. I remember, me and him sketching the War of DJs poster. He seldom boozes but when he does , he is like a bull. I will always remember the hilarious stuffs you did in the recent Club8 visit. He has shared almost everything with me and I really love you for that. <br>We are good friends and the equation between us will never change.<br>All the best bhai.<br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Motu<br><br>Sabse pehli baat, iska chaar naam maine hi rakha tha. Aur fir use chaar se paanch bhi maine hi kiya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Padhai achchi lagti hai to lagti hai, chalo thik hai. But kisi course mein itna kya interest aa gaya ki use 2 baar karne ki hi thani <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Vaise, he got a placement in a company which mostly deals with the contents of that same course. Then, he taught that course to the whole batch for placements and to some juniors as well for their intern. Kafi yaadein judi hain is bande ki DBMS ke saath <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But, all is well that ends well <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Iske room par jab bhi jao, koi 90s ka gaana like nazar ke saamne jigar ke paas, main shayar to nahi etc chalta mil jayega. I can't imagine that some guy could be this much senti. Bilkul bandiyon ki tarah senti hota hai. Senti movies dekhta hai aur vo movies dekh kar rota bhi hai .... wtf !! First date par apni gf ko mandir le jata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I think bandiyon ko aise hi bande pasand aate hain, fir to main bhi aage se mandir jaya karunga <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Bahut hi jyada brainy banda hai. This guy got an admission in ISI as well. Creative banda hai. His designing skills are class. Poster ho ya batch t-shirt, har cheez ke design mein important role play karta hai. Sketching to awesome hai hi iski. Ek maa ki tarah sabko pyaar karta hai aur sabka dhyan rakhta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Iske room par jakar khoob BC hoti hai. Fatte par fatte chalte hain. Alag hi level ki BC hoti hai jo max janta ko shayad samajh hi na aaye. Logon ko kya peet ta hai unke b'day par, kamina. Makkhiyan udata rehta hai jab bhi koi iske aas paas mandrane lagta hai. Coming to more serious terms, this guy is damn sharp, intelligent, very emotional and a bada bcbaaz. You are a very good friend. I enjoyed the Bc sessions with you and especially that one which we did while watching Veer Zara <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Itna jyada senti mat hua kar. May God give you all the success and happiness aur apni Bc to chalti hi rahegi, dono hyd mein jo hain. Baki kabhi aur. God bless <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . </b></i></ul><br><br>

Transformed into a total studious guy <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> in the 3rd and 4th sem when he got the title 'Guard of the reading room '. Was really unlucky to get a F in DB due to a small mistake when he clearly deserved an A. Really worked with all his heart for the placements and got the highest package in the batch which was a really great feat <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>He also has this hobby of making sisters. Sees a sister in almost every girl that he interacts with but still has made a gf which is really hard to believe and still puzzles many of us <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Went on his first date to a temple and his idea of a <br>perfect honeymoon is visiting all the four dhams <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Considers himself a romantic superstar due to which he got the nick - Romantic Khan <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Very emotional kind of person who is always there for his friends whenever they need him. Was really motivating when I used to get frustrated during placements. I never hesitate to ask for his help whenever I need it and he is always there to lend a helping hand. Still curses me for ruining his last Holi when he and Maroo actually saved my life after the accident, carried me to the hospital and stood by me awake all night. Really helped me in every possible way they could <br>have and helped me recover. Sorry and Thanx a lot Mote ! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Piyush aka Mota aka Haathi. The story of our friendship began from the first sem. Though initially I feared him and avoided talking to him due to the way he used to bully people around him. But gradually with his frequent visits to our room to meet Pagare, I came to know more about him and thus began our friendship. And now, I must say,he is the one of those guys whose <br>company I enjoy the most. The main reason being when he is around we always have some laughter sessions <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> over something or the other, be it leofying someone else around or cracking phattes. His sense of humour is really great and is really fun to watch jab ye kisi ki leta hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>Creativity is something inherent in him and from time to time one can see him making some of the awesome sketches. Testimony to the same is the really commendable work he did in Felicity'08, especially the poster designs and the campus decoration part <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Quite a good singer and listening to him singing makes me feel 'iski awaaz mein ek ajeeb sa dard chupa hai' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>A total cry baby <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> who always finds some or the other reasons to cry for, especially a day before the exams and when he cries the most, he scores the most. He simply goes crazy while giving b'day bumps to people and appears like a mad elephant set free in a jungle who is ready to crush whoever comes his way with his heavy feet. But when the time comes to return the favour he starts crying again <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Another peculiarity of his is his laughing style <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He goes on and on laughing, clapping his hands and moving around and sometimes it irritates the person on whom he laughs at. Always ready to do BC anywhere and on <br>any topic. One thing I really enjoy the most with him is cracking phattes silently in his ears and seeing his reaction to that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mota aka Mumme is the fattiest guy in our batch. Proportionate to his body size are his emotions and feelings for his friends and family. He cries like a baby and its very very easy to make him cry. Quite intelligent and creative to the core. You see his sketches and instantly fall in love with his art.<br>I met him in second year when he shifted to NBH cellar as Shrikant's roommate. I used to look at him as one disgusting person who didn't know how to carry oneself. I used to pity on him and wondered how can someone let loose himself and get so obese. Due to such impression I restrained talking to him. But when we started interacting, things started changing. I came to know a lot about him and realised that he is not as bad as I thought of him. He has a peculiar way of leofying people which is very irritating and thus people often get offended by this (I being the one offended maximum no of times). <br>He is a guy who is very very good to his friends. You can always trust on him to be there whenever needed. He will do anything for his friends and thats one quality which I like the most in him. Coming to his creative skills, he is just awesome. All the creative work in Felicity was because of him and it was the first time when the campus was "actually" decorated during Felicity. He always has some amazing ideas going inside his mind that noone can beat him when it comes to creativity (except Chand <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). <br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>When it comes to studies, he is very sincere and dedicated towards that. This was reflected when he got placed on the second day itself with highest package in the batch. For the first time in my entire academic career, I got an "F" in a course in the college and that too because of him. I was very angry with him when I heard that but later realised that he did not do it intentionally and he was very sorry for that. When it comes to booze, you just make him drink and then just sit back and watch him do some really wierd stuff. When he first smoked, he did it with such a perfection that even regular smokers were amazed by his talent. From that day onwards Pappu gave him another name which I should not mention here <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>He always teases someone or the other for something. I don't like it at all when he does so to me and that's why we have some differences between us. I have even shouted on him so many times for that. He beats people like some wild animal on their birthdays and the problem is that he never admits that. His birthdays have always been special his last one being the most as he took all of us for a treat to Ohri's Banjara where he himself paid for his cake <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>My only advice to him would be try to control yourself and learn to understand when people are getting irritated by your deeds <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> aur thoda kam roya kar yaar <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><b> Most memorable moment </b> would be that "F in DBMS" incident.<br>Good luck.

<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I remember all the bc sessions we had during our journey back home...where he will tell me how to deal with strangers..I remember once in first year...we met some strange woman in train...and she started shooting questions on us..<br>He made up a story that we are brother and sister ...he works and I study in hyderabad...etc..etc..<br><br>The very next year we actually became bro and sis...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And his Bdays are always special...guys plan smthing special for him..<img src=Smileys/10.gif />...well he deserves all of it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> as hits ppl on their bday quite harshly..(as I hear from ppl)<br><br>He is very sharp...but seldom did he apply his intelligence to stuff...In first year he was one <br>who will not listen to classes,was ready to bunk any class and before exams will be looking for someone to teach him.<br>He always complained then that he never gets good marks...But he worked in second year....he is a good performer now..<br><br>Second year was a disaster for him...first scuffle happened ...then DB happened ...at the end CVIT happened..We are under the same Proff. you_know_who..and one of our favourite past time is ...cursing him...we so hated him for not letting both of us attend the MS intern interview...and we were very sad then...<br><br>But things have changed for my friend now... he is well placed ...he has someone special...he has made peace with his life and friends ..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Just look at his placement records...shortlisted for MS(among 7/200)..then the very next day..<br>he made it happen...highest package in batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif />... well we had these little conversations in between interviews..<br>and were trying to keep each others morale high..it was a tough time for all of us...Well we both did get place in the same company...but then I am going to Bangalore...never mind...we are gonna meet at all the official meetings <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and sleep in all the paper presentations <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>  Well we had our ups and downs and we don't stand so close now...but we are good friends...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I'll also remember summer '08- Bangalore and Ooty. Khatri and he were hilarious, and it was laugh a minute with these guys. Actually, he is a funny guy, but gets a little irritating at times :| He is also known for his size, and Manish leofying him for the same <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Other memories with him include the scuffle, the daroo session two days back (rofl at that dude.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ), the leofying sessions, his birthday an year back <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All in all, thanks for all the support mate. May God bless!<br><br><b><br>Person he repesents: Sajid Khan<br>Fav memory: The Chirag incident, riding back to hostel in heavy rains.<br>Message for him: Sometimes, learn to restrain yourself.<br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Piyush Nigam. Our first memories go back to first year, when he'd always hang out in Saurabh/Khatri's room. Back then, I didn't have enough knowledge about Hindi expletives, and these guys never lost opportunity of leofying me. In spite of that, I enjoyed their company. I still remember those plans we'd make in that room (regd college ki ladkiyan) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Shit man.. Back then, I thought he was a pervert. But hell, hes exactly the opposite. He really respects the girls he likes, and is a famous brother <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His idea of romance is also quite different. Add to it his emotional nature, and you have a perfect package for the ladies <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Fortunately or unfortunately, we fell out with the 2nd floor gang, and that was the time when TB was formed. Being very close to Pagare and friends with Chirag and me, Piyush had to be there. Piyush, of course, was the senti guy and he needed support when he had some personal issues. Thats when we got to know each other better- somewhere around that time we also had the DB case. But we've managed to come out of all that, haven't we? In fact, Piyush now has the <br>best job in our batch, which looked like a dream back then. Credit to him for that. Hes proved that he is extremely intelligent and can put in the effort when required. His Amazon interview- absolutely brillitant. I still remember hugging him in the coffee shop after the results- He actually broke down. <br><br>He is also a friend who'll be there when you need one. Testimony to that- the ragging case, the Chirag incident, placement tutes etc. More often than not, he is ready to lend a helping hand. Hes also a fab designer and put in a lot of effort for Felicity '07 and Felicity '08. He came up with some brilliant designs and posters <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is quite creative. And yeah, hes also a good singer <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I remember Saurabh, Khatri and me convincing him to stand for Mr.Fresher just on the basis of his singing talents <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Piyush has a wonderful sense of humors. His instant situations comments are simply awesome. A very adjusting person. Gave me his bed to sleep when my room mate locked the door and slept and didnt get up even after banging the door a lot <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> during our first year. <br>We lived on the same floor but I hardly saw him in his room ever. His room was like almost single occupied. <br>One thing is really remarkable about this guy. He is a very good friend to have. I am sure he can do anything for his friends and that is a quality I really appreciate about him. <br>Good luck for your future !! </b></i></ul><br><br>
