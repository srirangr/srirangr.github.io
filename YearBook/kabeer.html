<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kabeer -- One of the most awesome footballers @ IIIT-H<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. His main strength is his SPEED<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is a very good athlete and has secured First position in 200 m relay on IIIT-H's Annual Sports Day. He is one of the most dedicated guys in our batch. If he takes up something, he devotes his whole concentration in it.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>He is really a great friend of mine.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He even motivates me to play outdoor games viz. football, basketball etc.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And it was him due to which I got interest in football. I have not started playing football yet but I am seeing it on television these days.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>He is really a great inspirational source for guys like me who don't play outdoor games much.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I would surely start playing some outdoor games in future.<br>I am greatly thankful to you for being such an inspiration to me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Wish you a great future ahead.<br>Stay in touch.<br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

He would make max use of d 4 holidays in a course for this. Even if possible he would convince sm1 else to attend classes instead of him whn he's back home enjoying Mom's food.

<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1:<br><br>I had d fortune to be his roommate in d first year. <br><br>We had contrasting natures and it was a new experience for me. He was an extrovert, loved to play out in evenings, always kept distance from studies, was known for playing tricks wid his lab PC (which he made unbootable <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). He used to spend most of his time in lab until he had a laptop. So I would only get to interact wid him in C-9 during our overnite BC sessions. Once he bought a laptop he would never leave d room <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> and thn I felt i had a room partner.<br><br>He has a very deep sleep. There was an incident when he slept early one day, and locked d room 4m inside. I cam back started 4m knocking gently...thn boldly...thn even more bolder...then gave a dozen calls on his cell which was ringing loudly...i gave up and went to Pankaj's room to sleep. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In d 2nd year he swapped his room wid Dharmeet who was njoying a single room...it smtimes makes me feel i was a bad roomie... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He has a great passion for computer games. It can be demonstrated by an example. I had stayed for a day in Delhi in his house. We had reached there around 10 PM, had our dinner and went to sleep. In d middle of d nite, I could hear some 'Yessss', 'Oooohhh', 'Yaaaaar'. I woke up and gathered some consciousness. Kabeer was thr playing FIFA <img src=Smileys/13.gif />, completely immersed in d game. Such is his obsession for gaming.<br><br>I had a wonderful time when I visited his home. He is very lucky in terms of his family.<br><br>He is a great athlete. He has a very agile body...is extremely quick wid his reflexes. He can move 4m one end of d BB court to the other in d blink of an eye and ya i mean it. He is extremely popular in d college for his heroic performances in football and basketball winning matches single handedly for his team...kudos <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>He's a very light hearted person...u can always find him cracking jokes and saying...'bayi jo' and laughing...never takes nething at heart...but jab iski khud ki marne lagti hai to yeh bhaag leta hai wahan se <img src=Smileys/3.gif />) <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Individualism of such extent also might get exasperating for others. It's just not in his nature to accept something just because you're telling him, and he will always verify, cross check things, so much so that you'd hang up your hands in frustration, 'bhai, kabhi to meri baat maan le!' His choices are so clearcut - attaches only to football and basketball. The room has to be kept clean always. The Hindu is the good newspaper. FMS exam over Verizon and Azri. No hindi songs on the Hard disk. No drinking, no smoking. No polluting the mind by using unfair means. No unnecessary frills about anything. No unnecessary emotions...<br><br>It's been a good time with him, and we've really been pals. Quite a unique character, with some commendable uniquenesses. Not many similarities we have, but it's a case of opposites attracting. Has been with me through thick and thin, and that in itself is something commendable. I wish you the best for whatever you do Kabeera. One thing I can clearly see - whether you succeed in something or not, it is you who will own the result.<br><br><b>Little known fact about him:</b> He's an awesome dancer.<br><b>Person he resembles:</b> Thierre Henry.<br><b>In ten years I see him as:</b> A phodu analyst with a small/ startup company, who takes his kid to football coaching everyday.<br><b>Memory:</b> The chicken outings.<br><b>Tags:</b> Wing, football, athletics, CAT.<br><b>23rd April, 2009</b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br><br>Everyone knows Kabeer to be this awesome football player, and I am no exception. He's the Henry of IIIT, scored the maximum number of goals scored by anyone in IIIT, and from all possible angles. The quintessential striker, and the nightmare of defenders. Also an amazing athlete and runs very fast. It looks as if being at the helm of affairs on the field is in his nature. Strikes in football, shoots in basketball. Runs fast. Activities central to the game done so marvelously. And with complete sportsmanspirit. I've never ever seen him get angry on the field in all these years.<br><br><b>Living together for so long,</b> I can ably put a word or two about Kabeer the person. He's very intelligent, sincered and dedicated to his work. These are qualities normally associated with people having high CGPA, and do not get reflected in his academic achievements. But there are other things too. He's an individualist and an objective thinker. Does whatever suits him to the extreme, and other things then do not exist for him, no matter if they're the life of all the others beside him. CSE unfortunately didn't interest him, so he didn't study. As simple as that. Football and basketball have, so he has done well in them. He liked CN, and did so well as to become a TA in the course despite his low CG. MBA studies fascinate him. He'll do very well in his MBA programme.<br><br>Such crisp and precise thinking, taking all your decisions yourself and not taking anything at face value can have reverses, too, as sometimes the crowd might be the one making the wiser decisions. But then I suppose its one's own choice. You take your own decisions, and accept the mistakes that come along. I've never seen Kabeer getting senti about anything, despite facing such tough times in the final sem, and this is something commendable. <br><br><i>(contd.)</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><b>The very first day,</b> I came to know that one of my batchmates had refused to honour the 'Dress Code' set by the seniors. Then later I saw Kabeer in TShirt and Slacks near the basketball court, and I was like, wow! This guy sure has attitude! A few days later, he was the guy leading the pack during the PT 4 rounds alongwith me and Mahaveer, to whom the PED would say, 'Sardarji thoda dheere bhaago'. And then, the very first time we played football together, which tured out to be my one and only chance in Gachibowli Stadium, Kabeer scored a goal against the then college team, comprising of some real stalwarts when he was backed by total novices like myself.<br><br>We started off during the football matches. He's since been a part of whatever football I've played in IIIT. He used to live in the cellar and I in GHEB and we had little interaction outside the field. I think it was in second year, or maybe the third, that we used to play, and then go out and eat, and have discussions about the economy en route. Whatever I ate was seldom enough for me, and I used to feel really short on stamina after football. But Kabeer used to eat very little and still remain high on stamina the whole time, something which would amaze me no end.<br><br>In third year, we started living in the same wing, and that was the time we came to know each other really well. Third year mein he was the co-sports captain, someone to whom I attribute the really clean conduct of the sports matches, and hats off to his scruples for that. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I think in the final year we've come really close, preparing for CAT together, and then sharing the placement blues together for some time. The amount of time I've spent in the wing has been substantial this year, and the masti we do in the wing, of which Kabeer is always a part, is to be given credit.<br><br><i>(contd)</i></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Was not sure earlier if I'll write this or not but here I'm finally writing a testimonial for one of the best football players IIIT has ever seen, Kabeer. A very good bb player too. Infact you just name a sport and he will surely play it better than most of the people around. It has been said and heard so many times that Sardarjis are very funny and they possess a different sort of spirit in their character that makes them stand out in a crowd. I never realised this until I saw him. He has something to his character which makes him unique. His spirit and fun loving nature are the most admirable qualities about him.<br><br>I don't know much about him so cannot write a big one for him. But all in all he is a nice buddy, soft spoken and a great sportsperson.<br><br>I hope I'll write another one in near future.<br><br>Good luck.

We played for the house AAkash, for the batch ug2k5, for the college team. I have to say he is the best striker IIIT has ever seen. I can safely say he is the highest goal scorer in the history of IIIT. I still remember the goal he scores in last minute against JNTU in ICHTALON-08. And then he converted the final penalty to win the game. We also won MUFFKAMJA tourney this year, he scored the fantastic goals of the tourney. He deserves to be the player of the tourney. <br><br>During the match, he says in his typical style "Your ball, Your ball, You got it". Though these words look so simple, they drive away the pressure during the match and also fill in lift the spirit of team <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is a good athlete too. His favourite is 200mts. He is the gold winner in that. We missed you in the  sports day'08. <br><br>He is always cheeful, enthusiastic, highly encouraging the team player. I remember the days when he used to knock the doors of AAKASH house team player rooms to get them for the matches. Hats off man, you are a true sports man.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>All the best for your future and keep in touch. Hope the future kids will be wearing red (having white sleeves) t-shirts with Kabeer written on the back. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In Indian folklore, you often come across Sardars who'r always jolly, smiling and in a good mood! Well, had never met such a person before until I came across Kabeer. Happy-go-lucky Kabeer is a very intelligent chap, but unfortunately, he hasn't been putting it to use in college. I remember our CAT discussions, he was always the one with the best and fastest solutions to any math problem. It was English which was always his Achilees Heel, but he has immense potential to make it to one of the major B-schools. <br><br>You cannot write a testimonial for Kabeer without mentioning football. Be it playing or watching, hes at the forefront of it. In fact his entire wing is extremely passionate about the sport, and is referred to as the 'football wing'. However, Kabeer is a follower of a lot of sports- your quintessential guy who wears tracks and is always ready for a game. I've seen his basketball, and its brilliant! In first year, I remember challenging him to a 100 m dash. Being the guy he is, it was immediately accepted. Needless to mention, he left me high and dry after the race. In fact, hes among the best athelets IIIT has seen.<br><br>I've enjoyed the discussions in his wing (along with Narang) on football and CAT. It was also fun to be a co-tutor in CN, wherein all of us (Kharkwal, Harshita, Sushma, he and me) would always try and run away from responsibility <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Also enjoyed the discussions on HIMYM, downloading, Delhi.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All in all, hes the definition of coolness.<br><br>Stay the way you are mate. May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Berbatov <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: The discussion with you and Khatri on Delhi bus system.<br>Message for you: Its time you switched allegiance to ManU <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
