<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Mridul aka Bhees*ika</u><br><br>He is one person who has been a dark horse throughout these 4 years and has proved his mettle towards the end of college life. The guy has a paper to his credit, got admits in Fodu Universities while no one ever thought that he would be able to achieve these feats. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> All of this has been achieved courtesy the hard work he has put all these years in LTRC. He always had the dream of settling down in USA and fnally he has achieved it courtesy the calls from the univs <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I will always remember the ITWS-III project we did together in Shakti <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Me & Raman iski awesome wali marte the <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Will always remember that project.<br><br>The guy is an encyclopedia when it comes to cricket. He remembers the statistics of every player right from their avg to highest score to matches in which they made it. He even knows the stats of players from 70s and 80s <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Another aspect of his character is the American accent he has, he has been the subject of a lot of leg pulling courtesy his wonderful accent. He never opens his mouth while speaking, thats why the word <b>Bhos**i ke</b> comes out as <b>Bhees**i ke</b> from his mouth.<br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future man.<br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mridul, The NRI of our batch is one of those few guyz who have proved a lot of people wrong by doing somethings time n again. This chap has a reseaarch paper to his name during his BTech and thats not a small thing. Frankly speaking many people would not have thought that he'll get into any good university for higher studies, but he again proved everyone wrong and got admission in sone very gis universities. Hats of to you <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Leave aside the admission, I could not even think of him getting a good score in GRE and he was among the toppers in our batch. Don't know about others but I have always underestimated him and he has always stood upto the top and proved me wrong. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>No coming to a lighter side, this chap has some strange accent and he never opnes his mouth while speaking. People have leofyed him a lot for the same and he always took it in good spirit. He is a die hard cricket fan and its fun to see him debating him with someone over it. He remembers the exact stats associated with each n every ball that has been bowled till date. His gk is just awesome. He knows so much about evrything that its really hard to beat him. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He has worked his ass off in LTRC and all that has been paid off when he got calls from some big universities.<br><br>I just pray that you'll do great there and will become a great person.<br><br>Good luck and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Net chal raha hai ki nahin ya nal mai paani kyon nahin aa raha, sirf is baat tak ko leke second floor se NBH 50 mai aa tapak ta tha. Kai baar to mai aur kabra used to scare each other arey soja, light off karde, warna mridul aajayega <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But if I say all in one you will never find somebody as helping as mridul. You will never find somebody with so much knowledge about cricket. You will never find anyone as good american accent as him.<br><br>I remember once a night before Maths exam. I could not prepare well. jisse padana tha mujhe ofcourse raman wo khud nahin pad paya tha. I had no option to study myself. Mridul came to room to discuss questions with kabra. Mai iske aksar maze liya karta tha. It just happened that he asked me a question. It was 2AM in the night and paper was scheduled at 8:30 in the morning. He found that I knew nothing and will fail for sure. I requested him to teach me whatever he knows. Despite of that entire maze lena he sat down with me and taught me from that first chapter to last till 5 in the morning. I could not thank him till date. <br><br>Very often we used to argue on silly topics and I enjoy those moments. With this we used to come up with different views to defend ourselves and it was a good excerise.<br><br>Fourth year tak aate aate mridul researcher ban gaya. He published his research paper and second one to go soon. <br><br>Good luck for your future in MS from US and hope soon you receive offer letter from verizon.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>by jove...bande ki gk to aisi hi ki koi bhi fact bolta hai to saamne waala kaise counter kare pata hi nhi chalta...<img src=Smileys/77.gif />....banda ke view pts kafi interesting hote hain....u never get bored when talking to him because ye beech beech main harkate karta rehta hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />....pehle do saal mera padosi tha wing main....aur dhingra ka movie partner <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />....bas mujhe aaj tak samajh nahi aaya ki yeh seedha kyun nahi chalta <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>overall yeh smart, cultured aur urbane type ka banda hai....gud luk dude for ur research...hope u make it big <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mridul ke talent ko agar koi jald hi pahchana toh woh hai dhingra and me..<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Not just GK as what others are referring or simply facts and figures but the perception also he has about different issues,places etc. is that I liked him most.We had a lot of discussions between us,the only thing I like to do when he is with me.<br>Par he has one bad quality too which no one likes that he sticks to his point and then for him others are just like illiterates, improve on it dude...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>Chipakne ka bada shauk hai inhe.Poora group idhar se udhar hila dete hai.Outing ka bada shauk hai par ek trip pe jaane ko tayaar nahi.Jab inka man ho tab hi chalo nahi toh baad mein LTRC ek bahana toh rahta hi hai...<br>Par jo bhi ho iske saath u can enjoy ur outing a lot,with proper facts and figures time to time and some cartoon type magical humor,he become hillarious sometimes.Atleast iske saath u can talk about new things which I like most.Dude thoda apne gusse bhi control kiya karo kabhi kabhi.Take things lite always...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Aur ab thoda compromise karna seekho bade ho gaye ho,Taj ke alawa bhi log rahte hai makano mein...<img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=dhingra.html>Hemant Dhingra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mridul is a typical well mannered,descent guy(which nowadays is a big deal <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).His general knowledge is quite intense and you will be surprised to know the knowledge he possesses.He is a g8 cricket fan and knows so much about the game (only in theory ,practically i don't think he can act even 50% of the things which he say <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).His command over English is very good but still I haven't seen him taking part in any debate (which offcourse you should have done).As far as I know he is the only person among B-tech 4-year guys who is interested in research and want to be a g8 researcher.<br>Dude,I never told you this but the fact is that I have learnt  a lot from you(especially verbal skills).But still I think you could have achieved much more in your college life if you would have expressed yourself more and should have taken part in extracurricular activities.<br>I know that you we will be friends forever and I wish you best of luck for your future(I know you will be successful in whatever you do ..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mridul !!! a awesome smart guy...fun to hangout with...bande ko cricket ke baare mein sab kuch pata hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif />( obviously including Australia)....banda hamesha apna bill badhane mein laga rehta hai........chaiye kahin bhi jao......but really hard working..<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> saari meetings attend ki hai LTRC ki <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> seriously he has worked really hard during his btech so got research paper published and also admission to top ranked universities like johns hopkins and NYU..bande ki GK bhi awesome hai aur english bhi..par sabko samajh nahin aati iski english<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ..in short banda heera hai heera but not very social...isiliye sabko pata nahin hai iska talent...good friend of mine...spent lot of time together bcing....all the best for ur future..post doc karo tum<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>There are only two things that I have heard coming out from his mouth... cricket and LTRC.<br>He feels proud to be a part of LTRC (as it seems to me) and shows it quite often.<br>Although he does good work in linguistics I like to pull his leg and undermine his work. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He emits a strange, eerie and disgusting noise which seems to be his special ability to piss me off, I could have killed him for emitting that noise, but had to retaliate by pestering him with<br>other means that I have at my disposal.<br>But on a serious note, he's totally crazy about cricket and loves to talk for hours on it. He's really ambitious about being a researcher, I wish I had that passion about research.<br>Its also fun talking about linguistics with him. He has mammoth capacity in his brain to remember meaning of words, always amazes me !!<br>What I would like to take from him is his willingness to work hard and his passion towards research, and what I would never take from him is his strange, eerie and disgusting noise which he often makes.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I haven't seen this guy speak during the first year....  Then one day someone spoke something abt cricket in the mess and he started correcting him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...  well this is Mridul, a hardcore cricket fan who likes to read cricinfo and cricbuzz more than watching cricket <img src=Smileys/10.gif />... Well its true... I won't be surprised if he says one day that u can ask him anything abt any of India's matches <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... <br>He likes to go out too...  We had quite a few outings but the problem is that we are never ready for the same place to go <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> and as it turns out his opinion is contradicted by everyone <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> So if we all want to go to dominoes, he will want to go to pizza hut <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but in the end he will accept to go to the place chosen by us due to pressure... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Overall very nice guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and has opinion abt everything in the world... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>Well he is gud in studies too... I took english course with him... and he was extremely dedicated and gud in the subject.... He has worked extremely hard especially in the 8th sem and result can be seen by all...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He got a call from NYU and Johns Hopkins <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>He also has very high IQ and it is very hard to argue with him.... but I manage to do that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( sometimes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>All the best dude...  I hope u are able to get scholarship for these colleges <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
