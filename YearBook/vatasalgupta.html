<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If I have to describe this gem of a person in a few words, what would those words be. Hmmm.<br>Hard working, confused and one hell of an artist. I think this would do justice to Vatasal I know.<br>I was relieved a bit when I saw him sitting in room 119 on first day of my college. A familiar face <br>in an unfamiliar situations always does that you. We hardly interacted in NBH. But when we came to OBH <br>we had fun talking to each other. I got to know more about him. And even now I am not sure how does <br>he manage to have so many female friends with that body <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, it might be a shocking revelation for a few <br>people. Just kidding mate. <br>His dedication and commitment is an inspiration to people around him. His art <br>is creative and distinct with his own touch. He is a real gentleman. <br>He is very fond of watching movies and reading novels. I have, at so many times, borrowed books and his <br>hard disk from him. Quite a taste, I would say. He is one person fun to be with, but only if you know him.<br>For people who dont know him, his first reaction could be repelling.<br>All I want to say to you my friend is that, though I am not the person who is good at giving advice, feel <br>confident in what you do. Because the things that you do are really great and you should believe in them.<br>God be with you. May you bath in happiness and spread cheer around. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part-II<br>The one thing that made me like Vatasal's company in a crowd is that he doesn't take part in BC, some might find it strange but I find no fun in most of the BC that happens (partially bcoz I don't understand it!), and with all the others doing BC, Vatasal and I sometimes have a private conversation as if we were the only two sitting on that table! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I forgot to mention, he does practice guitar once in a while and plays some tunes accurately, like Zombie, Hotel California, Only Time etc.<br>What I would like to take from him is his awesome artistic abilities and ability to bring major changes in one's life and lifestyle!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part-I<br>His father met my father and me before I met Vatasal. Maybe its because of this that even without proper interaction for first two years, I felt that we know each other, although we still don't.<br>It was from third year that I got a chance to interact with Vatasal, when we took the same HSSM, economics, and read POPL together.<br>His room is quite a contrast to my room. It looks packed with stuff but still smells fresh and clean.<br>His wide range of hobbies surprised me at first, but impressed me since then.<br>Although I didn't know Vatasal very well in first two years, I did find a lot of change in him from 3rd year onwards.<br>We've been jogging buddies for about two months in 7th semester. I saw him follow a controlled diet and attend gym, and the change can be clearly<br>seen. He gave me some valuable tips on healthy diet and lifestyle, although I didn't use them! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He is one of the few people who has rarely refused to come with me to Indiranagar when I had some work. And chatting with him is real fun, he keeps himself informed on various subjects like news from economic times, some health and lifestyle related stuff, movies, literature. He also reads a novel once in a while.<br>He suggested me really good books to read, something that directly falls into my field of interest.<br>His t-shirt designs were impressive and so were his pencil sketches, done with a different kind of technique.<br>I still remember those chocolate balls (they were awesomely tasty, I had 3 of them!!) that he gave me, saying it had lots of calories and that he was avoiding too much of calories and fat! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Once in a while we've talked about ourselves minus our college life, that's when I began to understand him better.<br>He's totally interested in finance and economics and reads economic times everyday... I'm sure you'll do great in your career in finance. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He gave me his camera so that I may be able to go for a photowalk with Shrikant and others, although my pics were really bad. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vatasal Gupta, one of the most calm persons in IIIT.....   My first experience of him was wen I was in the lab....  He was helping Saurabh or Khatri in one of the Questions and woh log continously uski maar rahe they but still he was calm.... <img src=Smileys/13.gif />  and he is still that patient....

I felt bad as i made u give that party.... <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ..... Iske rooms par movies bhi bahut dekhi hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... kai saari HD movies rakhta hai  yeh .... agar movies pe kuchh puchna ho toh sahi option hai....<br>Is extremely friendly, helpful and straight forward...... hamesha aise hi rahna..... but Dude thoda jayada baat kiya karo....

<b><a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vatasal Gupta aka vattu is a great frend. He is decent, quiet type, a gentleman, soft-spoken and good at heart.Always ready to help others in any possible way. Is focussed and strives for excellence. Bus thode se confidence ki kami hai<br>aur turant panic mode mein aa jata hai. Baki banda bindaas hai. Movie- freak, loves listening to songs and reading novels and is a branded person..hamesha branded cheejein hi pahanta hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> good.. a down-to-earth guy and you will always feel comfortable in his company... the best thing is ki yeh kabhi bor nahin marta hai..and he always have smthing intersting to tell you..be any new song .. or any new brand-item or smthing.<br><br>Initially we dint talk much..but we really came closer in 5th sem when we took Middleware together. Par isne koi kaam nahin kiya tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> sara maine aur kabra ne hi kiya tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Loves sketching and i think had he not been an enginner, he would have been a gr8 artist. Pahle yeh kabhi mota tha...but ab isne kabhi weight lose kiya hai.. and was really dedicated for that. convinced me to go for jogging for the same and we also went to gym for a few months. Is a gr8 buddy and nice person to hang around. The one thing which I like abt him very much that he never complains abt anything haan kabhi kabhi panic mode mein aa jata hai.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...Aajkal yeh pata hi nahin kya karta rahta hai din bhar apne room mein band ho kar.. poochne pe bolta hai ki mein duniya se upar uth chuka hoon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..bhai neeche aa ja.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. Overall a very nice boy. Do stay in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All the best for your future buddy. May you achieve whatever you want to.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I will skip his tees designing work,his gymming,sketching and girl friends that<br>most of us referred earlier in the testis.Let me write sth else..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Chacha the name I have given him,now with lots of chacha's around at present it has lost its uniqueness but no worries it is still the same among our friends.I have watched so many movies in his room be it in forward mode .. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> or normal <br>mode ..<img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Be it seeing only good scenes <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> or watching my favourite kaat shaat.<br>He is one of the guy in whose room I have spent much of my time. No doubt he is very helping in nature be it borrowing money or pen-drive or dump-bells or credit card or anything, it is this quality that I have learnt from him. We did our ITWS project<br>together and then middleware project, with everytime same question facing who will give the presentation this time<br>..<img src=Smileys/2.gif />  and many assignments mostly in 2nd and 3rd year that we both copied...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We were together in all the hang-outs in our college life. He was very happy initially<br>but with the past two semesters and now he has become somewhat reserved.<br>My message to you is chill dude and ya everyone around you is good just change ur <br>perception to see them ,this is the lesson I have learnt from Alok.Enjoy the way others like to enjoy don't find faults in them. U r among the very hard workers of our batch with last two sems u r more focussed,all the best for ur <br>CFA and BOA. I enjoyed<br>Your distinct sound making ..<img src=Smileys/24.gif />,<br>"bhool gaya" statements with smile...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Number of quick revisions before exams,<br>The serials we watch in summer vacation(heroes,lost) doing night outs, <br>The sweets you brought from your home,<br>Chocolates you brought.<br>Talk about girl firends<br>The laughs we have while doing tete-e-tete together.<br>And lot more....<br>Lets be good friend for years to come.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vatasal, my partner in the EPP presentation last time around. I don't know why he still blames me for speaking for too little time during the presentation. I spoke for more than 15 minutes, plus there was a video at the end of it all <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But mate, thanks a lot for doing a major part of the work- being a little tough for me in that semester <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Vatasal is very talented, especially when it comes to sketching. He is a nice, soft spoken and well mannered chap. Hes got decent acads, and a very well toned body <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He was pretty active for Aakash in the first year, I remember the enthusiasm he showed for the Freshers skit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . However, hes faded over time, and hasn't even put his sketching skills to good use. I loved it when he started designing tees, he did a very good job of it. I think he often has demons about himself and a lot of self-doubts creep in.<br><br>I've enjoyed those BC sessions in the first year (He was my floor mate) and during the EPP course. All the best in life buddy, CAT '09 fod dena. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav memory: All those workouts in the third sem.<br>Message for him: Be more confident about yourself, and you'll have things going your way <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
