<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sahiti, my favourite memories with her are Harsha and me leofying her together in the lab. It was awesome, had loads of fun while doing it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Shes a very cooperative girl, will help you out with whatever. I remember Harsha would often call her up for bailing him out during Felicity <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And she'd smilingly oblige. Shes a fodu at acads, her Google award proves that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Shes a very sensitive girl too.. Back in 1st year, I said things which I shoudn't have, and I am really sorry for that <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>May God bless! Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
