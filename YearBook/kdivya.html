<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>When she's around, I'll just shut up. I won't, cannot and will not be able to open my mouth. She's the Master Blaster, CounterStrike Goddess. She entered Farewell '09 like - "look who's the new chick in town, people!" (I desperately wanna use plural form of some other word instead of 'people' but I'll restrain) Woh my gaad, I shaacked. Good Luck! and btw, you raaaaaack. Saary wraang English, I say! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>What to say about this girl!!! She is one bigggggggg sound-box of the GH 2nd floor... All she needs is some Miss.X (X belongs to ug-2k5 girls) in the wing's corridor or atleast Miss.X's room door open. She just plunges into them with her beautiful <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> "Ooru" slang which irritates<br>the latter the most (atleast "me" the most <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) And do you know what happens if we ask her to stop?? She just gives more of it...<br><br>She generally wakes up very late... rarely has breakfast and very lazy when it comes to getting out of her bed.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Always tries to pull other's legs and can never get bored to chat with someone. She just beats up Anu and Sushu with no reason <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I pity both of them <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>We studied together in 4-1 and she is the one who witnessed me sleeping early the night before the WDKM exam and waking up after she did the next morning... and still she pulls my leg saying I woke up late midnight x-( and studied all the subject and did not even bother to wake her up..Y the damn hell will I do dat Idiot ??? X-(<br><br>Oh yeah..lets now make her feel good by saying few good points about her.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She is always there to help someone in need. She never says a "no" to something we ask for. She has this good habit of asking us if we need something before she goes to the coffeshop <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She helped me many a times with my posts too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>How many good's so far?? 1 2 3 4..omg more than enugh <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Will Miss you divs <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I had so much fun when I am with you... Life is not gonna be the same without you all <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> all the best... you four dualites should keep us posted about all the happenings at IIIT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Divya:<br>The first girl I interacted with in the college. We were in the same group under the mentor,Kiran sir.<br>Once standing outside a lab waiting for Kiran sir to come,she approached me for introduction and I guess that time we <br>became friends. She was and is very good in speaking and she used to put her strong points when we had to speak in discussion forum.<br>Then our friendship goes forward with bidding hi's while walking or passing by. Used to find her in prithvi house related competitions mainly<br>1-2 years but I prefered sports over cultural(I am not good too in it..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) so gave my contribution to house in football only.<br>We had good interactions mainly in our chat sessions or 1-2 times assignments related exchange of words be it algo assignment or social <br>entreprenurship syllabus or anything but sometime general too say about her gao...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. She can be seen on orkut checking her horoscope and <br>writing comments on her friends pic,mostly in telugu...<img src=Smileys/2.gif />.Have often heard about her attitude.But I guess she speaks very soft atleast <br>I didn't find any attitude, may be not much interactions.With our chat slows down to zero.Atleast normal hi's are there...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>No worries,all the best for your MS...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Divya aka k-d adds a kth dimension to the gang of girls. Now I myself don't know what that means... people pull arbit crap, I am also trying something <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Ok... so when I started writing this testimonial, i thought... "ae come on yaar", what should I write about her. Just the other day, while chatting I told her - "Muchchatullu chepukundama?" to which she replied, "adi maa ooru lo sollu kottaram antaru." Half the time, I chat with her 'coz I love the mass language that she uses. Yay! that's one thing I'll remember Divya for. Plus her one-liners. They are so totally witty! Specially the ones targeted at Bhargava, Gopal and Samrat. How often have I tried in the past few weeks to get a balcony ticket to watch this one-liner show <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Unfortunately I've only managed dress circle tickets which means I'm also in the targetlist <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Though we used to talk pretty often in first yr., about all sorts of arbit things (she has awesome english + a great voice which makes her a very good speaker) but we lost the connection in the subsequent years and in fourth year, I came to know about her in totally different light. I'm sure I'll know a lot more about her. Here's wishing her all the best in whatever activity she takes up. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>KD the sweet rowdy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> always in the highest excitation state and more energy!! <br><br>To be frank I never had the chance of interacting with her more till my 3rd yr. We used to play badminton almost everyday and it was a real fun to be with her. But I dont know what happened later she became busy and we stopped playing <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> She is the best trainer in a way I shud say <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>She is an owl <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> and always we can see her going to bed early in the morning and we can again see her may be around 8 or 9 in the evening in the mess <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Srry of course she attends classes <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) We went to comad and in the trip it was so funny to be with her... always keeps cracking jokes and one thing I like in her is the way how she presents herself(dressing) in any situation. Never try to imitate and she is stylish in her own way!! go buddy!!<br><br>Very intelligent girl <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The most hilarious event happened with her was the time she took to travel from her house to IIIT in mid may last yr in the HOTTEST SUMMER <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> lol<br><br>All the best KD!! We'll have gr8 fun for one more yr da!!<br><br>Luv u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Divya - the first gal i met @ IIIT ... it was during the so called "interaction" on day 1... i actually had to tell my bio-data corrrectly to her n she made me tell it 26 times, finding mistakes each time ... yup ... two six ... n finally i begged her to lie to seniors that i told it correctly  .... i was very much frightened that day thinkin that will every1 be like this in IIIT ? <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.... uff ... finally found she was the only ONE <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>and then she helped me a lot in improvin my english ...  with her english notes n tips n fundas ... then v became good friends ... also had many ups n downs in our friendship bcoz v both "were" very short-tempered .. it was very fun teasin her each time ... especially during first year(horror n scary movies) ...<br>one more most admirable quality is "sense of humour" and dedication ... dedication to novels, movies n ya .. "TV shows" ..... bit psychic in this case <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... <br>she is bit crazy about things n very stubborn .. chahiye hi chahiye ...<br>she was also d direct link for me to GH <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... any assignments or notes on any subject or details, needed from any1 over there, she was always there ....  had a great n smooth stay @ IIIT .. i owe part of it to her .... she also gave me lot of <b> gyan </b>in first year .. it was great n bit annoying at times having a friend like u .. keep rockin buddy ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She used to live beside by room in first year...but coz of different sections never actually got to know her ...but she is sweet and smiles every time you greet her...generally meet her in yuktahaar where she is always pulling someone's leg <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... quite cool abt acads... reading novels...playing wiht cell phone is most part of it...well she sleeps too <img src=Smileys/4.gif />...recently in one of the Venky's class..when he shouted her name thrice <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />...sings well too....<br><br>All in all a fun loving girl...with ultra cool attitude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The happy-go-lucky girl with good sense of humor. Is good at pulling legs of people and is constantly doing that for every other person she meets <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Speaks her heart out and is a walking question bank. Be it a status message, cricket match or exam, the number of questions she asks is equal to the amount you can spend answering them. Has this addiction for tv shows. And yeah, She watches only English movies <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>all the very best for ur future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers,<br>rohit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>            Baaaaaaaavaaaaaa... Thats exactly how I greet her - be it in a solemn class, in mess, at 4 AM in the night when she comes back from her looong walks with oh-so-many fans <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .. KD is a clown <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>           I cannot forget the scene we had to do during our ragging incidents. It was then that we spoke for the first time, before that it was just smiles exchange.. She was the guy (as always, it just suits her somehow <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) , and I was this innocent girl being pestered by her.. OMG we both were so terrible at our roles, that seniors actually walked away asking us to atleast attempt to do good <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. I ,ladies and gentlemen was <b>the </b> one to confer the name <b><i>"BAVA"</i></b> to her for a reason of course.  The reason is soo slender and soo delicate that <b>he</b>..oops i mean it cannot be mentioned here <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>        Its great fun when we get together.. We laugh, pull each others' legs, have crushes on others' boy friends and plan to .. well.. we are nice people by heart so nothing wrong in planning and not executing them.. We always had (and have even now <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )a lot of overlap in our crush list.. We fight, we reach an agreement, the list changes and we fight again <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Its fun.. <br><br>        She introduced me to F.R.I.E.N.D.S, 70s show, HIMYM and to all the TV shows which I so ardently follow.. She hates me for barging into her room sometimes without notice.. She hates me for being behind her to switch off the lights and fans but all these extremely minisculer things apart, she is an amaaaaaazing girl to be with and I daresay, I cannot find a <i>bandi</i> who is on par with me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and sometimes I repeat only sometimes (see, I am just being so nice to you!) a little better than me in sarcasm and jokes.. <br><br>        I dream of an apartment full of our gang re..And in that, you are my neighbor.. Your house should be filled with 'teendi' (like that of Monika's) so that I come and eat off all that <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. Food apart, I really wish we all can stay together always.. love you a lot <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> I think its only apt to start this testimonial with a lol because that is what happens when you meet KD. Perhaps the funniest,wittiest girl I have ever met and a delightful company, she is someone who approaches things with a carefree attitude that I can only appreciate <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. We used to speak a lot in the first year but somehow our conversations shifted to a casual smile or a hi during the second and third years. But we have more than made up for all those lost conversations this semester and all those chats have been extremely funny and personal at the same time!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>      She has these unique facial expressions alongwith the most sarcastic of tones and if there ever were a female Chandler, it would be her. Will never ever forget that awesome recording session in my room where KD's true talents and tastes came out <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All the best for your future goals (and I mean the non-academic ones too <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and loads of love and good wishes <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>KD .. Well, I didn't speak to her properly till last month .. and all of a sudden, after Felicity, she became a very close friend of mine . OMG! She's got a wonderful sense of humor. Some people of my wing (I'm not taking any names here) are actually afraid of her coz she can kill them with her sarcasm and humor and all they can do is sit quietly and pray to God to stop her. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> while all others just <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Sometimes you won;t even understand that you got blasted! She can shut anybody;s mouth. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> coz she always has a very strong point/trump card up her sleeve to win the debate. sometimes behaves like a gunda too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Are you frightened? I was just kidding. That's how she is from outside. But she's very caring, jolly, friendly and a very outspoken person in reality <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. I never felt bored in her company even though I've known her for only a few days now. Some people leave such an impression. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>She's the one who uses "Ya" very frequently in an awesome tone. My X roomie is just fida on her style of saying "Ey! Come on Ya" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Infact me too. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Btw, never saw her reading/studying, So I dunno how she;s @ studies, but since she;s a girl, she must be very dedicated and hardworking. (Pure guess. No previous knowledge <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>So here goes a testi to the girl with the shortest nick (kd). <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers to our friendship and all the best for your MS and future as well. Be in touch and haan nevr ever let your sarcasm die. Me a big fan of your sarcasm. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>DJ.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This girl is a complete crack. She is both-beauty and the beast.Believe me, She has got all those qualities which can drive anybody mad. Stands first in cracking jokes <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and if there's someone who doesnt find them funny, he should consult a doctor. She is high most of the times but certainly has mood swings as we all do. Gets angry really soon and calms down equally fast. Looks very cute when she cries,cuter when she is ok and cutest when she smiles. Her comebacks are mostly one-liners which set us laughing like pigs. She's also smart and has a good brain but barely uses it. She likes "CHILL"ed guys and often bugs me(rather insults me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) about my taste. She looks equally deceptive because a person who sees her for the first time would think she is a real geek and is very silent. I still remember the first day when I asked her name, she merely said "Divya" and I cursed myself for meeting a boring person. Later, I was taken aback when she spoke to me and am still surprised how she manages to strike a good conversation with anyone and keep it interesting till the end. She hardly talks to guys! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Overall, she is certainly that one person everyone would love to be with.
