<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>There is one guy in our batch who laughs for anything and everything. And he is so famous at that that he's called with a nick which has "laughing" preceded to his name. It seems his portrait is the correct replacement to <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> smileys. And, that, ladies and gentlemen, is Laughing Kiran alias Kirku alias Matamaiah alias Mabbugadu alias Cloud Boy alias Despo Kiran.<br><br>He's a concoction of a hard-working and a talented guy you could rarely find. He's been shortlisted for interviews for more than quarter century of companies in our placements<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Do I need to say anything about it? Perfint Tech should be damn lucky to hire this "kasi" guy for such a low pay. Unlike other guys in our batch who do projects and assignments just for the sake of it, he's a real researcher -- whom IIIT-H should be proud of.<br><br>One could easily mistaken him for an innocent, calm and innocuous guy judging by his looks and the way he talks. There is another angle to him other than this; that only we know -- his "despo" angle. That "milk joke" you and Goti have cracked is a testimony to your "despo"ism. The way you cursed your late grandfather for not doing your marriage was awesome. Wait for some more years dude... don't be too eager, anxious and desperate to get married and dash-dash-dash!<br><br>I couldn't and won't forget the way you (in collaboration <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> with Goti and Ram) entertained us in NBH mess all these days<img src=Smileys/3.gif />. The 3rd sem in which we (Sana, You, Pappa and I) used to read dash-dash-dash stories were the awesome-est moments I spent in GHEB. Wish those days come back again. And the dialogue "maa pappa eppudoo room lone untadu!"<img src=Smileys/21.gif />, the "annayyaki gnanodayam"<img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and the "good morning teacher"<img src=Smileys/24.gif /> episodes!! I'll never forget in my life. <br><br>All the best for your future ra...<br><br>PS1: When are you going to propose your <i>paapa</i> dood? Do it at the earliest without delaying any further!<br>PS2: You're my favorite pillion ra!<br>PS3: Gadwal sambandham yedivaraku ochindi?</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[contd] Add to thess infinite nite outs v had together playin cards , monopoly , pluckin mangoes lyk tarzans .. Nd rememeber da Manikonda trip whr v set off to discover the xact boundary of manikonda ?  <br>  <br>          Veediki aa "laughing kiran " tag tagilinchinde nene ..

<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>    In my childhood i used to stare at the beautiful sky nd used to wish " I wish i cud wander among those clouds " .. God obliged to ma wishes nd sent me this sincere `cloud` who has been wid me for 6 years now nd last four years of ma college life wud hav been without much motivation if Kirku hadnt been around .. The sincerity nd commitment nd dedication he shows during ane work r truly commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .. (deenine IIIT lo kasi antaru )..I am the direct witness of all dose nite outs he had done for Gsoc code wid Asanka (his mentor ) nd Vam ,, "Veediki entha Kasi ante first year lo bathroom lo baaga batting chesi kallu tirigi padipoyadani oka talk ".. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>     Einstein said "I think therefore i am " ..For Kirku its lyk " I over think , therefore i am a cloud " <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. He thinks deeply into ane matter nd sometimes gets lost in his own web of thoughts,, <br>          Kirku : "Re .. monna ground lo keka batting chesadra ,, vaade match ni gelipinchaadu "<br>          Goti : "Evadu be vaadu "<br>          Kirku 2 min srs gaa alochinchi <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>          Kirku : "Nene ra " <br>          Goti  , Ram : <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>     But this character of analysis is wat makes him stand out .. I seriously appreciate the way he shrug off the notions he had wen he came to the college nd broad mindedly adapted nd evolved .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> But all this work doesnt mean he is busy all the time .. he has ample time for the insanity v shared during all da nite outs at goutham's adda ('baathu' room) .. The common thing dat used to happen in 4th year was <br>          Kirku : "Ee ra .. em chestunnav be ?"<br>          Ram : "Khaali ee ra..Paa ..poyi baathu gaadini kelukudam"<br>          Me to Goti : "Orey elanti panicheddam ante ippati varaku evaru chesi undakudadu ,, future lo kuda evaru cheyyakudadu "<br>    Nd this way wud begin our long nites in whch v wud watch loads of insane movies , speak hours of arbit crap nd wat not ..

This geeky boy displays his geekiness in studies and at the same time displays his mabbutanam in nething which is not related to studies (very conflicting indeed<img src=Smileys/3.gif />).<br>he is the king of despos (second comes vasana chaitanya). no matter what he does, he always thinks of just 1 thing, "when will i get married"<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. he fumes on his tata for getting married so early and praises his avva for encouraging him to marry. he is a strong believer of "boys shud get married by 21" ( neeku edo sambandham vachindani talk vastundi ra nijamena)<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>  he is an ideal student. he doesn't forget his manners, wishes to his teachers no matter what he is doing..<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>  he is an ideal brother(anna) lecturing his brother on **xual awareness<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> (dude just make sure that no one else is in the house while doing such things, i wish i cud see ur face at that instant..)<br>  he is an ideal son..promised his father in 4th class that he will pursue his phd (after all he is a born geek)<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kiran was my roomie in my first year. And I have no complaints with that, he was a very cooperative roomie. They call him, "Laughing Kiran", and the name could not be more apt. You would never see him fighting with anyone- If we had any issues, we'd always settle it amicably. In fact, hes so adjusting that we hardly had any issues. One memory which I have is after the DLD grades came out. As soon as he came to the room, he congratulated me heartily and praised me. That was because I had managed an 'A'. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is a hardworking and dedicated guy. He also plays decent cricket, he did come for the house practise sessions in the first year, but never after that.<br><br>Wish you all the best in life!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
