<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Apni testimonial padh kar laga ki soni ne kuch extra hi tarif kar de hai...itna bhi nahi tha...<br><br>Soni is an all-rounder, talented and intelligent. He can play any game. He can sing <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and dance. He is always excited about trying new things. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Hamesha masti ke mood mein rehta hai...hamesha  matlab hamesha...koi bhi situation ho soni joke mar sakta hai...hum dono kabhi-kabar kise ki bahut utarte the...amazon mein narendra ko bahut pareshan kiya...par woh bhi ultimate banda hai...we will never forget the time we spent with him...<br><br>Soni bahut jyaada alsi hai...actually kuch jyaada hi hai...kabhi-kabar isse karan hamara thoda jhagda ho jaata tha...par thats all a part of life...actually aalas bhi ajeeb tarah ka hai...you would think banda games khelta hai aur bahut acha khelta hai, then how is he alsi? Its like: agar baitha hai toh uthane ke liye bahut mehnat karni padti hai, par agar uth gaya to phir gazab ki energy show karta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />...<br><br>He is a party-guy. Soni ki company mein koi bhi fultu enjoy kar sakta hai. Khane-pine aur ghoome ke shaukeen hai. Banda dil ka acha hai. Taraaki karega <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....<br><br>Best wishes <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and lots of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ninja ki jai ho...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is a simple, sober person. Par tayaar hone mein kam se kam ek ghanta toh lagta hi hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He is an upright person <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Par chutiyapen bhi bahut karta hai.<br><br>He is a man of principles <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Par principles kahan chale jaatein hain jab ladki dekh jati hai.<br><br>He doesn't believe in any form of discrimination. Par first year walon se pocho.<br><br>He does a laudable amount of selfless social service (through Yuktahaar). Par yuktahaar mein koi aata hai, joh sirf yuktahaar me hi khata hai.<br><br>He is looking for ladylove. Par koi list toh dekho <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Jo bhi hai, ninja great hai. Upar wale sentences mein 'Par' ke aage jo bhi likha hai, sab maze ki liye hai (lekin thoda-thoda sach bhi hai) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>In first year, ninja mujhe itna pasand nahi tha. Par slowly-slowly, while working for yuktahaar, I realized ninja kya hai. Now I can say with certainty - He is the person whom I respect most in IIIT and I firmly believe that a lot of people can really look upto him to find what courage really is and what does it mean by walking the talk <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He is truly and really a man of principles. His ideas, beliefs may seem outdated, but I agree with most of them.<br><br>Bhagwan kare jaldi se iska passport ban jaye, aur koi list ko satisfy karne wali mil jaye (halaki probability bahut kam hai).<br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>part 2<br><br>Ghoomne ka, shopping karne ka bahut shauk hai. Mujhe bhi expert bana diya hai. Bahut kuch sikha hai maine - jo ladki ko shopping kara de, uske toh pair padne chahiye  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Dresses ka collectio kafi acha hai. Up-to-date rehne mein vishwas rakhti hain. Kise aur ka naya dress dikha nahi ki inhe bhi naya dress chahiye <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>This might seem surprising, but hamare tastes bahut different hain. I hardly care what I am wearing but she does. I really care what I am eating but she doesn't. Main bahar khane ki liye jaata hoon woh ghoomne ke liye. Main bahut slow kaam karta hoon, woh bahut fast. I am lazy - never on time in classes, she is right on time always. Our approch towards solving a problem is also entirely different <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Meri saari tension wahi lete hai. She helps me with everything. We have taken several crazy career-related decisions together in the past (more craziness was on my part) and went back on them. We were never sure what to do, but anyway tried several things with enthusiasm. Had she not been there, it would have been a very heavy, monotonous life in B.Tech. Without her help I wouldn't have arrived at the final decision. She has supported me all the way, good times, bad times.<br><br>Best wishes... and always 'be' there...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Shikha mere se kafi dino se naraaz ho rakhi hai. Poochti hai abhi tak testimonial kyun nahi likha. Naraazgi toh jayez hai. Soch raha hoon kafi time se kya likhon: only so much can words say <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> However, lets make a start.<br><br>part 1<br><br>Let me start by saying: shikha apni shikha se sabko khush kar dete hai. She has loads of energy, talks with infinite enthusiasm. There is no dull moment when she is around. She is a fun-loving girl. Meri saari baatein, saari problems, sab sunte hai.<br><br>Needless to say, she is brilliant. It often happens that she asks me to explain something or solve a problem for her. While I think of the possible solution/explanation, she would come up with her own in a matter of minutes, surprising me. She is the one who attends every lecture on time and prepares notes. There have been some hard subjects/topics...par ham library mein ghanto bhaite rehte, kaise bhi dheere-dheere kar lete.<br><br>Pakar-pakar bahut karte hai. Bandi ko iske liye award diya jaa sakta hai. Par ek baat jaroor kahoonga, agar chup ho jati hai tu man nahi lagta <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Padh ke shayad aur pakar na karne lage). Tension bhi kabhi-kabar le leti hai. Exam mein, interview mein thoda tense ho jati thi par ab theek hai.<br><br>Bahut jaldi kise se dosti ho jati hai - saari baatein sunti hai aur saari bata bhi dete hai. Kai ladke interested hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Na zaane kahan kahan se kab kab pyaar bhare sms bhejte rehtein hain <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br><br>IIIT mein kafi achievements kamayein hain. Google, Microsoft, IIM interview calls, parliament member, pata nahi kya kya. Par shikha wahi hai jo 1st year mein aaye thi - who used to sit beside me.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Aur bhai khurana...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Maine shayad hi kabhi ise Saurav kahaa ho. Shayad hi kise aur ne kahan ho <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is known and feared <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> as khurana.<br><br>Agar main ise sincere, hard-working, punctual kahoonga toh naraaz ho gayega <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Par koi nahin, ab toh keh hi diya. But there is one more way to look at it: he is an inspiring individual. His personality seems to say - have faith in yourself and you will be able to do anything in this world <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He enjoys to the fullest. When he is enjoying, he is enjoying. Cracks great jokes sometimes and sometimes really great ones. All in all he adds to the fun.<br><br>Bande ki achi knowledge hai aur strong opinions hai. He can manage things well and will be a great asset for whoever he works for.<br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Aditya ki wah bhai wah...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Yeh mere saath rehne wala hai isliye iske sirf tarif hi karoonga <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Bande ki body-shody hai aur mast smart hai. Main isko hamesha bolta hoon utha dena main bhi body banaonga, par kehta hai - main nahi tujhe uthaonga <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Mujhe uthana majaak thode hi hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Room itna saaf reha hai jitna bhagwan ka mandir nahi rehta hoga. Choice classic hai. Har ek item ekdum best. TT khelne ka apna style hai. Dar lagta hai jab shot marta hai - par mast shots marta hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Koi bhi occasion ho, aditya enjoys himself and adds to the fun. Bande ki memory ki dag dene padege <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Andar kya photocopy machine chalti hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I look forward to having a great time with him.<br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harsh failaye harsh...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Banda intelligent aur multi-talented hai. Thode time mein pata nahi kitne cheeze manage kar leta hai, aur phir bhi masti kar leta hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Hum kahein bhi jayen, koi bhi problem ho, harsh ko bol do aur light lo. He will manage. He is always ready to help <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Classes mein hamesha time par jaata hai aur khoob saare doubts poochta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is a very good speaker and a nice negotiator. I firmly believe that he will be very successful as a manager. While working on the rally, he gave the best from his side. Without him, it wouldn't have been possible <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Thoda alsi hai - shayad jyaada bhi hai. Par koi pareshani ho, toh phat se solve kar deta hai. Mast enjoy karta hai.<br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Wah agrawal ji...wah...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is a perfectionist. Jis cheez mein man lage jaye, ekdum perfection tak karta hai. Bande ke saare item selected hote hain. Room hamesha chaka-chak, har cheez sahi jagah par. Inhe richeek bahut pasand hai. Dono room-mates ki ultimate bonding hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  Hamesha riceek ki utarta rehta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I came to know him the day our first C assignment was given. I wanted to complete it on the first day itself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> but I wasn't sure about the last question. I felt no-one would have done all the questions. However, during dinner someone told me that th<br>ere is one guy who has done all. I was really surprised and wanted to meet him urgently. Our first meeting was on this day an<br>d I was immediately impressed <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> As time passed, more assignments came. We used to discuss a lot of questions. He is perhaps<br>the first person in IIIT I became fan of.<br><br>He is very sharp, can solve questions in few minutes on which you would bang your head for hours. Has a knack for solving puz<br>zles, sudoku, and other interesting stuff - faster than you could imagine <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Also, has a great sense of humor and excellent timing. He likes trying out new things - new food items, new places. Is advent<br>urous and open to new ideas <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Adarniya Richeek ji ko shashank ka namaskar...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Aisa roz subah uthkar do bar kar lena chahiye, patah nahi maibaap ko kab gussaaaaa aa jaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Richeek ka bhai awesome sense of humor hai, aur mast timing hai. Banda cool rehta hai (in general). TT mast khelta hai aur ultimate shots marta hai. Hamare liye yeh bade bhai ka roop hain <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>GRE ke time inme teeno D charam par the - dedication, devotion aur determination. Bande ne gazab phoda hai. He took the path which few people choose. One thing which I really like about him is - he won't do what he doesn't want to do and is not fearful of trying to find out where his heart lies <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Hum saath mein bahut bhagein hain. And I don't know whether he realizes or not, but when he starts doing something on a regular basis, he only gets better with time - be it TT or bhagne ka stamina. He doesn't give up easily - tries his best. And this attitude of his will help him achieve the greatest of heights <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=yogendra.html>Yogendra Umesh Itankar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Yo se yogo...Lovely yogo...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Yogo is very sweet. He looks at the good side of people. Simple banda hai - enjoy karta hai. Its easy to make him laugh, and he laughs so heartily that it makes everyone around happy. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I would never forget one incident - actually accident. It left marks on both of us. Culprit was obviously me. We were returning from a lunch buffet and I had a class at IIIT, so was driving very fast and carelessly. Yogo cautioned me a hundred times against doing so but I didn't listen to him. Unfortunately, when we slipped I had nothing to say. We were bleeding all over. I thought Yogo will scold me like hell. But inspite of the excruciating pain, he kept his cool. Didn't say even a single word to me, not even an angry look. On the contrary, when he found that I was feeling guilty, he said, "Abe ho jata hai". Hats off to you man <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> At least in this life, I would never forget this accident.<br><br>Apan dono thode research type bande hain isliye mast baatein kartein hain. Kaye cheezon mein view point bhi match karta hai. Jab main kise ki buraaye karta hoon toh yogo khoob hasta hai. I really enjoy talking to him. Concepts bande ke katlimate hain. Classic samajhata hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Yogo has lappy aur uska gussa, dono hi bahut khatarnaak hain. Dono se bach ke rehna chahiye <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Best wishes and lot of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Subo bhai awesome hai...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Koi bhi tension, pareshani ho, ya masti karne ho, bas subo ke room pe pahuch jaata hoon. He is a great guy with a great sense of humor. Bahut lazy bhi hai aur bhagwan jaane kitna slow chalta hai (but he manages to bowl very well...). Movies dekhne ka bahut shauk hai, aajkal telugu dekh raha hai. He is good at academics, one among the toppers of ECE <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Bandan tension nahi leta hai, light leta hai. Pata nahi kitne saare log (from every batch of IIIT) isse milne aatein hain. People love to talk to him - so friendly is he <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Kabhi-kabhi mar bhi khane padti hai, jaise holi par <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Ladkiyon ka poora database hai bande ke pass <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Aur likhonga toh mar padege. Lekin ek baat toh hai - bahut kam hi ladkiyaan hai jinper ise crush NAHI hai. Bhagwan iska bhala kare - isko jaldi se koi mil jaye.<br><br>Hamesha help karne ke liye tayaar rehta hai. Kabhi-kabhi raat ko bahut bhook lagte hain, toh subo bhai kuch na kuch arrangement kar dete hai.<br><br>Best wishes and lot of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
