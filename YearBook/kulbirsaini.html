<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>ahh. finally writing a testimonial to one of my favorite friends.<br><br>He is sooo cool. Talking to him once could reveal this. Dude you rock in many ways. I inspired a lot from you. Sometimes I tried to copycat you. You are so amazing. <br><br>I don't think you remember this. I played my first TT game with you. You and I were newbies to the game. I don't know how you play now but still I am the same.<br><br>The thing which I like in him is clarity. Whatever he talk there is so much clarity in it. He provided a lot of moral support to me during my networks tutorial. I too started earning money these days taking you as inspiration. That was one of the reasons I applied to GSOC.<br><br>Keep rocking. Bye. Miss you<br><br><img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>I know you've got a great future ahead of you and will go a long way to the top. Keep in touch.<br><br>Best Memories: Reinstalling Fedora in first year, hacking people's passwords <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, AOE in first year, summer 2007 CZ and BC everyday. <br>Will Miss you for: <b>Awesome one-liners</b>.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Kulbir Saini, A.K.A. General Bordeaux A.K.A. ($) Chacha.<br><br>He's THE greatest geek of our batch. Extremely knowlegable in Networks and Linux, and he's the one to contact if you have any troubles with the same. Although he has a sticker outside his room saying, Only Fedora - Please dont come for windows XP doubts <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He's very intelligent and determined guy and always works with a plan. Although he doesnt care about his GPA, but he has earned more than anybody in our batch during the college stay itself. He started in first year just like me and many others who didnt have much exposure with computers, but in mere 2 years he knew more than anybody else about Linux and various hardware. 3-1 mein ake inko Networking ka bhoot chadha and he started learning networks day and night <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Or maybe its partly due to no desktop in his room and having only one book at his room <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He soon became the student system administrator at IIIT <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>He was also one of the few friends that I had in my first year, he lived in GHEB, was from Vayu house <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, and had similar interests in computers as me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Remember that little shell script we guys worked on to hack peoples students passwords and the mess it created <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He also used to play AOE with me and he's pretty good strategy wise in the game. I also remember him reinstalling fedora in his pc 2 times a day <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Apart from being a geek, He's also very witty and comes with awesome one-liners. Logo ki maarne mein expert hai and thats the reason isse koi pange nahi leta. About being called chacha, its because He is always RIGHT, everyone else who doesnt agree with him will be considered as ch***** <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He's one of the great BCbaaz in our batch and I will remember you for those countless BC sessions that we had together <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>He's passionate about blogging and maybe photography ( recently after he bought his new camera <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). Also brags about the number of hits per day and the page rank of his website(s) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Kulbir aka Chacha aka Dollar Chacha</u><br><br>You keep hearing stories about people, who when came to college knew nothing about computers but when they left it, they were Gods of Computers and this chap is one of them. <b>Linux God, Networks freak</b>, his life in IIIT seemed to be concentrated around these two things and he has done quite well for himself, academically as well as financially.<br><br>Another facet to his personality is BC. The guy does BC, BC and BC, one of the biggest BCbaazs. He is quite famous for leofying people, its like one of his favourite activity, kabhi bhi kisi ko nahin chhodta kabhi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Another person who is passionalte about blogging and who always finds out time to blog (given his busy schedule <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) Jab se chacha ke hath mein camera aa gaya hai, tab se to jab bhi chacha bahar jate hain poori duniya ko uski khabar ho jati hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Raat ko ate hi sari photos chacha ke blog pe <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> All in all a nice to guy to be with <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Jab tak tumhari na mare <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> )<br><br>Wishing you all the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>General Bordeaux... he's someone who scares me sometimes (don't mind! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) because he always seems to speak direct and in a subtle manner, have never managed to argue with him. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> He's a great BCbaaz.<br>On the positive side, he's an extremely nice person... apart from being master of linux, and helping me solve my linux problems, he is also an awesome blogger. His blogs are like him, direct, subtle, simple yet the intended effect can be experienced. I love reading his posts.<br>Also, he's great at gaming, in CZ and AOE.<br>Although you have so many qualities of a nerd, the word "nerd" doesn't suit you... you're General Bordeaux. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Why do they call you chacha, BTW? <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>Looking great in the pic, BTW. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for the future, I'm sure it'd be better though not the same as these college days. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kulbir Saini aka Chacha aka Dollar bhai<br><br>Is bande ke liye bahut jyada respect hai mere dil mein. Chaar saal tak isne sirf apne interest par kaam kiya hai aur aage bhi karne vala hai. Baki cheezon ki sabki aisi ki taisi, ye nahi karne vala. I seriously admire him for what he is doing and the way he is doing that. Linux mein isse bada bond nahi dekha hoga.  Bcbaaz bhi hai bahut bada. Har ek ki leta rehta hai poore time. Volleyball to alag hi tarah se khelta hai. Poora Haryanvi jor iska volleyball mein nazar aata hai. CS bhi jab bhi khelo ye banda join karta hi hai. Coffee Shop iska mandir hai. Har time vahin par milega ye banda. This guy is damn intelligent and hard-working. His placement in Rediff is a testimony to this fact. I wish you all the luck for ur future buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hope you start a company and that becomes a big hit some day. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kulbir always used to wear this red t-shirt with <b>Bomb Hacker<b> printed on it, to the English class. Although some me told about his commitment to become a great hacker, I could not never really imagine that a thin, lanky Hariyanwi Chacha would become one of the networking greats at IIIT-H. <br><br>He is highly passionate about networks Linux and Open Source. However unlike most of the FOSStards, he has a penchant for making money for his work <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> His nickname, <i>Dollar Bhai</i> is a testimony to that. You will hardly find a fosstards with such sensibility. I appreciate that. <br><br>Though we are poles apart coming to our views on Microsoft : ) However we share the same view about software industry and its power in general. <br>Apart from a networking great, he is one of the most vocal guys of the batch. Taking digs at others is one of his favourite pastimes. <br><br>I could not possibly fathom who he's gonna be in the future - Next Richard Stallman/Eric Schimdt/Larry Page. But definitely he is gonna make it real big in life. <br><br>Keep in touch!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He's skinny, he's witty, he's damn intelligent, he's chacha.<br><br>If anyone asks you your name just tell them "Chacha. Dollar Chacha". In James Bond style <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But saala.. you don't have that physique be.<br><br>Chacha is one of the foduest guys of our batch who doesnt give a fu*k about grades and acads but is very dedicated to whatever he's doing. In workspace his PC was just beside mine and we used to do many <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> things. We used to play pranks with shrikant by creating some new Orkut A/c's and all. Back then he had an awesome moustache <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He looked like an uncle <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. That was chacha in 1st year.<br><br>But today chacha is so different. This year RnD showcase was like a perfect bull's eye for this guy. His project was so admired by the Rediff guys that they offered him job with just a nominal interview. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to you bro. That was a great achievement.<br><br>When we were preparing questions for cache in, chacha comes in and anwsered all the questions in one go and asked us to put every question in level 1(do you remember?) and then would laugh his ass off looking at the level of the questions. Chacha yaar, sab tumhare jaise intelligent nahi hote bhai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Oops! I forgot to mention the most most important word without which my testi is worthless. Chacha is a <b>linux</b> g33k and always helds a helping hand to those who know nothing about linux. He had an opportunity to work under the guy who started YUM in <b>GSoC</b>. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>And now these days, one can see chacha doing full time BC near the coffee shop. Pulling everyone's leg, commenting on others and showing  witty/sarcastic side of himself. I love your sarcasm chacha. Also I love to read your blog. Your posts are awesome!!<br><br>All the very best for your future endeavours chacha. Humein mat bhulana.<br><br>Love.<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Chacha is one of the greatest bonds of our class. He is damn good at Web technologies, Linux and all geeky stuff <img src=Smileys/77.gif />....We did not talk much in the first year...But we came close in the second year when he became my neighbour in cellar. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Chacha ka favourite kaam hai- kisi ki bhi maarna <img src=Smileys/3.gif />... Koi bhi mauka nahi chhodta kisi ki maarne ka... Aur second favourite Coffee shop jaana... Isne pure B.Tech mein jitne der classes lagayi hogi usse jyada CS pe time bitaya hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif />... BC maarne bhi ye banda kabhi piche nahi rehta.... Bahot bada nautanki hai... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>The best thing about him is he never cares about anything and he does only thing which he enjoys doing. I feel he is one of the greatest achievers of our batch...Google Summer of code, Video cache, working with some of the greatest developers of Open Source, Various offers from startups, Airvana and Rediff......And the list of achievements is never ending <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />...I wish it never ends and you add many more achievements to your list <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>I feel honoured when he used to tell me about the things he is working, his plans (Which he seldomly discloses to others <img src=Smileys/3.gif />)... We used to discuss lot of techie ideas in Yuktahaar..... Page rank hacks..... Isne to baba ko bhi frustoo kar diya tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif />..... Then he gets many ideas about starting business...<br><br>He is passionate blogger as well.....Never misses a chance to write a blog on any event ( Page rank jo badhani hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).... He never cares about studies and grades.... He becomes happy even with 'D' <img src=Smileys/13.gif />... Aur jab bhi iska room partner rota tha ki uska 'F' aayega...Chacha uske itne maje leta aur confirm kara deta ki pakka tera 'F' aayega <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...Waise inki jodi sabse great thi...."Ojasvi and Chacha".... Bhai kaise nikale honge woh do saal ojasvi ne aur chacha ne ek dusare ke saath... <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part2</b><br>In third sem he got Windows on his system....Uske baad bhai kya games kheli bande ne...aur har baar exam ke pehle koi nayi game install karta tha...taaki baaki log bhi na padhe....Relative grading jo hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ...

A unique piece of our college <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Chacha is famous for his knowladge of linux and his witty comments. I came in touch with him thru vigla. 1st yr me Chacha ki kya mooche thi. chacha dance karta hai ..to aisa lagta hai jaise dharti par pralay aane wali hai thodi der me <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . A totally moody insan....When he wants to do something ..nothing can stop him. <br>Chacha se koi pehli bar bat karega to wo yahi samjhega ki dunia ka sabse sensible insan yahi hai....lekin kuch he din me usi ke samne usko "ch****" bol dega or prove bhi kar dega <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. IIIT me sayd he koi insan hai jiske lie chache ne ye word na use kiya ho <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br>Never seen him tensed for academics....also a true follower of coffee shop like me ... his day doesn't complete without going coffe shop. And coffee shop paid him back by rediff interview on coffee shop. Chacha Special occassions par he nahata hai. One thing I really appreciate of him is .... he is always clear what he have to o....doesn't divert in between. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Keep it up chache.<br>Or bandio ke mamle me to krishna kanahiya hain .... na jane kitni chachi hain IIIT me ...kai bar to confusion ho jata hai ki kis chachi ki bat chal rahi hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . A true BCBaaz...those BC sessions in yuktahar and coffee shop are really unforgettable. Cache Video prank on 1st april....<br>i can't forget that day. One incident I remember .... we were watching 'Vivah' in motorola .... chache ke comments se log itna hase jitna kisi comedy movie me bhi nahi haste <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . <br>Chache tere bina sari BC incomplete lagti hai. Also You hv proved that CGPA doesn't matter ...knowladge matters. Overall he is really sensible, funny ,witty , hard working <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ( Only if he is interested <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) and fun loving guy. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Now this is a big thing for chaacha...  He was famous in our lab for a lot of installations, a title which was taken away from him by Dandu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But our real introduction happened when I came to cellar...  now lemme clarify a few things, chaacha is a very gentle person when he is talking to someone he doesn't know but as soon as you become acquainted you have to get used to a particular word which he likes a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...  I got to listen to that word a lot like everyone else....

'what happened to him' .. for he was falling all over the places.. seeking the shoulders for support... we got him a chair to sit... but he wud not give up on his nautanki.. for only I knew that he had nothing but half a can of pepsi.. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. but I still played along his drama.. he took him to his room.. and reaching there he turned his speakers to the max volume and listed all the rock songs he possibly had.. and acted to fell asleep.. but wudn't let us lower the volume.. and his roomie Ojas cudn't dare to turn the speakers off... just to prove his nautanki he slept in that deafening sound all through the night <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... <br><br>The worst sufferers were his neighbors viz. sachin and ankush.. for chacha wud list a song in his player and wud continue to play it over and over again for days at a stretch.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>He considers doing a certain task his topmost priority which other forbids him to do <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (yahan kuch kuch mera jaisa hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> let me bask in his glory too <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> )<br><br>Continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I consider myself to be the most 'animated' and the biggest 'nautanki-baaz' .. but I stand no where when it comes to 'Kulbir Saini' aka 'chacha' ... but that's only the start.. for this is going to be 'chacha exposed' big time <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <br><br>At the counseling session in July 05.. when my dad saw the name 'Kulbir Saini.. IIIT-H' .. he drew my attention to it and felt happy for obvious reasons.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>It so happened that me and my dad.... kulbir and his dad were in the same train from Delhi to Hyderabad... but it wasn't till we reached IIIT that we met.. <br>the name 'kulbir' in my native place brings to mind an image of '6 feet tall, solid build, mirror-cracking material' .. but what I saw shaking my hand was only better than a skeleton.. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br>I felt a sudden sense of pity and superiority at the same time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... <br>He had never used a computer before coming to IIIT. But very seldom do we see a 'curiosity' take the shape of an 'obsession' <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> .. for he was going to spend the next 12 months in workspace.. trying out 'God knows what' ... my non-techie knowledge can't do the justice of even mentioning his skill-sets <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br>Even though he was allotted a room in OBH.. he still somehow got involved in many of our outings... <br>But it wasn't until the Diwali night in the 1st year.. that we really got together.. I don't know what exactly happened... everyone else was busy having fun.. after dinner... but Kulbir and I went for a walk.. and kept on walking for a long time.. I poured my heart out to him.. told him about a certain.. gal and so so.. we went to workspace... and then he used all the skills he had acquired by that time.. to help me find out that gal.. for a long time there was an account on orkut.. under the name of 'pankaj saini' with kulbir's photo as display pic <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br>He wasn't the 'chacha' until the end of 2nd year... it was then that he kinda became quite confident of his skills.. and that confidence of him has taken him to the heights where only a few of our colleagues have reached... <br><br>Continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One word which comes to my mind when I think of Chacha is feisty. Animated, intelligent but often weird, Kulbir is a very interesting person with a uniquely brilliant sense of humour. He has a witty remark for every situation, which is often enjoyable, but gets irritating sometimes. He is the kind of a person who will do his thing- get obsessed when he likes it, but will never do it if he doesn't. And that is something very admirable. Everyone knows that hes the king <br>when it comes to technical problems and Linux. Everyone knows that he loves playing around with the network and is probably going to be one brilliant entrepreneur. Actually, we need more guys like him who are ready to do their own thing.<br><br>I'll also remember Kulbir for his old moustache. Like the other Saini, he shaved it off later. This skinny chap also loves hanging out with his friends (especially in the coffee shop) and fooling around. I also fondly recollect all his rendevous with various professors in the classroom. <br><br>I wish him all the success in life.<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Chacha Chowdary from Pran comics<br>Fav memory: Volleyball matches<br>Message for him: Sometimes, you need to be judicious in what you say.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kulbir Saini or "Chacha" has a straight forward nature. He is geek <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> and very passionate about anything he does. From first year when he hardly knew anything about computer , he has grown to system administrator of IIIT <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  A job back then seems completely impossible for him. He used to spend hours in labs trying to learn shell, tricks to get everyone passwd <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, and all sorts of crap <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.Anytime I go to lab he is always there doing something constructive or learning something. I remember We use to finish our mid-sems in 30 mins so that we can play AOE, The feeling AOE that time was incredible <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.In first year we  were not that close. Its the second year when he shifted to cellar we became close.Playing pacman, battlefield etc. during Midsems during mid-sems was unforgettable , we used to form a queue for our chances to play these games on his system <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He has a special taste for listening songs. He not only listens but make everybody in cellar listens to the song <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. He chooses a song and loop that for almost a week or someone(Generally Ankush/Ojas) asks him to stop/change the track .From last few sems the Coffee shop has become one of the hottest destination. Its mainly because of him. At 4 almost everyone on grp gets ping from him asking abt CS and next 1 hr we spend in the CS. I guess you are getting ur cut from CS timely <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. In the recent years I guess he has acting younger , he lost his tau like moustache which he used to have, goes out more often and occasionaly tries different things. When comes to food , a yuktahar fan in IIIT, when we go out , order anything with Paneer and he will be happy. Got special love for MacD and biryanis. The "hacker Mama" you played in first yr was really cool and I think you are more of a nautanki in ur real life as well. While placement was going on you thought us those network concepts several times <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, I still have to get that right before I leave. Thanks for teaching us so calmly and thoroughly.<br><br>continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>	 He  nature is kind of extermist. Once he decide that that I want/love this things, he loved that to core <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He goes mad about the stuff whether it is buying domains( he has almost 10-15 domains now), or his caching business etc.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. If he hates something it is hard for you to agree him to do that stuff. Sometime that is kind of annoying <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, Has *$%$ the sysem attitude but often becomes bhiggi billi when the situation changes or someone retorts <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. It would be really funny to think how her wife will treat her <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.  Comes to movies he can watch all the hindi movies even "Saawan" <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. His comments while watching movie like "Vivaah" make you watch the movie without being bored <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.When come to girls he is liked by girl's mom rather than by girl herself. Not talks about girls often or rather not at all but I guess that's what geeks attitude. Hope you will find a geeky girl in GSOC this year <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>	The time spent with him is fun and hope it could be continued.Hope you decide quickly what you want to do. I know once you decide that there is nothing which can stop you from achieving it <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Wish you all the best for all your future endeavour. I hope someday you will be counted among the most successful entrepreneurs.<br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your witty remarks, help when struck with geeky stuff, Biryani<br>Most Memorable moment : - Golconda trip, Paradise Outing , Movie "Mein, meri patni aur woh" , Sholay in Sh-2 and many others<br>Msg for U: - Decide your priorities and act. Think for long term rather than near future <br>Song for U:-  Sochna hain kya jo hona hain hoga<br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
