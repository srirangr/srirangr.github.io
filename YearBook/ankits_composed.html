<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>All good qualities aside, he is a very sloppy person. It is because of his careless attitude he has been into trouble many a times. He has still not learned a thing and sleeps with his dorm room wide open. He is not too popular with the hostel administration and even the faculty. But many a times he just got the short end of the stick. I still remember that day when Prof. Govindrajulu called you a doper in front of the entire class. He is not a bad student; in fact he is a very good student and has spent many hours in library studying. Now days he is totally devoted to Cognitive sciences and Usability Engineering. <br><br>He is one of the best BCbaaz around. He is the only person with whom I can talk about anything sports, politics and even philosophy. I dread going mess with him because he takes 5 minutes to finish one single chapatti. He loves chicken and has explored almost all the food joints in Hyderabad that serve chicken.  <br><br>He has touched the lives of every person in our batch in one way or another. I truly admire you for your enthusiasm and commitment. You were able to quit smoking while I am still stuck after many unsuccessful attempts. I miss our walks to HCU and would like to do it again in the remaining few days. I am glad I had the opportunity to be in the same batch as you. I cannot even imagine college without you and hope that we will always be friends. Be the same fun loving, jolly person forever. <br><br>21.04.09 <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br><br>Aniket Sharma<br>Aka Tullu aka MastRam aka Sutta<br><br>Tullu is one of the most unique people I have met in my entire life and believe me I am not exaggerating. We share many things in common, right from the letters in our names to many of our interests. Back in first year he was the only guy I knew who smoked. I shared my first sutta in college with him (actually we didn't share it, I borrowed it from him) and also my first beer in college. There are too many memories associated with him to jot down here.  <br><br>One of his nicks 'sutta' given to him by the seniors aptly describes his physical appearance, long and slender. But don't go by his appearance because behind that weak and fragile body of his is a powerhouse of energy. If you don't believe me ask the person who started bleeding in just one single punch. He has channeled his energy into organizing felicity '07 and '08, college magazine, Feathers, and various other cultural activities. He is one of the best long distance runners in IIIT and has run many marathons. He is also a good footballer. It was under his captaincy that Agni house lifted the overall sports shield. <br><br>Any discussion about him is incomplete without mentioning his command over the English and Hindi literature. He writes one of the best blogs. His stories and poems are a joy to read. He is an artist at soul searching for means to express it. He used to play guitar in the first year (he even taught me to play guitar), started blogging in the second year and now is into poetry and photography. He is also an avid reader and you can find his room full of books, right from Archies, P.G. Wodehouse to Harper Lee. Sometimes I feel he is in the wrong field. He could have achieved great heights in literature. <br><br>He is not just a person with good literary sense, he is also an adventurer. He loves trekking and exploring new places. We used to go to HCU late in the night. He is familiar with every nook and corner of the college, even the inaccessible jungles. <br><br>contd.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
