<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Prudhvi, the quinessentially flamboyant </b>'live my life big and _|_ to the world' character. <br><br>I've known him primarily as a sportsperson, when I used to play in my second and third years. And I can vouch that few people come close to him. He and his house were a formidable challenge in the Sports Arena. I've always wondered how a single person can play so many games so well, and with such an amazing learning curve. It speaks volumes not just about the physical abilities, but most primarily about the absolutely quick mind he has inside his head. Whether it be the boosts and smashes in volleyball, as a midfield in football, on the athletic field, Prudhvi playing basketball with a broken finger and kicking ass, Prudhvi learning goalkeeping and becoming the lead goalkeeper of his house... the list is endless.<br><br>As a person, Prudhvi is a complete dude, a guy who would make your day any day. Great sense of humor, and a big heart. I remember my unsportsmanlike behavior with him on the field, and how he handled it. Didn't judge me on that one moment, and that was something very good. Stands up for his friends. I remember him coming to my room when we were deciding on the house captain for our juniors. And the mails on life after the unfortunate thefts. Am not saying that I agreed with the execution of these actions, but the heart behind them was commendable <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br><b>Several moments with him.</b> The spat on the track, he playing bb with broken finger, he giving updates on Students Parliament and in front of faculty on behalf of sports council, he giving the speech on the Sports Day, meeting him sitting on his bike on his a placement morning, asking where he was going, and receiving 'Warangal' for an answer, his humongous Shot Put on the Sports Day... Dude, there are all hues and shades to these memories. I haven't always liked, or admired your <i>actions</i>, but I've always been in awe of you for what you are. <br><br><b>Person you resemble:</b> Yuvraj Singh.<br><b>Message:</b> In Punjab, you've found 'your' kind o</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is intelligent and i always envied it. There were a lot of instances during which he amazed me,<br>I will narrate a few,<br><br>During placements i taught him the so called difficult aspects of Dynamic Programming. I told him how to solve string realated problems. He could grasp all of it in minutes and he solved a new problem asked in the written test too. I must say he is as good as me in Dynamic programming, if not better.<br><br>I'm problem setter in DS course so i used to give questions in exam. Recently i asked him to characterize the class of functions f(n), g(n) , in which neither f(n) is O(g(n)) and g(n) is O(f(n)). After asking this question the answer from him came in a just a  second. And all this happened while we were both bathing in<br>adjacent bathrooms.<br><br>I was always dissatisfied with the grading criteria adopted by professors of IIIT. So while we were eating<br>Biryan in Green Bwarchi i asked him can we come up with a better grading criteria. He said yes and before we completely ate the biryani we came up with a solution based on Information theory.  I proudly say this is research at dinning table. We will soon be writing a  paper on this work.<br><br>There were a numerous other instances when i used to discuss DS placement related problems and he used to answer<br>in a flash. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>During felicity being passive  i was associated with him for most of the time.   I have to say he has done things which are invisible to most of the people. The crowd during the Felicity speaks of his campaining skills. He is also involved in Hospitality looking after rooms etc. People from NITW came in busses for our Felicity'08. I can surely say he has taken the campaining to the next level. He has done a lot of things without saying "I will do this/that". <br><br>He has never ever been to a class on time,but during the CAT preperation,  he used to follow a strict time table/schedule. He used to dine on time, wake up on time, do practice tests. During these i still remember on one of the days, I called him(pulling his leg) for a treat and he bluntly denied saying he has work on a CAT  practice paper. For the last 15  days before CAT exam, we hardly talked for 2-4 hours. I'm really happy that for the commitment levels he has shown. At this point i could see real prudhvi hiding in him for all these years and who is now fully determied, charged up, and working owards achieving his goals.<br><br>This is prudhvi doing things unheard of.<br><br>Cont..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I have always had trouble understanding him like i have always had trouble understanding myself.<br><br><br><br>I saw a little correlation between what he says and what he does. Let me give some examples of what he said, 10 pointer <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ,  100% attendance <img src=Smileys/51.gif />, No more copying in assignments <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , 6-pack <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> , Waking up in the Morning for P.T <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , Gold in athletic events(1500mts) during sports day <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, and No more smoking <img src=Smileys/14.gif />  and so on<br><br>At one point, i lost respect for him and called him a hypocrite. I said "You are neither the best nor You are like the rest."<br><br>He says something and doesn't do it.<br><br>Cont...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> <i> part 2 </i></b><br><br>Ma darling is now a professor in LPU. I asked him one day "Arey mama oka ammayi ki marks takkuva vachyayanta. Marks penchukovataniiki room ki vastundi. Em chestav? (some girl got less marks in your subject and she;s coming to your room. What would you do?)" He immideatley answered "Naughty Punjab mchc(ma college's hot chick)<img src=Smileys/10.gif />" and we were all rofling. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>There are many thing I'm gonna miss about this douchebag. But the most unfrgettable moment with was RJing in 3rd year. He asked me to deliver a few dialogues and I was not able to do them properly. He said "I know you can do it. I believe in you. Just relax. You'll be the best RJ". And guess what, I did it. Whoa! Sharing stage with him is such an easy task. You don;t need to do much. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Thanks for that moral support bro <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. I'm gonna miss all that racha that we did during all the 4 Felicity major nights and Freshers'. Those rides to HiTech city. Buddha Pornima(remember <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). That adventure in HCU and many many more. But most important of all I'm gonna miss you dear. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>One small piece of advice: Everything is important. So are studies. I know you are the kind of a person who can set records in every field ONLY IF YOU WANT TO. But sometimes you have to show interest in other subjects as well at least to get passed. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. So please concentrate on your studeis in future. (if at all you are willing to study more <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>Ah! And the most important thing. I forgot to mention about his secret visits to Warangal. I haven't seen his girl but I can say that she must be a very pretty girl and a very very lucky person to have found a guy like Prudhvi. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i> part 1 </i></b><br><br>Om Sai Ram ...<br><br>This guy is the most energetic guy I've ever seen in my life. One of my best friends in IIIT. HAs the capacity to pull almost anyone's leg. Most importantly I like his instantaneous perfect one-liners for perfect situations. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He was the "Racha coordinator" <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> of Felicity '08 and I'd never forget the racha that we did on the final day. When it comes to Racha I think it would be wrong if I don;t mention about the Bashi Songs. He was the first one to introduce me to the Bashi songs and we even remixed those songs (manam rawk mama .. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> recording eppudu cheddam cheppu.. nenu ready ..sye <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) He's got an awesome stage presence too. I still remember the way you STRIPPED on the stage for freshers <img src=Smileys/51.gif /><br><br>Lets move on to the next point. His <b> language </b>. Mama nee deggara nerchukovataniki chaala undi ra. I've learned a lot of thingd from this guy, especially the slangs. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . It wouldn't be wrrong to call him the "chalti-firti-slang-dictionary-of-iiit" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Always refers to me as darling. (and Byatch for Sharat <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) One good thing I noticed about this guy is that even when he's depressed, he never stops pulling others' leg and entertain people. Sometimes he seems to be very rude but actually he doesn't mean to hurt anyone. Its just his style and that most of us are not acquainted with it.<br><br><b> Sports </b> Man! One helluva sports person. There's no sport this guy can't play. Not a single one! Frankly speaking, in my first year I used to think that he does all show off on the ground. But I was wrong. Later I've come to a realization that I haven't seen a sportsman better than him in the 4 years of my college life. And yeah! Hats off to his sportive spirit. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The speech that he gave on sports meet '07 was one of the awesome-est one. So be it Volleyball, Cricket, Soccer, BB, Rugby, (throwball include cheyyala mama.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) he's game.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I really dont know anything about this guy. But I know one thing, he is the person who comes closest to a Stiffler in IIIT <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Prudhvi mama kummai ! </b></i></ul><br><br>
