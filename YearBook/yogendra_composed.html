<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Prateek is the person who truly understands the meaning of living together as a <b>family</b>. Be it the ECE family or IIIT family. He has done a lot for felicity. Being a part of the small ECE group, I feel and admire the sacrifice you have made for our batch. <br><br>When the placement representative for ECE was to be chosen, none of us(including me) was coming forward. Each one was busy in his own work. Initially Prateek was a bit reluctant, but when he saw the pathetic condition of our group, his sense of family arose and he took the responsibility. Hats off to you man! I can never forget this incident in my life. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>The only guy with whom I talk openly abt crazy issues like stuff,sex etc. And his sense of humor is really great. You never feel bored with him. BC marte hi rah jaoge <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Subroto is always ready to go to Mandar to devour chicken biryani. We both feel very satisfied and contented after eating there. We enjoyed a lot in third year. Subroto's room (NBH-48) was always open for people to come in and have fun, masti .. <b>Bommarillu, Happy Days</b> will always remind me of Subroto. We used to watch these fun filled romantic movies with lot of interest.<br><br>He never disappoints you and is always ready to spend time with friends.<b>Yeh banda kisi ka dil nahi dukhata.</b> But at the same time he never screwed up his studies, he is the second ranker of our batch. He is always confident that he can wade through the troubles and emerge out as a <b>winner</b>.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u> Ninja - my TT guru. </u><br>Pata nahi kitne hi ghante maine ninja ke room par bitaaye. Second year mein roj GHEB se NBH aaya karta tha. nitin ka bahut maal khaya hain. hamesha mana karta hai, par maal to mere pet mein jata hi hai. <br><br><b>Nitin is a selfless person.</b> He never thinks what he will get in return. Nitin's work for Yuktahaar is really commendable. I really doubt that Nitin has ever seriously prepared for examinations as you will always find him busy teaching others. <br><br>ninja bolta hai ki usne stuff dekhna band kar diya hai. But i seriously think the opposite<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I call him Aks bhai.  Cool person. Very brilliant and posseses  exceptional logical skills. The one thing I like very much abt him is that he volunteers  every time for arranging parties like getting cakes, drinks etc. Aur party ka hisab bhi yahi dekhte hain.<img src=Smileys/1.gif />  </b></i></ul><br><br>
