<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Both of us used to sit beside each other in the class, we were both in the same house, we were in the group A1 during the english couse, we wrote a number of exams with you sitting infont of me...

We have had great time during our stay in NBH. We used to study together for exams, go for outings, do a lot of BC, and even went out to a pub one. (<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> no girls wid us)<br><br>We were a great set of friends during 1st year and the set called  trailblazers.

<b>For <a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I saw a big change in his attitude after he came out of CVIT. He persued his interests across various dimensions ( blogging, research area, enterpreneural aspects and so on)... <br><br>This is one example of a guy doing what his heart says. I really love they way you are proceeding forward. GG raa...<br><br>Hope to see you as Dr. Gopal Koduri ....all the best raa maamaa <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;<br>mamaa.. i hardly had any interaction with him for the last two years.... Looking forward to a greater interaction in the coming days.. Stay in touch raaa.... <br><br>From what i could see, he is a very hard working guy, with very good analytic skills, can give good  speeches too(Remember we were both in A1)..<br><br>I get a feeling that you are yet to  reach your full potential in IIIT. To put it in other words, you are yet to perfom to the fullest of your skills.  I sincerly hope you will persue your dreams and be the best at what you are doing. <br><br>Pardon me, if i'm totally wrong. <br><br>All the best raa <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>samrat.. when i first looked at him i thought he very studious, who is always studying.. but later i came to realise that he is otherwise.. <br><br><br>I had troubled him a lot during the day of Agricultural MBA exam. The day before the xam, I took his bike and did some damage to it and he has to go to exam center early in the morning. I wonder how he could still spare with me as if nothing has happened. Hats off raa mamaaa <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Gives his 100% while playing cricket.. i can recall the way he dived and caught during one of the matches...

<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Thanx a lot for the testimonial and suggestions. I will surely take note of them. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Himank, during first year he used to code so fast and i always wanted to be like him. He used to solve all the assignment problems on the first day itself. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>During our stay in NBH we became good friends and used to do a lot of BC in NBH-47. At that time being a non-hindi speaker i couldn't make sense of most of the slangs used by them. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>After that in 4th semester somehow i wanted to something big and thought of text-to-image conversion system system. Out interests matched and finally we took it as honors project in which we ended up doing notihng. Both of us had to go Sangal and say that "We haven't done anything". <br>He even posted a blog entry on that . I was very fortunate to have him as my partner. Even though he knew that we are aiming at an unsolvable problem, he still bear with me during this process for more than 6 months. Thanks for all that. <br><br>He has very good analytic skills which i could see during the project. He used to point the crucial aspects missing in the project. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br><br>All the best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Hope we will be friends forever.<br><br>Abhilash I<br><br><br>Blog Entry: http://lifeizlikethat.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/help-i-need-somebody-to-help/<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>A very dedicated cricketer.. I have seen him skipping breakfast, lunches for the sole purpose of playing well during the match... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>He gives his 100% while playing volleball too. we played for the batch and being in the same house we played for house too. We won silver and i have to say without him it wouldn't have been possible to get that medal. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. I still remember the way he took the lead when i was tensed and the safe-play strategy that we adopted successfully to win the matches.  <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>I will always remember your work during Felicty'08. <br><br>I'm sure you will complete the thesis by 2010.

<b>For <a href=charan.html>Charan Thota</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I can recollect him teaching maths during 1st year  exams, dancing during Freshers, working his arse off during Felicity, giving his 100% during placements preperation, now working for samvedana.<br><br>Above all, he is humane with a warm smile welcoming all. <br><br>All the best for ur future raa <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>

He has time for everyting, frieds, studies, jogging, games, ... a true managerial skill <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He is very clear about his arguements/priorities, puts it very precisely and to the point. I saw this while we were discussing about the future career options and in a also during the project discussions and presentations. <br><br>He is one of a kind, who successfully completed a project under Rohit Gupta. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>I must say though he could never bat or bowl he used to come for play during summer mornings. <br>His presence was itself a big booster for the match <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. mamaa ni fielding ippatiki gurthundii .... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>mama.. keep jogging/swimiing reeiii <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> super handsome lokkoccchestondii roiii <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best.. and hope to see you doing MBA in ISB, if not Wharton, Harvard... <br><br>Abhilash I.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is intelligent and i always envied it. There were a lot of instances during which he amazed me,<br>I will narrate a few,<br><br>During placements i taught him the so called difficult aspects of Dynamic Programming. I told him how to solve string realated problems. He could grasp all of it in minutes and he solved a new problem asked in the written test too. I must say he is as good as me in Dynamic programming, if not better.<br><br>I'm problem setter in DS course so i used to give questions in exam. Recently i asked him to characterize the class of functions f(n), g(n) , in which neither f(n) is O(g(n)) and g(n) is O(f(n)). After asking this question the answer from him came in a just a  second. And all this happened while we were both bathing in<br>adjacent bathrooms.<br><br>I was always dissatisfied with the grading criteria adopted by professors of IIIT. So while we were eating<br>Biryan in Green Bwarchi i asked him can we come up with a better grading criteria. He said yes and before we completely ate the biryani we came up with a solution based on Information theory.  I proudly say this is research at dinning table. We will soon be writing a  paper on this work.<br><br>There were a numerous other instances when i used to discuss DS placement related problems and he used to answer<br>in a flash. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br>During felicity being passive  i was associated with him for most of the time.   I have to say he has done things which are invisible to most of the people. The crowd during the Felicity speaks of his campaining skills. He is also involved in Hospitality looking after rooms etc. People from NITW came in busses for our Felicity'08. I can surely say he has taken the campaining to the next level. He has done a lot of things without saying "I will do this/that". <br><br>He has never ever been to a class on time,but during the CAT preperation,  he used to follow a strict time table/schedule. He used to dine on time, wake up on time, do practice tests. During these i still remember on one of the days, I called him(pulling his leg) for a treat and he bluntly denied saying he has work on a CAT  practice paper. For the last 15  days before CAT exam, we hardly talked for 2-4 hours. I'm really happy that for the commitment levels he has shown. At this point i could see real prudhvi hiding in him for all these years and who is now fully determied, charged up, and working owards achieving his goals.<br><br>This is prudhvi doing things unheard of.<br><br>Cont..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I have always had trouble understanding him like i have always had trouble understanding myself.<br><br><br><br>I saw a little correlation between what he says and what he does. Let me give some examples of what he said, 10 pointer <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ,  100% attendance <img src=Smileys/51.gif />, No more copying in assignments <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , 6-pack <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> , Waking up in the Morning for P.T <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , Gold in athletic events(1500mts) during sports day <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, and No more smoking <img src=Smileys/14.gif />  and so on<br><br>At one point, i lost respect for him and called him a hypocrite. I said "You are neither the best nor You are like the rest."<br><br>He says something and doesn't do it.<br><br>Cont...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Firstly, i have to thank him for various things.<br><br>Thanks for taking me to places near and far when i need to get away. <br><br>Thanks for reminding of my achievements when i felt inadequate. <br><br>Thanks for encouraging/supporting my ideas when i didn't have enough courage(confidence) to go and implement them. <br><br>Thanks for helping me in planning my work, setting priorities, taking important decesions and working through the parts that i didn't want to do. <br><br>Thanks for teaching me the most important lesson of "Socializing" . Thanks for sharing your experiences/insights in this process. <br><br>Thanks for reminding me of the values when it was most needed. (Generally, in a state of frustration(no inspiration)  i(youth) forget the basics, the values)<br><br>And Thanks a lot for bearing with me. <br><br>I can only say, a part of my work will always be yours.<br><br>Cont...</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=kabeer.html>Kabeer Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Let me take this opportunity to write about our dear football player kabeer. <br><br>We have been playing football for the past 4 years and have been representing same teams. We played for the house AAkash, for the batch ug2k5, for the college team. I have to say he is the best striker IIIT has ever seen. I can safely say he is the highest goal scorer in the history of IIIT. I still remember the goal he scores in last minute against JNTU in ICHTALON-08. And then he converted the final penalty to win the game. We also won MUFFKAMJA tourney this year, he scored the fantastic goals of the tourney. He deserves to be the player of the tourney. <br><br>During the match, he says in his typical style "Your ball, Your ball, You got it". Though these words look so simple, they drive away the pressure during the match and also fill in lift the spirit of team <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is a good athlete too. His favourite is 200mts. He is the gold winner in that. We missed you in the  sports day'08. <br><br>He is always cheeful, enthusiastic, highly encouraging the team player. I remember the days when he used to knock the doors of AAKASH house team player rooms to get them for the matches. Hats off man, you are a true sports man.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>All the best for your future and keep in touch. Hope the future kids will be wearing red (having white sleeves) t-shirts with Kabeer written on the back. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It came to me as a surprise to see the testimonial from you. Many thanx for that. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Given the little amount of interaction between us(There were barely 5 conversations and in each one not more than 2 sentences from me), it's going to be really tough to write a testimonial for Prashasti. <br><br>At one point of time ( during sports day) i didn't know that Prashanth was her very good friend <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Someone told me a (unparliamentary) rumour regarding her 100 mts run and finally i eared it over to pk. And pk, chand started bulling her. She came and said "Abhilash, that was really rude". This was the most embarassing moment i have ever faced, I regret that i have passed it on and once again aplogies for that. <br><br>She has accomplishments across various sphere are unheard of. She is the First woman house captain, fastest woman of IIIT-H, 9 pointer, Teaching assistant for 4 semesters, 2 time sports woman of IIIT-H, IIIT throwball team player, torch bearer during the Sports day(a rare privilige). <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>She plays good volleyball too. Hope you will continue it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I felt you are always cautious, doing the right things. I have a strong conviction that Prashasti is going to be a trend-setter. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future. <br><br>Abhilash I.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

He is rare combination of being both disciplined and dedicated. A combination you will find in a very few people.  <br><br>He is really helpful. Many a times when we needed to understand the subject we used to go to Rajesh and he would clarify it. He is always enthusiastic be it studying software engineering, teaching <b>software engineering</b>, dancing, and whatever he does. <br><br><br>I get a feeling that he is "A perfectionist always trying to strive for perfection in everything he does ". <br><br>Quote for you: "This is the very perfection of a man, to find out his own imperfections."<br><br>I wish you will complete your thesis asap. Hope we will have great times ahead <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> all the best </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>It is the first IPL organized ever in IIIT-H.  Kranthi was one of the eight captians partipating in auctions. In the auction he bought a set of players which formed  the so called underdog team. Everyone expected it to lose. <br>But this team worked wonders and almost all the records(highest total, highest strike rate, highest run chase, longest six, maximum number of sixes in innings, so on ) in IPL are in the name of this team players. <br><br>Now i say i'm proud to be part of this team, named <b>The Fantastics</b>. Our captain Kranthi, has a unique style of persuading his team members. When someone is not doing well, normally we say "Don't do that, don't bowl like that, don't bat like that etc". But kranthi instead guides him by saying what to do, "Which areas to bowl, which shots to select". I have found this very encouraging and also in lifting the team spirits. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He is also a true sportsman and very frank and modest too. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>I had worked with him on cricket ontology project. Let me share some of the experiences.  When we do not know something our ego restricts us in saying the same. He instead tries to learn it with utmost dedication and without ever complaining. Another aspect i found in him, when he sits on the project, nothing is going to stop him till he completes it. Ofcourse it takes a bit of time to get the start but after he starts things just happen at unexpected pace...  I have seen this while working with him. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>mamaaa, IPL cricket match lo nannu team opener chesav, will never forget those memories. <br><br>Given the dedication levels have and the efforts you put in projects, i'm sure you will complete M/S in the coming academic year (by 2010). <br><br>Hope we will have great days ahead persuing our dreams <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and all the best. <br><br>Abhilash I.<br><br>IPL stats can be seen here: http://web.iiit.ac.in/~mahaveer/IPL/<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Finally a testimonial for you. He has been a great friend of mine for all these years. How shall i describe him ? He is very helpful, friendly, intelligent, behaves childish at times, has a good sense of humour but struggles to understand telugu. Here is one encounter with him that i will never forget. <br><br>I took his bike and went for a ride. Came back to hostel and i was in a tensed, worried mood searching for the lost bike keys. Finally i told soni that i lost the keys. He replied simply "keys kakapothe bike pootundaa ". I was shocked on hearing his reply. <br><br>There are numerous exams for which we studied together, we also played together Volley ball for batch. I must mention that the efforts you have put during placement preperation are worth commending. I bet you will surely reach your goals if you continue the same efforts. All the best. <br><br>More to come <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>--<br>Abhilash I.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>By default people(boys, girls) like him. When someone comes for help to Siva, he is never going to let them down. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Being a project partner for more than a year let me write a few unique aspects i saw in him. His enthusiasm makes you feel the huge amounts of work look tiny. Fortunate to have him as project partner. It is fun to work with him. In this quest we have discovered certain aspects in Indian Languages(wrote a paper on it too). <br><br>He has a great ability to adapt across various abstractions. For example, he can work with any programming language, can handle any operating system, can configure hardware of across various machines, can work with kernel level codes, can craft complex software-composites, can hack websites, ... Needless to say people call him <b>Linux</b> Reddy. Probably this aspect <i>to adapt across various abstractions </i>distinguishes a computer science professional from other professionals. <br><br>I appreciate his intimacy with professors. In one of our project meetings, he asked professor Sangal, "Can you explain it? You can explain better than me ?". Prof.Sangal had no other option and he had to explain. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Now coming the sports side, he is a good volley-ball player. Hope i will see him playing again daily. <br><br>I have a lot more to say. Will write them again. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future raa <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nvkartheek.html>MNV Kartheek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first project that i did in IIIT is with this guy(under bezawada). That was a good learning experience for various reasons. And we partnered to form a programming team also. We were among the top scorers from IIIT in one of the contests too. <br><br>Over years, he has transformed into a better football player day after day. He played for vayu, and then for the batch and now he is playing for IIIT. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br><br><br>We had long discussions on  topics ranging from research options, iiit-students, iiit-courses, life-at-iiit, research and so on. He has always been striving for perfection (forget the g.p.a thingy for a while). He says things like 'It not the place that creates the people but it the people who create *the place*.' <br><br>I'm looking forward to read the thesis he is going to write. I bet, it will be a worthful read. <br><br>Message for you: Don't bother too much about the little things happening around you. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sharat, there were innumerable things we did together. We are programming team partners, remember the first year days during which you solved numerous geometry problems. We also did some projects together. The music similarity function, the blog similarity function on which  we wrote a paper and also got it accepted. The adventurous 4 meb bike ride that we went for on a mid night. The discussions we had on a wide range of topics (acads, life, girls, etc)..The list goes on and on..I will never forget these.<br><br>I must say, you are an *Imagineer*. You imagine things that if existed would surely make a difference to the way people peceive this world. For example, the msf, what the food, brands etc. Stick to these ideas and you will surely succeed my friend. <br><br>You are a good quizzer, programming contest organizer, problem setter. You also write scintillating magazine articles. A good basketball player too.<br><br>the curse of ECE didn't leave Sharat too. The day you got a 'D' in LA, you wanted to convert to CSE. I remember the phone call from your parents raa. But none of these stopped this guy from imagining. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>I didn't speak about the *choclate* boy. The guy who flatters girls on the fly <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I will not speak much on this. <br><br><br>All the best for your future.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It was really nice reading the testimonial you wrote. Thanks for all the +ve's and -ve's you pointed out. Btw, i was expecting that you will write one. (You wrote my first testimonial in Orkut too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )<br><br>Now, let me take this opportunity to pen down my perceptions. You have always been inspiring me, be it, putting your 100% while playing cricket, giving  a persuasive speech, working with dedication for Felicity, or the hard work you put in preparing for exams.. Hats off to you <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . <br><br>All i can say is this, My fading memory still remembers the speech you gave on 'Mother' in one of the English classes. <br><br>Over years you have built strong friend circle. And the set of friends you have is itself, a  worthful testimony.<br><br>All the best for your future. Hope we will be friends forever. <br><br>--<br>Abhilash I.</b></i></ul><br><br>
