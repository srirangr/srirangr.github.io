<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>So many hindi songs have the word, "Chand". Thinking of our Chand in that context creates such hilarious situations which can't be matched. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Anyways, I've interacted very less with Chand but I remember that day in 1st or 2nd year when Chand came to my room and we did a lot of BC about life in general. He said he had experienced drinking, smoking etc. and has gone through some bad experiences and that these experiences have made him wiser than before. I also remember the night when he, Atul, Daddu (I think), and kapil were in my room doing Graphics assignment, we did a lot of BC at that time as well. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He's quite a supportive and understanding person and always stands for the right. When in club 8 someone troubled some girl/lady, Chand seemed perturbed (although he was drunk he was in his senses!) and said that he felt like bashing up that bastard.<br>He's one of the few guys jiske liye meri respect har bar bas badhti hi rehti hai whenever I meet him, like an ever increasing curve. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for the future dude, I'm sure it'll be better but not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>Chand ..<br><br>He used to sit behind me during the first year. All I knew about him back then was that, he's the <b>Mr. Fresher</b> of our batch. And was one helluva BCbaaz. Back then I was all nerdy, I didn;t like BCing in classes and all. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But tujhe dekh kar bahut kuch seekha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Ok. Coming back to Chand bhai! Chandu bhai is an awesome mimicry actor, an awesome dancer, an awesome speaker, an awesome organizer and most importantly an awesome person. Always calls me "chotu" and looks after me as a chota bhai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>First year me thoda sa mota types tha, but 2nd year me to bhai kya body banayi thi .. OMG!! I remember the skit that these guys (Chand and Samhav) had prepared for 22tango. It was supperb man. Simply supperb. And then your dance on "everybody - BSB" in 1st year. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He does all those repetative steps, but sala body aisi hai ki matlab replay dekhne me bhi maza aa jayega <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Fir batch trip me humne milke jo hungama kiya tha. Subhaan-allah!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Saare cult activites me part leta hai. Aur bahut acha perform karta bhi hai. Bande me bahut hi zabardast talent hai. Woh hai paiting/drawing ka. OMG!! Isne to matlab logon ki pics haathon se bana dii. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. 3rd year ka DumbC me jo tune acting kee thi na .. bhai <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>He's a big foodie. Eats like a dinasour. Chicken to bhai iska fav hai. Baat khane ki aa hi gayi hai to bata dun, almost daily ghar jaata hai but khane ke liye kuch nahi laata <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>"Hey Chand!" <br>"Hey Deeps, kya kar rahi hai?"<br><br>--<br><br>This is the way we have <b> always </b> been greeting each other - from day-1 in -H to even now! We have been in the same class, in the same English group and yes, we never really spoke that much in the initial days, but we always really enjoyed the conversations every time we spoke. I see a lot of change in him, not just in his dressing style or in his physique but most importantly a change in him as a person. The change is definitely for good and guess what, the liking has only increased towards this new avtar of his <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has always been considered as a major head being involved in every major issue related to our batch. Every time I see him now, the only thing we talk about is how to reduce the number of cigs he consumes. <br><br>     Yes, he is a brilliant dancer, yes, he is a brilliant spokesperson and yes, he is just amazing when it comes to organizing events <img src=Smileys/41.gif />  - something which I am sure everybody must of written about Chand. Here is something which I think I know about you: <br><br>+  He is the <b>the macho</b> of our batch - is the first impression. Hardly do people know that behind this sturdy body, there exists an exceedingly sensitive, lovable and caring heart.<br><br>+ He is the person whose contact base touches each and every batch of IIIT. He is the most favorite senior of many many juniors and also favorite junior of many seniors <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> - is what everybody knows about him. Very few know how he sometimes prefers being Chand, just Chand like just another guy and not like Chand sir.<br><br>	We have had our share of low times in our friendship and I am only very glad that we have handled it so amazingly well and are such good friends that we are right now and I sincerely wish we continue to be the same in the coming years. Loads of love and best wishes <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>chand bhai aka chand uncle<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>The word "UG2K5" is incomplete and meaningless without this guy. He is the backbone of our batch. There is a saying "God is everywhere", I would like to say it differently "Chand is everywhere in IIIT"<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He gave a lot to IIIT like organized almost all functions, worked more than CR can do for our batch, throw a many dance performances and acts, won the title of "Mr. Fresher", secured a good rank in SPOJ, played a vital role in Felicity 08 & 09 & many more.. this list is endless<img src=Smileys/13.gif />.<br><br>I was really amazed to see his snaps, when he was in 1st year, he was fat<img src=Smileys/24.gif />, had worst dressing sense and wore thick glasses. But now he became one of the most good looking guy of our batch aur ultimate dolle shole bana liye hai<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. I remember the recent incident happened in Club8, where after getting drunk he self-praised and said "yaar bhagvaan ne bahut takat di hai raman tu jahan kahega jise kahega vaha use marne ke liye pahuch jaunga tu bas 1 call kar dena", this shows how much he loves us and treats us like his little brothers... that is why I really respect him alot<img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>A friend in need, he never said NO to anyone and always ready to help us, aur emotion to thus thus ke bhare hue hai isme, jab bhi daru peeta hai bahut rota bhi hai aur fir kisi naa kisi ke pass beith kar apni cheeje sort out karta hai. <br><br>I misunderstood him till 3rd year and never wanted to talk to him because I used to think that he don't accept me as one of the TBian but later I realized that I was totaly wrong. I really do care for him and I believe that he cares for me as well<img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Now only countable days are left, I wish I could go to past and share alot more with him, which I was unable to do. Seriously chand I want to tell you that I really feel sorry for all I did wrong to you, bachcha samaj ke maaf kar dena<img src=Smileys/5.gif />. I will remember you as one of my closest friend in IIIT and will definitely visit at you place freaquently.<br><br> <br>Keep treating me as your younger brother !!<br>May you acheive higher in your future life !!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 4</b><br>Lots of memories to associate with him in these four years that I will cherish throughout my life like - leofying him during late night BC sessions in NBH-47 in 1st sem <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, TB creation in your room, sleeping during GDs listening to Mitra ki bakwaas, teasing him for 4 countinous hours in summer'07 <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, helmet incident <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, Goa trip in Dec'07, booze party on 3rd night of Felicity'08, BTP mein kaatna <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, last diwali at your house, club8 outing in March'08 when I said something I shouldn't have, all the booze sessions and a lot more.<br>Thanx a lot Chandu for being such a wonderful friend. Socha tha B'lore mein saath machaenge lekin koi na, milte rahenge. <br>Bhai ko kabhi bhoolna mat <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your future bro. God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Most memorable moment</b> - Definitely the helmet incident in summer'07 <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 3</b><br>Quite good at acads as well, really hard working and CG conscious. One must see him studying a night before exams. He is so much involved that he won't even look at you when you enter his room. Bahut serious ho jaata hai exam time. Midsems mein marwaega lekin end sem phod ke aaega <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Rota bhi bahut hai saala <img src=Smileys/20.gif />, especially when it comes to acads. Banda exam ke pehle roega, exam ke baad roega, grade aane par roega. Kaatne mein bhi expert hai saala <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Have given a lot of BTP vivas and presentations with him and the ease with which he handles situation, bhai manna padega. Always uses the phrase 'means...samajh raha hai na' <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> after every other word while answering some query and the person who asks him anything gets totally confused after hearing his explanation and simply nods making him belive isne phod diya <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>One of the biggest bewda and suttebaaz of our batch. Master of bottoms up, bhai daroo to pani se tez peeta hai lekin saale ko kabhi chadti nahi. Always ready to give his expert fundes about life after getting drunk, mann to karta hai botal maro <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Extremely good at leofying people <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and comes up with really wacky imaginations about them. But when it comes to leofying him banda bahut jaldi irritate ho jaata hai, though somehow manages to hide that behind his stupid fake laughter <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Aur bhai apne saath to kuch alag hi rehta hai, whenever I try  to leofy him he tries to supress me with the show of his muscle strength, isliye aajkal iski lene mein sabse jyada phatti hai, pata nahi kab muh tod de <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Goes really blank at times (Raman types) which is fun to watch <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br>Anger is something which you would not associate Chand with <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. It is a very rare sight to see him angry but when he does...bhagwan bachaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Thankfully I have never been on the receiving end and hope never to be.  <br>Always ready to help his friends in any situation. Whenever you are in need you can always count on him. Gave me a lot of encouraging speeches before CAT and placements which really gave my confidence a boost<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>One unique thing about him is that he is supremely confident in even the worst of situation. Even optimism will be a very small word when we talk of his level of confidence. Seeing his confidence in really tough times, even makes people around him start feeling the same. But one thing that I would like to advice you is that confidence is good only upto a limit but when in turns into over-confidence and then when you lose it hurts even more. So beware of that.<br><br>The Neta of our batch or I would say our college.  Right from security guards to students to faculties, har kisi ke saath unlimited BC kar sakta hai and everyone is open to discuss their problems with him which he handles easily. Can be <br>diplomatic a lot of times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and ultimately sabko khush rakh leta hai. One will never find him in his room except for his sleeping hours. Always involved in some or the the other issues be it related to friends, bachmates, juniors or college. The amount of selfless work that he has done for this college is really commendable, be it as a house captain, parliament speaker or pseudo Felicity coordinator <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>BCbaaz to shuru se hi hai. How can I forget those days of first year when he used to come to NBH-47 for the late night BC sessions. Me and Pappu used to leofy him a lot  <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> everytime hoping he won't come the next day lekin saala roz marwane aa jaata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. BCing with him that time was just like listening all about Chand. He never got tired boasting about himself and was  irritating a lot of times. But since then he has changed a lot.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Chand. Writing a testimonial for this guy is definitely one of the most difficult task for me mainly because there is so much to write about him and already so much has been written about him that I have no idea from where I should begin. <br>Hmmm .... the story of our friendship goes back to the initial days of ragging period. I entered a room filled with seniors and him. Back then he was a typical bengali bhondu <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> who was fat, had worst dressing sense and wore thick glasses.  We were asked to abuse each other. I went on and on and this guy was totally numb, had nothing to say whatsoever. But then he suddenly asked me to stop and uttered those three magic words - WTF <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> for the seniors and went out in rage <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.I was really <br>amazed to see the audacity of this guy <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. At that time I thought I hurt him and wanted to apologize but din't get a chance. The very next day he came to my room and started talking to me in a very friendly manner as if nothing happened the previous day and hence we became friends. And his becoming Mr.Fresher after that incident was really commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>Ab banda Mr.Fresher bana tha to talented to hoga hi. Is really good at dancing(Ari-Ari), acting (mimicry mein to bond hai ), sketching and a lot of other things which people have mentioned before and so I won't elaborate. Also a dedicated body builder who loves showing his muscles whenever he gets a chance <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is not a regular gym goer but when he does go, it is more like a ramp walk for him showcasing his muscles in front of every mirror, receiving compliments from people around and laughing in his own silly way <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.  Really good at managing things and relations around him, be it family, friends, acads, extra-curricular and or anything else. Matlab banda sab kuch karta hai aur bahut prem se karta hai which is really awesome <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Chand bhai ... again one my of closest buddies in college ... Smart, talented, creative blah blah blah ... jo bhi likho sab kam hi hai ... bande ko politic mein hona chahiye tha ... pata nahin yahan kyun mara raha hai ... I am sure he would do something gr8 there... Maturity personified ...

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Chand, the leader of the batch. I think he is the base behind our batch stand united, unique . Bow to you, friend, for every decisions you took for us <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Right from first year,I used to think of him as this friendly giant <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Kabhie-2 darr lagta hain ki maar dega but again lagta hain ki koi marne aayega toh uski maar lega, he is aggressive, I remember in 2nd year he came to me and said "yaar mere bhai, papa kisi ko bhi lapet lete hain , mujhe bhi kisiko maarna hain, tujhe kisi ko maarna hain toh bol, saath jaake maarenge" I was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> kya ho gya bhai ,sab normal hai. He can be always found with variety of ppl, mixes with them pretty good,right from 1st to 4th year, aisa lagta hain sab fan hain iske <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, and he also take cares of everyone. Anyway this placement season brought us more close. He always used to come to my wing and cry for placements <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ki kaise sab log written nikal rhe hain , Actually he was one of the main reason why I became so cool that time, Isko shaanth krane ke chakkar mein I realized this is not the end of life and zyada kuch fraq nahin padta, anyhow one day I heard he was selected, I was among the gang who gave him bumps he will always remember, cherry on the top was the fact that he will be in Bangalore <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Bhai, party every weekend for sure. Baki I know tu hain toh I don't have to worry a lot. Room mein kabhi toh rehta nahin hain aur mujhe bolta hain ki aata nahin <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> faltoo mein gussa ho jaata hain but still jab bhi milte hain always have a good time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Cheers dude ,for your attitude, friendly and caring nature <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Be the same, you are really gem of people <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Baki Masti to B'lore mein continue rahegi <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Caring attitude, Leadership qualities, Daroo Party<br>Most Memorable moments : - Placement Season<br>Msg for U: - Quit Smoking <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

But that will not affect us at all. Infact zindagi ka safar to abhi shuru hua hai dost, sath mein tay karna hai, ab tu Bangalore mein ho aur main Pune mein hun usse fark nahi padhta.

<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The things which he can draw with a pencil are really amazing. I hope he becomes a renound cartoonist some day. Actually dude you can take Bal Thakre's path - pehle cartoonist, fir neta <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He has passion for movies and obsession with SRK to a great great extent. Infact I once told him that dude you are one arse of SRK, the other being Khatri <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I really respect him for how he has managed to do what he wanted to in these four years. He has good analytical skills and he put them to a good use during this time. His school days had some glitches and he was determined to overcome them in college life, which he did to perfection. I hope you understand what I am talking. A brave effort brother - kudos. The sweetest felling is to conquer your bad-self. As an individual he has matured a lot and made a strong statement to the public by his deeds. But there is always a room for improvement as learning and evolving is a gradual process in life.<br><br>Ab main apun dono ki chemistry ki baat karun to kuch khaas hi rahi hai ye in chaar salon mein. Dhaasu shuruaat hui thi first year mein jab dono batch ke stud the, fir first year ke hloidays mein roz ki online chatting iski, meri, adi aur maroo kee. naa jaane kya kya discuss karte the <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  Come third sem, ye thoda college activities mein zyada busy ho gaya aur mujhe thodi ill-feeling aayi . But vo 3-4 din hi rahi aur fir evaporate ho gayi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Fir sala chalu hua pappu ka <br>silsila. ise main baccha laga aur isne mujhe pappu bana diya. aadha college ab mujhe pappu bulata hai. We are like saif n akshay in main khiladi tu anaadi, the only difference is kabhi ye khiladi hota hai yaa main. Most of the times main. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> From the pappu-times he has given me lots of care, love and support which is very very dear to me mann. Thanks for everything. I do not express myself very often because I take you for granted, aur aage bhi aisa hi rahega, toh <br>bura manne ki to sochna hi mat. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>A rare guy who knows most of the people by their names in the college. Whats more he has a good rapport with the security guards as well and adresses them by their names which is as humble as one can get. Kudos to you for that brother !!! And he enjoys immense faith of the faculty as well. They literally call him to their offices and talk about various things. No wonder he has a better understanding of things than me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Chand bhai is an extremely helpful person, kisi <br>ko koi bhi dikkat hoti hai and I mean any one from across the batches, they seek Chand's help or advice. sala har jagah pahunch jata hai, ekdum tatparr rehta hai madad karne le liye. par mauke ka fayda uthate hue netagiri bhi jhaad aata hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Almost sab jaante hain ise college aur college kaa samruddh karne ke liye isne kaafi kaam kiye hain.<br><br>He had a tough time during the placements, specially because he had high expectations from himself. But alls well that ends well.But I do hope he learnt from the whole experience and got to know himself much better beacuse I feel there were a few things from which he used to ran away from himself and there he was facing them face-to-face during the placements. On this listening part, I'd like to differ from others. He has become a poor listener these days and goes <br>sardonic at times which is irritating. Sala ciggi bohot marne laga hai aajkal, baingan mein mili hui hai filhaaal iski will power, but I am sure jab WO bolegi use ditch karne ko ciggi ko, tab pakke se kar dega <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  Aur iska har cheez ke baare mein opinion hota hi hai, bhale hi wo cricket ho yaa fir train reservation. Aur har jagah body dikhane pahunch jaata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> His general intro is - "Hi I am Subhashis Chand, my dad is in army, look at my muscles" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> At times, ekdum blank rehta hai, pata nahi kahan rehta hai dimaag. Aur Maths kaa naam sunte hi bichare kee fat leti hai. But he is a gem when it comes to creativity and artistic traits. bohot hi zyada umda sketching karta hai aur poster designing mein bhi maahir hai. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In the end we used to force him out of our room. One night I made a point to torture him and <br>stayed in his room till 4, Manish - the poor sufferer <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>He is extremely competitve, most of the times in the positve sense but at times it takes the better of him. And I would hold this quality of his responsible for the formation of TB. Just because some random guy in the batch claimed that his is a very strong circle of friendship, he became jealous and wooed us all to make an official group and call it something <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And TB was born which I think is the best thing that has happened to us in the college and all will <br>remember it throughout our lives. Thanks for that bhai. I guess dance, being our common talent takes a lot of credit of bringing us close. A night was given to us to prepare a dance sequence for an occasion, and what we came up with was something spectacular and has gone in the history books of IIIT-H. Who can forget Ari-Ari <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Talking of dance, we have had some tremendously energetic and funddo moments while preparing dance sequences - be it cult night, youthopia <br>or what not. I have had taken so much of pain to thrust him so-so many steps and he would just not do what I want <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Always doing his own thing and chaniging the step according to his convinience and then giving arguments that he is correct <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>He treats me like a 4 year old kid and I have become used to it and truly speaking more often than not I am okay with it(like it infact) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> though others (Himank, Maroo) get irritated very quickly. Of late I have stopped talking about myself to others but even if I do, it has to be Chand. Oflate he has given me pretty good avices  and I respect him for that. Plus his point of view matters a lot to me which I must confess was not the case earlier. He is a total gem when it comes to relationships, always taking the upper hand and giving his all. He is extremely protective.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>"How would I live without this bloke ?" would be one question which even the Gods will find it tough to answer. Subhashis Chand has been like an elder brother to me throughout the college life. He is someone who understands me the most, cares for me the most, likes me the most, irritates me the most, competes with me the most (especially in the gym and in CL <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). And I guess I have reciprocated very nicely as well (my perception <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )  We share a very very special bond and I am absolutely priveleged to be a part of such a friendship of sorts. Friendship is not a self-sufficient word to express our relationship, <br>it is much much more than that, which I am right now finding it difficult to put it in words.<br><br>I noticed him for the very first time in Sanket's room in NBH. A tall fat fellow with one of the worst pair of shirt and pants I had seen in a long time. As I entered the room he was just blabbering away to glory how he was the one who was ragged most by the seniors. I stayed for a while and then left with a pathetic image of Chand in my mind, I felt sorry for him actually. Second time I noticed him, we were on the same side being ragged by 4th years. There we <br>had our very first conversation and who knew that that was the start of something truly special. Then we spent a lot of time together, not because we wanted to, but because we had to during ragging and fresher's preparation. I must confess he never really appealed me with his acting skills untill his act with Shikha in one of the rounds. And as far as his dancing his concerned, I still think he has a long way to go <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Also I take the credit for he becoming Mr. Frsher (do I need to mention the details <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) After that we became good friends. He used to be horribly dressed throughout the first year and I would tell him so daily. He used to come to my room after 12 in the nights after doing 'masti' with his gang (yeah rite <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and pester me and Chika. In return we leofied him like crazy but he used to just smile and smile some more. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>What I think of you?<br><br>I revere you a lot buddy. You mean a lot to me. You have always been my teacher. The credit for my first ever dance performance goes to you. I still remember quite clearly that I could ask you even the dumbest thing without any shame as you knew my level of GK, English and computers. The credit for changing my accent from nOt to nAWt goes to you. You have always been a source of inspiration and confidence to me. "Tu knocks mein to achcha khelta hai, game mein kya ho jata hai", you inspire me with such lines when I actually don't play badminton that well and it does work I have felt. It was you(and Maroo) who gave me confidence to take part in Elocution in first year which fetch me the first position. It's you who increases my confidence and dedication for gymming by saying "You're improving a lot" even if I'm not. It won't be an exaggeration to say that you are the best teacher I have ever met after my parents. You have always stood by me. There are not many people with whom I can share anything but I must say that you are amongst those. You are always there to help me out like an elder brother whenever I get into some trouble. I sometimes imagine what my life would have been in IIIT if you wouldn't have been there for me. I also try to imagine what my life will be when you will be in Bangalore and I'll be in Hyderabad. I have become so much used to you being around to guide me through various things and acting like a protective shell. You are one of the most intelligent, smart, talented people I have known, and your beauty lies in your honesty. One of my all time best friends in the world! Your words and advices really mean something. I can blindly trust you. I know you'll always be there for me. I can always count on you. These 4 years were the most memorable years of my life and you definitely played a very important part in that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 3<br>We shifted to OBH. I got a room on the first floor and he got one on second. Mota was in NBH and he got a room in Chand's wing. I told Chand that I wanted to be in the same wing as him. He suggested me to move to Mota's room and mota could move to mine. I pestered him to talk to mota regarding the same (I didn't talk to him myself). Though mota got angry but still Chand managed to get me that room (thanks a lot buddy). Though he became very much busy with Felicity and Netagiri<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but still we used to have a lot of BC. Then started bakar sessions in OBH wings. We(Chand, Bhalu and me) used to sit outside Maroo's room and do a lot of BC disturbing others. That dumble incident where we were trying to wake Sambhav up from Chand's room was classic. How many people got angry that day! Slapping him and switching off his laptop still continued. I and Vipul made a story as well regarding a messenger thingy. He got angry at Kshitiz once in which my wonderful smile played a very important role <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He got an intern in Gridstone and went to Mumbai for nearly 2-3 months. I missed him a lot then.Then came my PPI about which I wasn't really having much hope but he had full confidence in me. He said that he'll talk to me only after the result came as if he knew what was going to be the outcome but yes, he was right. I think he knows more about me by now than myself. He started boozing more oftenly but never forced me to do that as he completely understands me and my feelings. Then came placement season. His dedication is worth admiring. I was at home and I was literally in tears when I got the news of his placement. How eagerly I was waiting for that news to come. Then we started gymming again and I started competing with him in showing off the muscles (though mine are not even near to him). His going blank thing has already been mentioned by Vipul. This guy leofies others a lot. Mote ki 4 se 5 hone par, bhalu ki tond par jo maari thi, I can never forget that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2b<br>We started listening to rock together and we used to sing "Where did you sleep last night" by Nirvana together at our highest pitch to match the pitch of Curt Cobain (seems quite foolish now, doesn't it? <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). He also sings "Tujhe dekha to ye jana sanam" quite well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. You should listen to him sometime. I still remember how he got senti when I was leaving for my home for 3 months in first summer holidays. I was probably the first guy to witness his anger <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (achcha hai ki iska gussa 5 min hi rehta hai, agar 15-20 min reh jaye, to pata nahi kya ho jaye <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) but I really admire him for his quality of saying sorry (even if it's not his mistake) to ameliorate the situation. He has always treated me like a younger brother and I have treated him like an elder one. Friends generally don't fight with chappals but brothers do and yes, we had a few chappal fights as well in NBH-146 <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I used to switch off his laptop sometimes without any reason and he used to get irritated which I enjoyed a lot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I was quite bad at computers but he and Adi helped me a lot in improving that, teaching me various things from time to time. It was he who installed EA Sports Cricket '07 on my pc (my first ever pc game). I told everyone about Alt-F4 thing as well (poor guy had to bear all that because of me being his roomie <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). I went to gym for a month in summers and he was the guy who used to instill confidence in me from time to time whenever he felt that I needed it. We had a great time in NBH. and yes, it was this asshole only who gave me the name jaat and now many people think that I'm actually a jaat, wtf!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2a<br>I still remember my first day at college when I was looking for a roomie. To my luck, this guy got a room which was locked and had come to warden's office to get it changed. This was when I met him and found out that he too had lived in Hisar(my hometown) a few years back and we became roomies. Seniors used to rag him a lot (he was the guy who said WTF to seniors on the first day of his ragging, so he was their favorite target.). Sometimes they would ask him to bring some new guys for ragging sessions but he never asked me to come as he knew that I didn't like that. We used to do a lot of BC in NBH-146 along with Adi. I still remember that BC in our room when Maroo and Mridul were involved in some discussions (more of a fight) regarding BITS-Pilani. Chand was looking at me and I was looking at him blankly as we both got quite irritated by that meaningless discussion. We have witnessed some such discussions where they would argue over the topics like "on which ball did Sachin hit a six in so and so match which took place nearly 8-9 years ago". We used to revise together in exams time (Remember that C-programming notebook from which we used to read a few important programs (especially that finding subsets of a set) again and again to mug them up so that we won't have to waste our time in exam on thinking those programs). We can't forget those morning time revisions until 5-10 minutes before the start of the exam, going late to classes daily, a habit which was common in both of us, doing extra C assignment together after exams when everyone was enjoying, consoling each other after seeing both of our names in Jawahar sir's list. Shakti can never be forgotten. That night out to find a really small bug in the code, that running to seniors to just create a line using QT, that running to Anurag sir at the last moment when BJ asked us to enable the GUI for n number of nodes.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br>My first testi had to be for him - my best friend, guide, teacher, critic, brother and what not. <br><br>About Chand: <br>	Bhai, tera naam kya hai?<br>		Subhashis Chand<br>	Kya ?.... subha ...s ??<br>		Chand bol le yaar .....<br>					that's how he introduced himself to me, though some people claim that he introduces himself as "Subhashis Chand, son of Major A.K. Chand, look at my muscles" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br>One of the most interesting persons that everyone should meet and it'll be hard to forget this wonderful being! From 48 kg in 10th to 96 kg in drop year and then back to 78 kg in engg with good muscles, this guy's dedication definitely deserves a mention in this space. A software engineer who loves arts and is very good in electronics must have left everyone way behind if he would have preferred ECE over CSE and way way behind if he would have preferred arts over engineering. But that's the way life is and he is doing exceptionally well in computers as well. He is a jack of all trades, mastering all of those at the same time. An amazing all rounder anyone could feel jealous off. He is a great leader (presently holding the highest post in IIIT a student can hold i.e. the speaker of IIIT parliament) with fodu communication skills, awesome sense of humour, amazing dancer and mimic, good TT and badminton player, very gregarious I must say, body builder of course and bla bla bla. Bla Bla Bla because his qualities are innumerable (the best allrounder of all those I have ever seen) which a lot of people are going to belabour about in his testimonials but this is not what I'm writing this testi for. This is going to be about him and me, what I think of him, what does he mean to me and some memorable moments of this amazing journey of 4 years.</b></i></ul><br><br>

We went from being strangers to really good friends to strangers to friends once again <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Nevertheless, I am glad I started talking to him once again because he's one of the most straightforward,fun and friendly guys I have met here. Its no secret that he is very talented,has great social skills and is a friend on whom you call upon at any time. Can get a tad bit too philosophical at times but at the same time is astonishingly pragmatic too.<br>     I always feel safe when I am with him because he can kick anyone's ass( when required <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Has a great physique and can handle situations with lot of maturity. Things I will remember are the ECE project in 1st year, the English classes, the walks during 2nd year and of late our chats. I regret behaving like a total jerk early on with him but am glad all that is in the past now.<br>     Wishing you all the luck for your future and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>      </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 4</b></i><br><br>Chand is one of those guys who wants to be good at whatever he does, and he generally is a very talented person. He is a dedicated body builder with airs of pompousness about him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He is a terrific dancer and one of the pioneers of Aari-aari. And acting.. Wow! He can act out anyone and can imitate wonderfully well! Who can forget his chor-police act with Sambhav. Or his act in Freshers '05. (Needless to mention, he was the Mr.Fresher of our batch). I remember all those nights spent in Saket's room in cellar preparing for the play. I must confess that i was quite envious of Chand back then.<br><br>Being all that he is, Chand has a way with the fairer sex. He loves chatting around with girls, and was actually a bit of an ass in the first year. (You know what I am referring to, dont you <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) Of course, hes changed a lot now. But hes still the butt of a lot of gossip linking him to girls. Again, that comes with his nature and popularity. Heres hoping that you find your dream girl pretty quickly <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>There are so many other memories with Chand. I'll try and jot a few of them down.<br>* Contesting for elections in first year as allies, it was me who used your popularity actually <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>* All the BC and discussions in Adi's room in first year.<br>* Forming Trailblazers, and the pioneering role you played in it.<br>* Leofying you for not taking me home in the first three years. <br>* Diwali 2008 (finally) at your home <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>* Second sem, and the masti we had.<br>* Organising Freshers, carnival and I-day in third sem together.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>Ahh... Coming to that, Chand is never short of an appetite for BC. Its as if bakar is constantly running in his head <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He just cannot stay without talking. Sometimes, I wonder how a person can have the capacity to chatter <i>so much</i>. I mean, I just get bored of BC after a point of time. This chap wants to go on and on and on. But to his credit, it is BC which you enjoy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Having a good sense of humour, he has often been at the receiving end of far too many leofying sessions <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But credit to him that he takes it all in the right spirit. Also, being the BC-baaz that he is- its him whos often the oil in the machine in the group. Part of that also comes from the fact that this chap has absolutely <i>no ego</i> when it comes to friends. I mean, even if he has a fight with someone, he'll take the initiative and immediately sort it out. I've seen very few people with such an attitude. Hats off to him for that. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I'll remember him for sorting out innumerable differences among guys. I also recollect the fight we had in first year, and the one we had recently over me banging your door <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And how you sweetly came up and said sorry both the times, even though it was my fault. <br><br>But talking about dealing with people and relationships, I also have a complaint with Chand. He is often inconsistent with what he says, and that sometimes gets on to you. I think you definitely need to change that part about yourself. The good thing is that he hardly ever gets angry, and when he does- well, then God save the other person! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .I know- having been at the recieving end once!<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>But today, Chand is far from that. Always ready to lend a helping hand, he is a known trouble shooter across all batches. To me, the greatest example for this was provided during Felicity '08. Though officially, he was a design guy, Chand was everywhere. When I needed someone to talk to the website guys, I'd turn to Chand. When I required a balming hand to smoothen ruffled feathers, he was the first person who'd come to my mind. When I needed someone to talk to Dr. Mitra, he was the guy. In fact, when drunk for the first time, I remember crediting him for being one of the coordinators for the fest. He was the one who'd initiated discussions on Felicity '08. He was the one who fought for making sure that I got to be at the helm. That is something which I can never forget. Whenever we ran into design issues, he would sit up the whole night and come up with a design which no one could refuse. He got us some of the best deals with his charm and persistence, including EA mobile. He got about coordinating with the organizers and allocating volunteers. In short, he was brilliant. I still remember how he'd often come down to my room for Felicity-BC. A lot of issues would be solved right then, with some brain storming from our sides. Those were the favourite days of my life in IIIT, and Chand was a major part of it.<br><br>It will not be wrong to say that he is the most important 'neta' in IIIT <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Neta is just a term, but well, once again, hes there everywhere. As a Parliament speaker, hes one guy who thinks a lot about the college. Once again, hes the trouble shooter for various issues, and has been a crucial factor for maintaining positive relations between the faculty and students. Due to this, and the fact that hes the biggest BC-baaz around, you'll hardly ever find him <br>in his room.<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Subhashis Chand. A man of many facets and aspects. Egotistic. Amicable. Able bodied. Leader. Many memories associated with this chap. So much so, that I just don't know where to start.<br><br>The first thing one will notice about this guy is that he is as friendly as one can get. Right from your first meeting to the latest, he remains that way. Be it the guy at the subway counter or his closest buddy- he seems to be equally friendly to everyone. I remember that in first year, he was one of the first guys to come up and talk to me. In fact, thats when people around him start to think that they cannot especially get close to him. Thats how it stayed for a lot of time- with all the friendliness, he is not one who'd readily share with people. Its a bit of an irony that it takes a long time to win his trust or get him to open up completely about himself. Irony, because people readily open their hearts to him, even in the first few meetings. In fact, thats one very <br>interesting trait I've noticed about Chand. His friendly demeanour urges everyone to start sharing with him even though vice-versa is rarely gonna happen (unless he is really drunk <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) <br><br>When I look back now, Chand has definitely changed a lot over the last four years. Personally, as a good friend of his, I have seen him metamorphosize from a guy who did not share to otherwise. Its another irony that he has <i>always</i> been a guy who speaks a lot about himself (but does not share). However much he may refuse to accept this, everyone knows that he is one chap who can go on and on about himself. Even now (though it has reduced). This was one aspect of his which really turned me off in those initial few days. I found him as one self-centered brat.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Chandddd..... hmmm!!!<br>Writing a testi for this guy would be one of the most difficult task I could ever undertake, describing oneself would be the most difficult job in the world, you know yourself too well that it just becomes a mess of things and it becomes more difficult for me when I set about describing this guy. It wouldnt be so difficult for me to start off with a testi for anybody else but I am quite at loss on how to start writing for Chand. Describing him in one word would be the simplest thing, I need to just write "Alter-Ego" and thats it, there can be no definition apt enough to describe him according to me. Chand and me, its like the similarities never seem to end, its like everytime we have some serious discussion we find some new thing which is common. Its as if, somebody is reading my mind aloud, and the similarity goes to an extent that at times we have had not only the same thoughts but have uttered even the same words at times in similar situations.<br><br>Chand and me didnt instantly hit off, infact ours was a late introduction considering the fact that we both are such big BC baazs!! I can still remember the first BC session we had in cellar, in front of the water cooler near the bed which was lying outside. I still cant understand why that incident is etched so nicely in my memory (given the fact that I considered him jus a badbola back then <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I still rmr the time when we had our batch elections in first year, I didnt know this guy personally but it was only because he was the friend of some close friend of mine that I cheered and voted for him. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Well I need not go into the details of him being the neta of the college, everybody from students to faculty to the guards can testify to the fact. Well frankly speaking I feel he must be one of the most influential person amongst all the batches we have seen but blah blah.... who cares!! For me the "neta" chand doesnt bear even an iota of semblance to the guy, and at times I find this chand too irritating when he is in his funde pelofying avtar, thats why I tend to avoid him at such times but the thing is that we roam around and hang out so much that you are bound to have such times <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ! At times like this you (atleast I) can see him pretending, which I dont quite like. Its only when we are in the wing doing BC that he becomes the real chand, the chand who is my friend! <br><br>The alter ego part generally comes when we are alone discussing about any random thing under the sun. The duo of us must be one of the most frequent roamers in campus, right from 1st year when we used to count the number of pairs roaming around in campus, to 4th year when we go out to buy sutts in the day or at the night time to eat sumthing at DLF (coupled ofcourse with sutts <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) to the latest when the two of us were sitting on the roof sharing the suttes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>To think of all those pillion rides I had on his bike and all the fun we had on all those drives, for quite some time his was the only bike in our group (though pappu had brought his activa b4 him) and it was always great fun riding along with him. I still rmr the summer after our 2nd year when he got his bike and all the escapades we had then which would always land up in us being in trouble, his petrol would dry up or the bike wouldn't start and we had to drag the bike <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> It seems that all of this belongs to an era gone by and yet it all seems like only yesterday.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I'll always hav a qualm against Chand. Since time immemorial we had the plan that we will get into the same company and continue with our BC sessions there but this asshole of a guy had to screw up his Ivy Comptech interview and go to Fucking Bangalore! I can still remember the day we had the written test of Infosys and he didnt qualify the written test. I had got placed just the previous day and had gone through my share of interviews by then which were quite unnerving but no interview or test had stricken a fear in my heart as the prospect of facing him that day. I can never put in words the uneasiness which I was feeling at the time. I wished he could have just slept or something, couldnt even think of facing him. Both of us knew that it would be hell for the other person if one of us got placed and the other one didnt. Even our preparation was done together. The thing which was running in my mind was that I betrayed him by getting placed before him, I mean how stupid and idiotic of me to feel this way but somehow at the back of my mind that was the only thing going on. It wasnt the fact that he wasnt placed till then, the only thing was that I had got placed and deserted him. Thankfully he got placed 3 days later putting an end 2 my misery bt those 3 days wer like continuation of the ongoing hell fr me. It wasnt until he got placed that I was relieved and seriously that day, it felt as if I had got a second placement. I wish that we never the times be so hard on us<br><br>Dude u seriously need to get on a job hunt spree once you get to Bangalore, come back to Hyderabad ASAP, it'll be so lonely without u in Hyderabad man. we rock!<br>This testi still feels so incomplete but dont have it in me to write more...

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>For me, writing a testimonial is very difficult because I share a very different sort of bonding with him.  But somehow I started writing it and got this.<br><br>Chand, our beloved Netaji, is a very good orator. He keeps on speaking for hours and you will never get bored in his  company. A very patient listener too, you can share anything with him and he has a solution ready with him for almost  everything. He is my neighbour in OBH and I'm a constant victim of his bullying <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. I leofy him a lot but he  reciprocate the same to me in a better way (these days <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We keep on doing this whole day and I just enjoy every  second spent with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He boasts of possessing one of the best bodies in our college which I think is true upto some  extent <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Friendly to its core, I have never seen someone more friendlily than him. You roam around in the campus with  him and every other minute he greets someone or the other. Everyone knows him in the college, ranging from first years  to MS, PhDs and the faculty and guards and even the supporting staff. <br><br>Contd.....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>1st Year:</b><br>I hardly talked to him in my first year as I stayed in cellar and he was staying on first floor. At that time I thought  of him as a very arrogant sort of a person who just keeps on boasting about himself all the time, talks so loudly and  was quite jealous with all the fame he got in the first year. I don't even remember a 'hi' or a 'hello' shared between  us at that time. I didn't like the way he used to dance, I think the expressions were pathetic and I thought of him as one of  the worst dancers I have seen when it comes to expressions <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Though barring the expressions, his dance style was quite  good. Even before winning the Mr. Fresher title, he became the hero of our batch. He was very famous among the seniors  and us. We first years' had to perform a small programme on 26th January wherein I danced for the first  time in college. During the practise sessions, I realised that he is not that bad as I thought of him. He was very helpful, very  cooperative. He helped me get the things ready, encouraged me a lot. This boosted my morale very much and I owe him my  first performance in IIIT which was great success (I performed the same dance two more time after that and that's all  because he pressurised me very much to do so <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). After I became a part of TB, I started talking to him but even that  was just a smile pass or a 'hello'.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>2nd Year:</b><br>Second year did not bring any major advancement in our friendship except that I started liking his dance because he had  actually worked a lot on his expressions. That 'hello' transformed into little BC sessions we had in his room or  in outings. I used to visit his wing and he just used to beat me. He has a great body and just to show off that, once he just  threw me in his wing from one wall to another. I was one of his favourite victims to try out new techniques of beating  people (this is true even now <img src=Smileys/2.gif />).<br><br><b>3rd Year:</b><br>Then the third year brought about a drastic change in our bonding. We shifted to OBH and I somehow got a room near his  (I don't know how did this happen <img src=Smileys/7.gif />). I didn't actually want to be his neighbour and I realised that it same was with him. This may be because we didn't talk much at that time and so we both wanted someone else to be our neighbours.  But this is exactly opposite now and I feel very lucky because otherwise we would have never become such good friends.  He used to ask me daily for toothpaste, he often woke me up just for toothpaste (even though I keep on refusing to open  the door <img src=Smileys/14.gif />). I kept on shouting on him for that and finally all my shouting got paid off and he started buying his own  toothpaste. Its hard to find him in the wing (as he always has someone or the other to roam around with <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) but when he  does, he keeps on talking and shouting "Maroo" in some peculiar way and just roaming door to door in the wing. He has a  favourite pastime of showing off his body. He daily comes from the gym and asks if there is an increase in the size of  his biceps. You can always find juniors in his room and Chand Baba unhe funde pelte hue. We had some great outing  sessions which I can never forget. He always keeps on pointing out my mistakes and trying to rectify them by teaching  me things. I simply love it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>4th year<br>This year saw a lot of booze outings with him. Whenever I drink too much and loose my control, I just abuse him and go on abusing him till I get exhausted. But for the past some outings, this abusing has transformed into praising <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Earlier I used to tease him with name of some girls until one night when he just got mad and became so angry that literally phat gayi thi meri. That day onwards I never teased him for that, but got some other topics to <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is the  one who is always there to help out people, specially his friends. You can always count on him. He never thinks bad for anyone not even his enemy. When it comes to boozing, he just transforms into a monster or something like that. Master of bottoms up, one cannot even drink water at that speed, at which he drinks beer. Bond at smoking. Actually he taught me how to smoke (though I quit smoking sometime back <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). He has some really wild fantasies <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (I'm goin to be kicked for telling this). He uses my mobile balance more than I and it's a record that whenever I have asked him for his mobile, it did not have balance. I share  some very emotional memories with him (last Club8 outing being the most) which I cannot forget ever. His one more talent was recognized recently of going blank every now and then. Even Dipti mam noticed this in a class. One more thing, he always knows something about everything. He can be considered as a mobile Wikipedia <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Very  good at finishing his assignments and projects and presenting them. Midterms mein lagwaega aur end sem phod ke aa jaaega (that is what he claims <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ).<br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>

He has  been posted in Bangalore and it was quite saddening when I heard this <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But nothing can be done  about that and I wish him all the luck for his new life.<br><br>This asshole never speaks his heart out how hard you try to make him speak. I just want to say never forget me and  please be in touch .. always. <br><br>My <b>most memorable moment</b> with him would be the numerous Club8 outings and among those the most recent one would be the  most memorable.<br><br>I don't know y but I can feel some tears rolling down through my cheek. This may be because of the happiness brought to  me by all the memories I remembered while writing this testimonial or may be because of the grief and fear of departing  from him. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Best of luck. God bless you. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
