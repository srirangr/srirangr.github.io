<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>First of all wish u a very Happy Birthday...may God bless you wid all d happiness<br>and peace.<br><br>Ab testi shuru: I remember d 1st time I entered into Pankaj?s room and dis guy was<br>sitting in a corner of d room, reading a book. <br>Though he was silent, his looks and d marks on his face gave him d typical Bihari<br>look <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> I was afraid of him. But in just a few days time d whole<br> impression was forced to change by his supporting, caring and his kind nature, a<br>perfect gentleman <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He was d only person who was on my side in r BC<br> sessions, just to support me and hold me again d waves <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . This realization came<br>to me later, how stupid I was.<br><br>He is d most co-operative, most patient, most kind and helpful, most selfless, most<br>determined and sincere person of our batch. Very soft spoken, very<br>understanding...bas bhai doston ka dost hai ye banda.<br><br>Everyone who comes to his room feels as if its his own. You feel so comfortable<br>there <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Jab bhi kissi ka time pass na ho raha ho, he would cum to alok?s room <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>And Ganja would never complain, rather always entertain d person <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> pata nahi how<br>does he manage dis. Har time thr is smone in his room doing BC. Phir bhi alok does<br>his work on time...I mean Ganja would never say I?m busy or doing smthing...he?s<br>always available for u 24 X 7...

He was teased a lot abt N in r group which he never used<br>to mind. But thn limits started crossing and all dis was made public. He kept his<br>own in d worst situations. I mean neone else wld hv reacted strongly, but he handled<br>d situation well. He is very mature in handling human relations <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>(contd)</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=kabeer.html>Kabeer Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1:<br><br>I had d fortune to be his roommate in d first year. <br><br>We had contrasting natures and it was a new experience for me. He was an extrovert, loved to play out in evenings, always kept distance from studies, was known for playing tricks wid his lab PC (which he made unbootable <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). He used to spend most of his time in lab until he had a laptop. So I would only get to interact wid him in C-9 during our overnite BC sessions. Once he bought a laptop he would never leave d room <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> and thn I felt i had a room partner.<br><br>He has a very deep sleep. There was an incident when he slept early one day, and locked d room 4m inside. I cam back started 4m knocking gently...thn boldly...thn even more bolder...then gave a dozen calls on his cell which was ringing loudly...i gave up and went to Pankaj's room to sleep. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In d 2nd year he swapped his room wid Dharmeet who was njoying a single room...it smtimes makes me feel i was a bad roomie... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He has a great passion for computer games. It can be demonstrated by an example. I had stayed for a day in Delhi in his house. We had reached there around 10 PM, had our dinner and went to sleep. In d middle of d nite, I could hear some 'Yessss', 'Oooohhh', 'Yaaaaar'. I woke up and gathered some consciousness. Kabeer was thr playing FIFA <img src=Smileys/13.gif />, completely immersed in d game. Such is his obsession for gaming.<br><br>I had a wonderful time when I visited his home. He is very lucky in terms of his family.<br><br>He is a great athlete. He has a very agile body...is extremely quick wid his reflexes.

Sachin and rahul were both shortlisted in both d companies for interviews. I was handling Cap and Adi was looking after Cit people. Sachin was in his 2nd round of interview wid Cit and d Cap people were looking 4 him. I had delayed his interview sending in others in d queue. Worries and thoughts had crept in my mind<img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Sachin finished his 2nd round wid Cit. I smwhat wanted him to get through in Cit and not Cap. I thn called him for his interview with Cap. He came thr...Adi told me Sachin can hv his 3rd round wid Cit. I was in a fix <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> shld I send him thr. Thr was a lil room to make Cap people wait.So Sachin went back to attend his 3rd round at Cit. Now it went a bit far delaying his int. wid Cap. But he was in d middle of his int on d other side. I was feeling guilty <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. By d time Sachin finished his int at Cit, 1st round team for Cap had left. I kept dis secret 4m Sachin. And by God's grace after his 3rd round he was immediately asked for his 4th round wid Cit. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. After his 4th round at Cit, I told him tht he was no longer considered for Cap. But he was cool and happy wid his performance wid Cit. Now, I became even more desperate for his selection at Cit. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>And thr was another thorn in d way. Rahul was in d final rounds of both d companies <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. It seemed he would get an offer from both. Chances were strong tht Cit would give only 1 offer. Results were being discussed by Cit people. Rahul was in his final HR round at Cap. There was an argument b/w me and Adi abt wat course of action to take in d various cases arising of d situation. Finally d news came tht both Rahul and Sachin were offered a job by Cit <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. It was a huge relief for me. I ran down to d room whr Rahul was being interviewed and told d Cp people tht he's no longer available 4 dem. I can't really express my happiness at tht time <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.

He would always be wid u when u need him, watever demanding d situation may b. He would support you in a completey selfless manner. And all that comes so naturally from within him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is very well off in interacting wid people. Bas thoda exagerate karne ki aadat hai ise <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>In d 1st sem, both of us were together sitting in d library and I was noticing him reading books on books <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ...some IAS stuff. I was holding a novel and could hardly read smthing <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He was determined, 'IIT main nahi hua, ab to mehnet karni hai, research karni hai...IAS ki tyari karni hai...koi kasar nahi chhodni'. He used to tell me about his intermediate days.

Finally I am very happy that he is placed in Google, but I regret MS incurred a huge loss by missing on him.<br><br>He is gifted by God for many things and there can't be another Ankush.

<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ankush Kalkote <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> A very simple and light hearted person, always remains happy. Is extremely talented and very much down to earth. A gem of a person <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />(zyada ho gaya lagta hai). <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>It was day one of college when Ankush, Sachin, Kabeer and me met for d 1st time outside BLN's office. Luckily we got rooms together and that too in NBH cellar <img src=Smileys/1.gif />(awesome BC place). I remember him being part of our discussions on ragging stories of our batch. He looked innocent but <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . We all used sit together in Pankaj's room and our BC used to last till late nights. We all together used to go to Akansh sir's room to watch movies. The 1st impression of him not being ordinary guy came to me when he explained to me some concepts of DLD. And I would admit tht his excellence was a driving factor in initial stages of our friendship. I had a repent I couldn't do my ITWS 3 project with him <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but that's now won over by our 2 year long association in all our major graduation projects <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Ab to apni team itni strong hai ki, koi bhi project ho, 2 din mein to hum kar hi denge (ab kaise woh to hmein hi pata hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) But haan shayad logo ko sach nahi pata ki kaam hamesha Ankush ne hi kiya hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> We together have been through many good as well as bad times, but it always relieved me when he said, 'tension mat le yaar' .He has always been very supportive and is my lifeline in wanting times. Please don't change <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>I believe its tough to be my friend as people have to bear with me for many of my strange habbits and he has done that without ever showing it. Hey, I am sorry for not being in the campus for recent times but our friendship still remains d same. aur haan ghar paas mein hi lena.<br><br>He loves Marathi, often hears Marathi music and reads Marathi news and books. Loves his culture, his family.<br><br>I won't b wrong if i rate him as one of d best brains in d country <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. His interview call from IIM Bang was not luck but talent (he prepared as much for it as we do for 8th sems exms). Neways this wasn't a surprise for me. </b></i></ul><br><br>
