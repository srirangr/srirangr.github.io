<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kapil Agrawal, one of the most sophisticated guyz I have met. Bhai 2 saal mera padosi raha lekin pehle ek saal to baat hi nahin hui kabhi bhi. He has this attitude that everyone is a jhandu here and I'm the bond. Whenever he speaks anything it definitely has mote than one meanings and janaab kabhi bhi seedhi baat nahin karte. But inspite of all this, I always enjoyed talking to him and it has been fun all the time in his company.<br><br>Well dressesd and very brand conscious, I have never seen him wearing anything that does not have a big brand tag. He used to keep his room clean and Sambhav was the one who made it untidy all the time.<br><br>He has his priorities set staright in his mind and he has some goals set. This is why he opted out of placements because he wants to do an MBA at any cost. This was a very tough decision I believe, but this shows how focussed he is towards his goals and ambitions. Hats of  to you buddy <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>I pray that you'll get whatever you wished for and will get into IIM-A one day. Best of luck mate. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bhai as we fondly call him.Is very shopisticated and da only person seeing whom I get irritated smtimes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and I think the feeling is mutual <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...light le bhai majaak kar raha hoon <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is a person of his own kind. Speaks less par jab bhi bolta hai to dhamakedaar bolta hai. Loves watching hollywood movies and all those TV serials. Mujhe to naam bhi nahin pata jitne yeh serials dekhta hai. Though we wr in the same wing in cellar but we only came to interact in 4th sem as far as i remember. And once again the reason is same. I dont find myself very comfortable wid new ppl. Waise inka bhi haal kucch kucch waisa hi hai. Is quite confident and focussed. He knows his path and follows it <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Banda placement mein bhi nahin baitha. good <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <br><br>Bhai ke saath as such meri kabhi jyada BC nahin hui. In fact Bhai jyada bolta nahin hai. Mein hi kabhi kabhi taang khinchne ki koshish karta hoon aur bhai bura maan jata hai. Bura na mana kare bhai.. tujhe to pata hai meri majaak karne ki aadat hai. DumbC bahut accha khelta hai. Is a mobile wikipedia of movies and tv serials. Most of the times all of our group studies together but bhai likes to read alone <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. aur jyada kucch likhne ko nahin hai bhai mere paas..so jai ram ji ki.. hamien yaad rakhna.. hope ki aap kisi IIM ya phir bahar se MBA karo. All da best for your future and do stay in touch. You are an unique person of your own kind <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Even if I try my best, I cant be as sophisticated as you are <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Kapil aka Bhai</u><br><br>My fellow cellarite in the first two years, initially I just knew him as the roomie of Sambhav. He was way too silent to be noticed and yet for some unknown reasons, I disliked him a lot over the first year or so. I still don't seem to remember the reason for the hatred I had for him back then <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and now looking back at those times I can do nothing save smile at my stupidity. Later on I came to know him a little bit more (though we never had much interaction, he has always been the silent one) and I lost all my dislike for him, has always been a nice company whatever few times we have been talking.<br><br>Heres wishing you all the best for your future<br><br><b>An advice: Man start speaking up, you are way too silent <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kapil aka Kaps or <b>bada bhai</b> is the most sophisticated banda of our batch. Based on the principle of <i>Simple Living, High Thinking</i>, he is Very Sincere, helping, apt (bahut kam bolta hai, jab bhi bolta hai sab ko chup kar deta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), always up-to-date with current affairs, dedication towards movies and sitcoms <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <b>aalsi</b>, <br><br>Although we were in Kota for three years, in same coaching institue, but we didn't know each other. During our initial interaction, we became good friends. Since then, we are very close to each other. The one thing which I appreciate the most about him, is his clearity in mind. He has so much confidende in him that he didn't even sit in placement <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>All the best dear for your future, and hope u do MBA from some top college.<br><br>Thanks for the delicious food, which u brought on the Nagpur Station. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kapil Agrawal, not know about his existence for first year. Got to know him during Keral trip. At trip we discussed many things and enjoyed a lot, after coming back that it was like we always hang out. Goes for dinner together, sit next to each other in class etc. In one of (boring) algorithms he told me about his future plans, how he want to fly <b>abroad </b>and be in the likes of Jack Welch, Richard Brosnan etc. I owe my second PT credit to him <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Always wakes me for PT, altough we went for equal number of dayz he got more credit than me <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> . He is the only one from batch who got a punishment from IIIT Prof.  <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> My BTP partner whom I worked very hard to write a report <img src=Smileys/24.gif />Banda Sophisticated hain but adjust kar leta hain har types ka environment and recently proved himself master of all the b-graded movies both english and Hindi <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>	Is a big fan of english movies and sitcoms.He has a list of almost 50-60  sitcoms available in dc and out of those he has seen almost 25-30, not only he watched them, he knew every trivia, character name, history etc. of the show. when come to FRIENDS ,I think he knows dialogue of all the 224 episodes <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He must have watched them like 10-15 times.ThankYou for introducing me to F.R.I.E.N.D.S. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />  and most of the sitcoms I watch today. Trigger him with some name or incident of any sitcom and he will on and on about that, telling you about things he noticed (and he notice minute details <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ) and often raises your interest in watching that sitcom. Same is with movies, he always keep watching all those movies in DC which no one even bothered to download <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Our team at Dumb-C , I think is unlucky otherwise with you, me and GKB its hard to loose <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> anyway we won Antakshari'07 <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>	Loves going out. Often pings everyone for trying new restraunts and places. Always chooses off the track places like Indijoe, Little Italy etc. Loves variety and different cuisines when going out. He is very reserved kind of guy, no matter how close you are, I think he hestitate to share things.Altough he is a big Gossip.When you wants to tell something or someone(generally GKB) has an incident to tell , he is the most intersted in the topic. Listens to everybody and makes excellent sarcastic remarks and comments when we target someone.But he holds his friends at very high position. I remember with sincerity and honesty he told me that <b>"Our friends are our real treasure we earn in college" </b>. I was impressed by that honesty and saying that like you mean it thing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Very choosy when comes to shopping, ek jutte ke liye pta nahin kitne logo ko har joote ki dukan le gya tha <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . Many times acts a bit irritating , donno y <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> but us samay ise laat marne ka bahut mann karta hain but overall a nice guy and my FRIEND <br>Wish you all the best for your future. Hope you will be the business tycoon in likes of Jack Welch etc. <br>Keep in touch .<br><br></b><br><br>Will Miss U for :- Witty remarks here and there , Always ready for outing and something new.<br>Most Memorable moment : - Kerala Trip , TOC exam before night , watching the Big lebowski  and many more<br>Msg for U: - Listen to others and Call me if you need CTO/CEO for your company <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Song for U:-   Sabse Bada Rupaiya ( keep dancing on this one <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> )<br><br><b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My interactions with Kapil started in the classroom- thanks to the seating arrangements we had. We also had adjacent PCs in the workspace and I fondly recall those good old days. The good old days of joint classrooms and workspaces, and a lot of social interactions. We (Kapil, Bajaj, Dandu and me) would have a lot of discussions in the classroom about varied stuff. Thats when I realised that Kapil is one chap you want to be careful with- he can pick up on any of your <br>utterings and start leofying you on that. And his style of leofying is unique, he'll give you a wierd look and a change of expressions which makes you think, "Why did I even say that?" Its happened so many times!! In fact, he is a pro at leofying Bajaj <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Kapil is big time into sitcoms and movies, and his knowledge in this domain is impeccable. Hes seen most of the sitcoms on LAN, his biggest competitor is probably Bajaj. He is generally quite chilled out and loves having fun. Also, he has a good female fan following; but I have never seen him interacting with the fairer sex!<br><br>However, there is a lot of clarity in his mind about what he wants to do in the future. It was evident when he opted out of placements. I really that hope he makes it big in business, and does his MBA from a top notch B school. <br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b><br>Character he resembles: Billoo from Pran comics.<br>Fav memory: Conversations in first year.<br>Message for him: You got to be more proactive!<br></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Due to seat numbering policy of IIIT I met Kapil as we had adjacent seats. The first impression I got of him is that of a very complex and sophisticated person but the minute he started speaking I was surprised. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> After a few arguments he convinced me that I am from a very small place near Jaipur <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( I don't remember why we were arguing ). Due to him most of the lectures were less boring, as we both couldn't sleep, so we used to talk all the time in the class. <br>He is also a huge fan of most of the sitcoms and TV serials that I also like so we can talk all day without getting bored. His knowledge in this area is secondary to none <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and I am just not saying this. You can compare whatever he says with a wiki   and that makes it all the more harder to argue with him <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> as he is always right. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>He is the one on whom you can count on whenever you need him. I remember when I was going home and I wanted someone to go and attend one of the lectures of ijcai conference for me (someone who would actually go through the torture of sitting during the complete lecture ), his name was the first one to pop in my head. <br>If you want any advice on something than you can always go to this guy as he will give the correct advice considering all perspectives. <br>I just want to thank you dude for being a good friend all these years and also best of luck for mba exams ahead. </b></i></ul><br><br>
