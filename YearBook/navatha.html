<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Only one word comes to mind when some one takes her name  <br><br>                        <b><u>"VAYU"</u></b> <br><br>We first met during the freshers preparation for vayu house. She used to give lots of feedback and used to suggest alternates to my dance <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> . A bit bossy, yes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But that's just because of her dedication towards vayu house <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I always used to feel guilty for not doing anything for the house. She used to approach me for participation in 1st year, but I guess she understood that I am have joined the 5th house <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .<br><br><br>Hats off to your dedication towards Vayu, enjoy your MS in US <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>Best of luck for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Naatha Tatineni - rather sweetly and shortly called Navs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is the all-rounder gal of our batch. Whatever gains her attention, she starts practicing it, she comes out in flying colors with such an ease - be it sports, games, athletics,  dance, acads, what not for that matter <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> She has quite an inborn talent for everything <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ...including sleeping <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She can sleep and sleep and sleep for hours together <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I spent quite some time in her room and can never forget the way we prepared for WDKM end sem exam - we slept till 8 in the morning <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> (plz don't assume that we were done reading by then) And can you believe it...even then she managed to get an A in that course <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Her dedication and contribution for Vayu house were commendable indeed <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> She, hardly ever, loses her temper with anyone. A fellow FRIENDS-freak <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Ang yeah...she's gonna be a New Yorker. Congratulations on that Navs <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br>    I will, for ever, treasure all the laughs we had. I wish you all the best for all your future ventures. I'll miss you a lot.<br>Love u loads Navs <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Navs<br>Still I remember our first meeting when me and Charan greeted on your birthday in the lab. She is the one most trust worthy person in college. She is one of the best frns in our college. But every one to their surprise and ofcourse me also we never talked to each other for one and half year for no reason. I'll never forget the day when you again talked to me.<br>        <br>           Apart from our relationship, Personally I vote her as a best alrounder in IIIT. She gives her full heart at what ever she does. She and Prashasti tried a lot to convert me from Agni to Vayu as I was discouraged by lack of opportunities. she is very attentive at her looks. Literally I survived from DLD exam only because of her. She has great skills in explaining. I personally give her an advise to do Ph.d and become a professor. not in LPU <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .<br>She does things in extreme levels. telugu lo " athi vrushti anaa vrushti la"<br><br>Ne ways Best of luck for your future. Miss you <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Navatha ... I shall remember this girl as the best female dancer of our batch. Her dedication towards dance is godlike. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>A small piece of information I wanna share with you. I was very very afraid of you. For some reason, and I dunno what, I feel like you'll slap me someday so hard that I'll fall down on the ground and dust will rise(in a bit telugu film style.. dummu levvatam.. a stream of blood coming down from the corner of my lips, broken spects and all. you are getting the picture right? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). But I stopped feeling like that from the second when I came to know that you are scared of watching RAAZ in your own room <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and that you are not that dangerous as I thought about you.<br><br>You are a true Vayuite and your dedication towards house is something really worth appreciating <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Not only in the cultural arena but also you've shown some incredible performances in sports. Her discs throw attempt was better than Chand. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> What an energy!! A big hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to all the effort that you've put to take your house to such great heights.<br><br>The most memorable moment would be sharing stage with you in Felicity '07 and winning the 1st prize. It was truly deserving. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Keep rocking and all the best for your future.<br><br>Best<br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Navatha...first thing that comes to my mind is "Sushu mess "...Always the first one to gather people during mess time...U shud be very patient to take up this job...Well...navs looks very srs..but it is only when u come close to her..u will know abt her cool attitude...Very organized and it is sth I always wanted to be...but couldn't reach ur heights <img src=Smileys/2.gif />."Sleeping beauty" is what her btp partner calls her and trust me...the time u spend in waking up this girl will be many times greater than u spend in studying for ur exams...<img src=Smileys/10.gif />.If I am given a single word to describe her...I would go for "All rounder" for she just tries to give her best shot at everything she does...and most importantly she succeeds most of the times...Hats off to u <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.Congrats on getting into ur dream university..I am happy for u da...Hoping to stay in touch and lets rock in US dear <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Wth loadz of luv "Sushu"</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Navs is a super gal. Very soft-spoken and truly sensitive.

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The only person with whom I came pretty close emotionally . It rains outside and I think - "Navs wouldn't like it.. She would say - but.. my hair <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". I hear rock music being played somewhere and I think - "Navs would have hated this music <img src=Smileys/1.gif />".. I see Jr. NTR's poster and I think "Navs would have liked this one <img src=Smileys/10.gif />"..<br><br>	 We met each other well before we came to -H at some gathering of Sri chaitanya and man.. how much have we changed since then!! Talking about Navs,welll..she is a great dancer, a brilliant orator, superb at acads (ask her the list of universities who so happily accepted her!).. An ideal child - one about whom all our parents keep dreaming day and night. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	We became quite close at the end of our first semester. I still remember the way we buttified EC ke circuits at the last moment, only to screw the exam even badly <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.. The best would be the night out which me, harshi and navs had for Maths-1 where Navs was sleeping all the time and Harshi and I were scolding, kicking her to get up and atleast listen to what we are studying.. Still, she got an A- <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> .. Those nerdy things apart, we had a lot of fun - gossiping, reading novels <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , fighting Chuck bass v/s stupid Dan., fighting that rock songs are the best <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>	I missed her so much during my 3 months stay in Bangalore last year. I cannot imagine how much I would miss her when she will be going away for two loong years in <b>pursuit of masters </b> <br><br>We are so alike when it comes to few things and so totally different when it comes to few others.. Thanks to her, I have changed a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..Everybody says they have had ups and downs in their relationship..Suprising, yet true, we have never ever had any downs.. A fact which amazes everybody, even us.. With passing time we have become only more closer to each other than we were ever before... God bless our friendship and I only wish it becomes (if possible) even better.<br><br>Wishing that every wish of yours comes true <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Love you and will miss you the most <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Here goes my testimonial girly....<br><br>There are days filled with laughter and tears, spent with my dearest buddy. I can write as much as I can but I'll restrict myself. I have no much interaction with her till my 3rd yr. It was then when we both decided to work under Prof. Pudi. Yeah I now remember... in 2-2 we both took "sanskrit" and there started our so called "studying together" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> thingy and in the summer 2007, we stayed here and took seperate projects under Prof. Kamal. Slowly we interacted a little and soon became very gud frends. <br>Starting with our honors project, till today I worked with her(thanks Navs for putting confidence in me to be my project partner.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )on many projects. Starting from 3-1 till 4-2 I remember almost every single moment that we spent together.<br>She is a person who is extremely cool and always bindaas <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> you won't believe there were days when she actually started preparing just one hour before the exam and still stayed so confident and ultimate cool <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> To be frank she helped me a lot to reduce my tension and to be cooler than before <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Thanx Navs...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>And now comes the sleeping marathon. Phew... I don't know how she is going to manage in the future but its a very very tough job to wake her up <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Her constant response to my sincere effort is always, "Lyddu just gimme five minutes. See I've set the alarm also". But it was fun to wake her up <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>In our friendship, I never remember a single incident where actually hurt me except once in 4-2 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>She is very excited about sports and cult events. She doesn't seem to be very dedicated but actually she is!! If she thinks to do anything she actually strives hard to get it. Also she is the most happening girl of our batch and an all-rounder too.<br>Tears are rolling out from my eyes to think about our parting. She is a friend who is always there for you in need. She is the one who understood me very well and with whom I can share anything and everything. She was there with me during my sickness, joy and suffering. I always used to irritate her with all my stupid jokes n activities (thanks Navs for being so patient with me).<br>I'm very very sad to say her gud bye <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> I'LL MISS HER A LOT. Hope wherever we go, we'll be together.<br>Luv u loads sweetheart <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I never had much interaction with this girl but I don't know, when i sat to write a testimonial for her, quite number incidents came to my mind. Some of them which actually touched me were:- <br><br>Hamari shuruwat aise hui.. It was our first month in IIIT and we were coding in workspace, I mean she was coding mai to aise hi, mujhe coding kahan aati hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She asked me some doubt and then I asked her rank and got impressed by it. <br><br>Ek baar, maths ki scripts dikhai jaa rahi thi. I scored least 8/20 and was much depressed but still as a CR i stood up on the stage and kept distributing sheets to others. I wasn't comfortable that night as my performance in examz were not up to the expectations and had of lot pressure on me from all sides whether it is parents or jawahar's scp case or CR work or any other. After the session I went to mess. Some time later at 9 I got a call from someone saying that TAs have called you soon they want you to order all the scripts based on roll numbers else you would be given F. First year tha didn't have much understanding about the grading policy. I left from the middle of the dinner and went to the venue. It was a frustrating job. There I saw navatha moving downstairs. She casually asked me where are you going. I told her about the phone call. This was the time when i needed support but didn't expect help coming from this corner. She said I will help you out and me, navatha and harsha together arranged all the scripts. I know you must have forgotten it by now. But i still feel as if it was last night.<br><br>She is honest, hardworking, trustworthy, friendly, inteligent. I had a myth that a girl cannot be a captain of the house as she has to every time deal with boys and entry to NBH is not possible. But she proved it false. I have seen her dedication for the house. Sitting late hours and preparing students for the contest. This is why in prithvi house i had no objection of shravanti heading cultural.<br><br>Thats all i want to say and yes thanks for all those proxies in music class <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>A true friend, super-committed to her house <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, fab athlete and one of the most responsible girls around. As friends we have had our share of ups and downs but I think that has made our friendship stronger. Will always remember the times when we saw horror films in her room with eyes half covered, planned on studying and ended up gossiping <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , went out on long walks and more recently drives <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All the best for all your future plans <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and tons of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
