<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I didn't have the privilege to meet him till 3rd year when I decided to live in NBH 3rd floor. Initially his constant visits to my room (sometimes every hour!) irritated me, but within a couple of weeks I got used to it and often<br>looked forward to it.<br>This guy... phodu gamer... has awesome gaming skills... great shooter, great strategist... never had an honor of playing alongside him or against him.<br>Persuaded me to come to coffee shop with him so many times...<br>I really like his simple honest manner. Although not a personal experience, I heard from others that in a monetary transaction or case of debt, he remembers how much he owes to others, but doesn't bother or seem to remember how much<br>money others owe him.<br>He's one of a kind, so friendly and full of life.<br>Looking at him walk and laugh makes one feel as if one was looking at a small kid. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He's a "Yes man"! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Lol, I remember whenever Gaurav, he, I and others have gone out to have dinner, he always has a soft drink after dinner, either buys it near the place where we had dinner, or comes back to campus and has soft drink. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kiran Danduprolu, or Dandu, is a hardcore gamer <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He plays lots of games and is still too good at each one of them <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, particularly CS <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I remember all the AOE games we played in first year to the CS games we played in summer 2k7 and afterwards. He's a really cool guy. One bad habit that he has is cracking PJ's. He knows a lot about english movies. He's very energetic and is ready for whatever BC/Gaming you call him for. I've been to many outings with him. He also really likes to eat lots of good food and eats out very often <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He also has good knowledge of lots of technologies. The other thing that I really like about him is that he never gets angry and its usually fun when he is around, except for the PJs <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.  <br><br>Although his GPA may not reflect this. He's really smart and quick problem-solver. He got a very good result in CAT without any preparation <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He doesn't care about grades etc otherwise he would have been one of the toppers of our batch. He's a pretty quick and good programmer as well. <br><br>A small message for you: try to take life more seriously, and I know you will go a long way.<br>Will remember you for: CS, VB</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kiran Danduprolu aka Dandu aka Gargoyle aka Grolag<br><br>Apna dandu bhai ultimate cool banda hai. He is very sharp. I can say this thing for sure because his pc was not very far from mine in workspace. I have seen him doing C-programming. Is bande ka jo dimaag chalta hai, that is simply class. Then I never interacted with him much until now when we started playing CS together. Awesome CS khelta hai yaar ye banda. He is very passionate for CS. Agle din subah Dell ka interview tha aur mahashay raat mein baithe CS khel rahe the. Itna kaha ise par fir bhi nahi maana. Gamer to the core. Then we started playing volleyball as well and he is good at that as well. Mahaveer aur iska hamesha chhattees  ka aankda rehta hai volleyball mein. Thode din agar CS ya volleyball na khelo to banda pareshan ho jata hai. He is very clean at heart and a very well natured guy. Keep rocking dude. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I'll remember Dandu as my sweet neighbour in class who always had a smile on. We shared a PC in workspace. While Bajaj and I were just interested in browsing and programming, Dandu kept playing around with and changing the configurations and Linux versions of the PC- so much so, that we'd often had to work on another PC!! He was never sincere with his assignments, did it all in the last minute- but did it quite well. Hence I was surprised when he did not get placed for so much time.<br><br>By virtue of being class neighbours, we have had a lot of interactions, and I've found him to be a very laid back person. Hes quite friendly though, and is always the victim of leg pulling in his gang <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . It was fun sitting together and getting frustrated in classes <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>May God bless.<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part4:<br>There are a few more things to Kiran's character that I would like to add. <br>He's like 'George' in 'Curious George'. He like to pry into others' computers. I remember this incident that took place in the 1st year. One day i came to his room and he told me that he had installed a keylogger in Rishi's computer and that he could log in to yahoo! messenger from Rishi's account. Rishi came to know about what he had done and got very angry. The very night Rishi apparently came after Kiran with a stump in his hand, but thanks to the efforts of Kiran's floor mates that he was saved. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dandu .. Banda bond hai gaming mein .....

<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 3:<br>He is fond of watching movies that have a "good story". Huh! Not once has he suggested me a good movie. Once I asked him to suggest a good horror film "jise dekh kar darr lage" and he recommended "The Orphanage" <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . If the movies that I like form set A and the movies he likes form set B, then the union of set A and B will be a universal set and the intersection would be null. Huff!<br><br>Having said all these things about Kiran, I would like to add a few more things before concluding. He is very sharp (he studies just a few hours before any exam and yet scores more marks than me), he is ingenuous (people like him are hard to find now a days), he can crack PJs and that too iPJs (complex ones <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). <br>Kiran it has been good to know you and have you as a friend and I know we will remain friends for life because you do not have anger issues neither are you short tempered. I wish you all the best for your future.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2:<br>General Traits:<br>He is a geek of sorts. He loves to keep himself updated with the latest technology products that come into the market. He knows which linux destro offers what. There was a time when he would install an OS almost every second day. And this did not go for a week for two, but for almost a year. ( Kiran, do you disagree? ). Despite of him being a geek, he prefers Windows over Linux. Amazing! <br>He is also and avid gamer and also loves to read about them. I am sure he has played more games than anyone else in IIIT. <br>The letters c and s find a special place in his heart, because they combine to form "cs" which stands for coffee shop and also for counter strike. He is ready for both any time of the day (except when he is sleeping). <br>He sleeps a lot and that too at odd hours. <br><br>Not so general traits:<br>He loves good food and especially non-veg food. He is always ready to go out for dinner, except when he is running low on cash. <br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1:<br><br>I know Kiran since the first year of college, but we became friends only after the second semester. If I correctly remember I first interacted with him during one of our practice sessions for the freshers day. <br>( He played a PTI and that too a very funny one ). <br><br>Shot to fame:<br>Kiran shot to fame in the second semester, when he asked Prof. Govidrajulu if he wanted "PROOF". Until then I had no inkling that he had so much guts. (It requires guts to ask a Professor of that stature such a question and that too in front of a class of more than a 100 students. Does it not?).After that incident,"Do you want proof?" became his second name. <br><br>Change in 4 years:<br>Kiran has changed little in these 4 years in college. <br>1)He was a geek then, he is a geek now. <br>2)He was a foodie then, he is a foodie now. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>17271)He did not attend classes then, he does not attend classes now. <br> and the list still continues...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dandu...one of the most innocent persons of our batch. 3 years we lived on the same floor. He was the only one having PC in 1st semester... so many movies n some exclusive 'stuff' <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> we hv watched in his room <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . A pro of computer knowledge. <br>His mind is very sharp.... when it comes to competitions and puzzles ....he is really a fodu. He is fond of watching movies. DC ki Kisi bhi movie ke bare me poochlo sab pta rehta hai ise. Crazy for computer games... whenever I entered in his room either he is sleeping or playing some game or downloading something. One of the most <br>dedicated downloaders of our Batch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br>When he is sleeping ....doesn't matter how much u know ...he won't open the door until <br>u start beating ur head with frustration <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . <br>In the beginning of every semester he aims to get SGPA 9+ ...but as days passes he comes back to his original life style <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I m damn sure ....if he'd hv taken academics seriously ...he might be one of the toppers of our batch. <br>He was my BTP partner. Starting me isse kam karwana he ek BTP ke equal tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But in last semester he has done most of the BTP work <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . EverReady for outings and coffee shop . He is really a calm guy , I hv never seen him losing his temper.  In the beginning ... he is not fluent in Hindi.... and we all used to speak in Hindi...so sometimes there were very funny situations with him. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . South indian hai fir bhi telgu dhang se nahi aati <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>An incident I remember - <br>we were playing holi .... and he was running to catch me with a mug full of color ...he threw the color .... but i got escaped .... <br>As he missed the target Instantly he said - sorry <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>He is really a nice friend. <br><br>Some memories- <br>BTP <br>Building Science course <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>NBH 3rd floor <br>Outings <br>Movies in ur room <br>Coffee shop <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Congratulations for Dell <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br><br>"Hyderabad ke nawab hum denge jawab". Well this was the name of our team in Sunday carnival eQuiz. We were not prepared but since other guys didn;t turn up by the time we thought of making up a team by ourselves and we took part. Bingo! We won.<br><br>Dandooz is the most awesome clue maker, puzzle solver I've ever seen in my life. Right from the days of first year, he used to particiate in  all Cache in and KK competitions and receive accolades for his puzzle cracking capabilities. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to this talent of yours dude.<br><br>He seems like an ordinary guy but has a lot of knowledge about different games, gadgets and technical stuff. He also maintains a huge movie database and I'm pretty sure that whenever he's with you while playing DumbC, this guy can make the other team members shit in their pants. So I always chose to be on his side. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>During 3rd year inter house DumbC, this guy told the name of some book which nobody (except the organizers)  knew and everyone was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Your knowledge in books is comparable to none man.<br><br>Well, there are many awesome moments that I share with him. But today, I'm not able to recollect any of those.<br><br>Will miss you a lot buddy. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> for your awesomeness and cool character.<br><br>Keep rocking as ever and all the best for your future.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kiran Danduprulo, is one of the best gamer of our batch. I think he played everygame atleast once. He downloads them and completes them at the quickest. He and Mathur are the two who are responsible for everyone playing CS nowadays. He keep insisting and often gives you senti like "For friendship sake, play naa"<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and you ought to play looking at his honest,innocent request <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. In CZ, he is God <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <b>Gargoyle,Grolag,pegasus</b> are few nicks , one has to be careful of. <br>	Apart from gaming another thing he is brilliant is troubleshooting of PC malfunctions.Has so many CDs of different linux <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Dell service center ke liye best hoga banda <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Right from first year he is crazy about d/ling  things, intially I used to bug him for many movies I intent to see, although he managed to d/l only few of them <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Games to saare yahin d/l karta tha.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br>	Recently, volleyball ka bhoot lga hain bande ko.Always ready for that.

<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kiran aka dandu, the wikipedia of computer games and Hollywood movies <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Ask him about any game .. he will surely tell you how to begin and how to end the game. He has spent sleepless nights to complete the games. He prefers playing games over attending classes <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>He is very friendly ... and we use to spend a lot of time together in 1st and 2nd year. If I wanted to go to CS for tea or something .. I use to ping him to go along and I always gets a YES as the answer. He got a PC in 1st year and we use to watch movies and other stuff in his room <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>You can always find him in a very light mood ... it can be regarding anything ... from studies to placements <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He never allows any kind of tension to build up around him. With three things he can spend his whole life CS, Laptop and Internet. He has good knowledge about Computers and is very good at programming but he hardly uses it <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br><br>He is really good at DumbC as he knows about each and every HollyWood movie. One of the best players when it comes to CZ (pegasus the shooter <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). He is very efficient in every work ... he has got the brains when it comes to the studies .. but always prefer to use them in games rather than in studies <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>It is very difficult to wake him up while he is sleeping.. I tried it a few times in 1st year when we had to go to class but I hardly got any success. But he is really good at heart and is very honest. <br><br>If you want to go out for lunch or dinner and don't find anybody to go along then you can always ping dandu and I am sure the answer will always be YES <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. You never have to convince him to go out for lunch or dinner .. he is always ready for that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is the only South Indian in our group but he doesn't know Telugu .. every time gets confused about the words. But the way sometimes he answers a few things makes us laugh alot. The way he speaks Hindi is really funny <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Best of Luck for your future and always be in touch </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dandu, Gargoyle aka Pegasus, I know him sence he did the role of PTI ( hip rotation) during our freshers <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a pro when it comes to computer games. Extremely good in CZ <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I always prefer to be in his team <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I don't think anyone in our plays more games than him. <br><br>Very friendly in nature, always ready to help you (if he is not sleeping, else he'll neither open the door, nor pick up your call)<br><br>The only South Indian in our group, he is extremely enthusiastic about playing. We have seen lots of movies, <i>stuff</i> and played many games in 1st year in his room, since only he has got a desktop. He never said NO. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>He has seen a lot of Hollywood movies and is having a huge database of movies in his mind. Knows IMDB rating of almost every movie <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Once, we were playing DumbC, one of our friend(who was acting) just gave hint that it is a 6 lettered english movie...Instanly Dandu said "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", and guess wht, it was correct. We all were like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Always ready to go to Coffee Shop, or any place outside to eat...and gets the highest bill among all of us. The only thing I don;t like about him is, he rarely takes bath. Isliye holi bhi nahi khelta <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He is a very good programmer too and has a vast knowledge about computer and its peripherals. All the best Dandu for your future. Hope you will be placed soon. Be in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
