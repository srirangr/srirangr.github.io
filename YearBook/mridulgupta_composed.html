<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sanket 'Market' Sharma alias Daddu, is <i>the</i> most talked about guy of our batch. Bring anything up on the discussion table, his name is sure to crop up. We've shared relationship has been very eccentric all these years. More of a blow hot - blow cold type. Umpteen times there have been quarrels, tiffs, arguments etc. over a lot of issues between the two of us. Difference of opinion has been the bottom line of each and every one of our 'discussions'. <br><br>I remember him saying one thing to me - 'When our college days would become numbered, no matter how many arguments there might have been between us, all of these would be forgotten in those times of nostalgia'. I must say you were very correct that day <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I look back at those days and laugh at the arguments we've had. It all seems so laughable now. <br><br>He is someone who've I've admired for his managerial skills. No event is possible in IIIT without him being a part of it. Felicity, Placements, Batch trips etc. he's done them all. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Also his commitment during placements has been really worth appreciating. Even after getting placed,  he took a number of tutorials to teach many of us. The concern he showed about me getting placed was really heart-warming. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He is one of the very very few guys of our batch who can build a great career in politics if he wishes to (Give this option a serious thought, offer letter from Bank of America is still pending <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). On that note, I would like to advise you to be a little less politically correct. Speak you heart out and you'll do just as great. Being  measured and calculated always doesn't help. Let your heart speak for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>Well, it has truly been wonderful being your friend knowing that there would always be a helping hand from your side. A guy who knows how to handle different types of people <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. It is a great quality dude, one that I have always longed to learn but have not quite done it.<br><br>Here's wishing you all the very best for the future (I know you'll be pretty successful in what ever you do).<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Khurana, the quintessential studious and the most diligent guy of our batch <img src=Smileys/26.gif />. Almost seem to be amazed by his gargantuan capacity to study for long hours <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The know-it-all guy when it comes to academics. He is the topper of our batch which is no mean achievement <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Hats off to you on that buddy. The way he manages his time for studies and other activities is stupendous. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Narrowly missed calls from the top three IIMs (got admits from IIFT and IIM-S), I am sure this time would be different. <br><br>Another streak in him, which not many people pf our batch know about is liking for adventure. He's been on trekking, camping, spent nights out on the New Year and has done a lot of acts of daredevilry.  Always ready for a slog, waiting to go on any adventurous trip that comes along.<br><br>All in all, a good friend of mine. Hope you fulfill your dreams (which should be no big deal for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) and have a great time ahead (in IIMs).</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the very few guys who can truly lay claim on being an allrounder. Acads, music, sports, dance, computer gaming this guy has been there and done that. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. There's a famous saying, Jack of all trades, master of none. In case of Atul, it is just the opposite. Atul DVD aka dude aka Atul ra, is one of my good friends in IIIT. Got to know him better during the fourth year, and thoroughly enjoyed BC sessions with him at the coffee shop. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is the one who started IIIT's first and only rock band, Avant Garde. The only guy to have played the Tabla and Dholak to entertain none other than President Kalam. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Hats off to you dude. He is real nice person at heart who never lets his friends down. In fact, friends revel in his company and are most amazed by his uncanny knack of coming up with quick-witted responses. Truly hilarious are they <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>This guy also has an attitude made of steel which came to the fore during placements. Even during these tense times, he managed to get a great <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> job at CapitalIQ. Kudos to you on that mate <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>It has been great being your friend and hope that it would stay the same. All the best for your future and hope you scale great heights and achieve your biggest of dreams <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dhingra.html>Hemant Dhingra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Well, if there exists a word that defines him, it is - passion. One of the earliest friends I made in IIIT, Dhingra, is one of the most passionate guys I've come across in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. The perfect embodiment of an undergrad college guy. Good at studies, even better at sports (as a player and spectator), and second to none when it comes to doing BC. He is one with a very soft heart which is obvious given his passion. A Proud owner of a Yamaha FZ-16, prefers to use public transport, keeping his machine in the shed <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Dhingra is absolutely mad, quite literally,(and I mean it) about movies. Snapping his fingers with great vigor , turns up in my room every Friday asking (almost pleading) for me to go watch a movie with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>I am amazed by his I-don't-care-a-dime attitude and his self-belief <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. No matter what, he would always follow his heart. A really smart and intelligent bloke who puts his heart and soul in every thing he does. He has been a great  source of inspiration for me in this regard. Always the one who revs things up. He is one of the few guys bubbling with positive energy.<br><br>He is really passionate, here comes the word again, about his friends and would presumably do anything for them <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Shares a great camaraderie with his pals.<br><br>We've had a roller coaster ride all these years and have shared some of the most memorable moments in college <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. There've been some differences between us but that is expected in a long relationship such as this. Hope you stay the way you are and achieve great success in all your future (and present) endeavors.<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the most talked about guys of our batch, so much has been written and said about him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, there's nothing much left for me to write. Anyways here goes one for our beloved Kabra. A great guy to be with, with a fondness for cracking jokes and laughing on it, there's always something on in his mind. (A great trait to have by the way <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Although sometimes gets a bit too much for him that which (un)fortunately comes out of his mouth And when it comes it just doesn't stop <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I hope you get what I am trying to say. Sample this, Abey!!! EPL kya hai? EPL mein koun koun hai?? EPL kahaan hoti hai?? Though it does sound irksome to many a person, I take that with a different view. It is the sheer innocence with which this guy shoots up questions, that you can't help but try and come with an answer much to his liking <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Just hope his 'curiosity' sustains itself for a long time to come, otherwise Kabra wouldn't be himself <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>A never-say-die attitude is something that defines him. Be it academics, his love interests <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> he is prepared to put in the hard yards. A real hard working guy <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, is always prepared for a slog <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. It is this quality which one can find in him in abundance. Hats off for this, dude <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Talk about dedication and perseverance.<br><br>Off late, he has emerged as a dark horse with respect to girls. Has made a girlfriend with more of them in the waiting <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He recently arranged a conference chat with all his 'chhamiyas' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Casanova in the truest sense. <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br><br>It has been a wonderful journey all these years that we've spent in college and hope that it lasts longer now that we'll be living in the same apartment. On that note, a piece of advice, please  be a little less frugal <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, you are now a (big) buck earning guy <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Well, one of the very few people in our batch to whom one could open his/her heart out. One of the best poets of our batch, Sainani has been a good friend of mine. All that crap we've talked about in your room at night has been really memorable. The best part was neither of us knew why we talked about such things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (I might be wrong in his case though). I love pissing him off <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> because he is one guy who hardly loses his cool. Mostly, it is the other way round with him when it comes to pissing someone off ('Fattas' et el) <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Love it when he goes crazy listening to my wonderful <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> imitation of Kabra's voice (disgusting in his opinion).<br><br>Well, on to some serious stuff. Sainani is an extremely hard working guy whom one would find always hooked onto his laptop. Famous for taking one of the toughest (and of high intellect) courses and getting A's, he has a never say die which I really like about him. No matter how many problems he has in life (which he rarely discloses) he still manages to come out fighting. <br>I admire his literary prowess and must say that he is among the best in our batch. Writing prose/poetry is one thing but appreciating it is another. Here is one guy who can do both with great panache and flair (You'll do great as a literary critic <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The best way to know about him is to read his works in poetry. So efficient at reading research papers, I am sure you'll be one heck of a researcher one day. We've had a very idiosyncratic relationship relationship but it has been fun being friends.<br><br>All the best for the future buddy and hope that you soon zero in on a research topic and get your MS.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Maglu... one of the most popular 'dulla' of our batch <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Is a great guy to be with. A hard core fan of the Australian Cricket team who still believes they're the no. 1 side <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (I share the same sentiment <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. We have had a blast of a time all these years doing lots and lots of BC, imitating Kabra's voice and with plenty of eSagu v/s LTRC bickering. eSagu's real researcher and its go-to guy (eSagu is run by Maglu ... or so he says <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). If anyone does research at eSagu it is none other than him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. (Join LTRC dude <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Apart from the obvious research talent, he's pretty smart and intelligent <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. (Doesn't have an F in his 'kundali' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). This guy is mad about girls but unfortunately has no girlfriend(s), hence christened 'tharkee' <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Perhaps the only person who doesn't remember the name of the hero of a movie after watching it. <br>Dreams about dating Elisha Cuthbert, Katrina, Hilary Duff and others in his never ending list. <br><br>He is someone who never backs out and is always ready for a fight. No matter what, does not budge in any situation. Try saying something about his native place (Sri) Ganganagar and pat comes the reply. Poor guy, has to contend with the whole batch whenever Australia loses (which is happening  more often than not these days, much to his dislike). <br><br>All in all, a fab person with never a dull moment in his life (research, girls, Australia et al <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) with a great sense of humor.<br>All the best pal for your future. Hope you finish your MS next year (with publications <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and crack CAT and also intern and work at Microsoft (Redmond)<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bajaj aka KBC is one of the best guys one would find to do BC with <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. My first impression of him was that of a guy who could only study and study more <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif />..... <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I remember him coding his ass off during the second and third semester (obviously got lots of A's <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)and wondered how could he study so much even greatest qualities in college <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif />??? But as time passed by, I got to know him better ........... <br>One of his greatest trait apart from acads <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> was his ability to play bsktball (one of the best in our collg)...... poor guy had to carry the weight of his team (Vayu <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) on his shoulders <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ........ and even though his team lost, his performance and passion never dipped.... as amazing as ever <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />........ He is one of the most passionate guys in our batch when it comes to sports....... his heart beats for his team (hence made UG-4 bball captain) <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .......... <br><br>One thing I have to admit is his dedication and devotion towards anything he does....... I remember how hard he had prepared for placements........ used to take a number of tutes clarifying others' doubts (Kabra's too <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and also landed himself a plush job in amazon <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> in these times of recession......... you can't help but admire his dedication for the same <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. he was among the first few guys placed in our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>Talking of dedication, KBC is one of the most dedicated viewer of TV series and movies...... talk of any TV series and he has seen 'em all...... biggest fan alive of FRIENDS (has watched each episode at least 10 times <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />............<br><br>Kudos to your dedication and commitment buddy ....... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />......<br><br>Over these years we've become gr8 buddies and have enjoyed the outings we've had (yeah it's true that I have to always give in to the popular demand when going out <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) Hope you go places which I am sure you will.......<br>All the best buddy for the future........</b></i></ul><br><br>
