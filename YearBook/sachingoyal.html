<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Don't remember when I first met him, but remember his great collection of movies under the name Icshan in DC++. He has spent his life in IIIT, both as a successful downloader, as well as a successful gamer (both online and onfield).<br>He's a great guy, fun loving and a great peer. His friends love him a lot!!<br>I like his freestyle attitude a lot! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Lately I have realized/learnt that he's quite a sensitive person as well. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He loves doing gossip and is a great watcher (I mean movies and TV shows. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ).<br>He used to threaten Mohit for a good grade in DWDM! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kabeer.html>Kabeer Singh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>aka bindaas ekdum bindaas banda , tension nahi lene ka.<br>He was my first friend in IIIT. We took a room in cellar and that's when it all started. Raat bhar BC in saini's room, long walks, Punjabi Rasoi, Banga ko tang karna, movies in Akansh bhaiya's room, and so on.  Classes mein late aakar sirf phots leni <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>He is a good shooting guard with an excellent conversion rate. Isne agar apne area (60deg to 120deg) se shot maari , to jayegi jayegi.  <br>Bahut aalsi banda hai , mast coding karta hai aur haan CZ mein I_AM_HERE banke bahut maara hai isme mujhe.<br>Talk about movies , hindi or English, new or old , sab dekhi hai isne.

<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is one fo the chocolate boys of IIIT. I wonder how jrs missed him in that category. We have done NLP project. I managed to get a reasonable grade only because of him. He gave instinctive answers in the presentation. We played cricket in OBH and when he hits six he gives a peculiar childish, innocent smile like that of SRT.  He has great communications skills and knowledge. Because of that he cleared interview in the first attempt.<br>                   My best wishes for your better future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Another thing to notice about him is his knowledge about movies/songs etc. He's watched more movies then I know the names of and has knowledge of almost all the hindi songs of recent times. Usually wins in Antakshari, Dumbcharads and such competitions all the time. I wish he was from Vayu house <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>I think he's really emotional at the core. You can know about it from his activities after he gets drunk ;-), although I havent had a chance to be with him during any of those occasions, but thats what others say <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is also one of the guys who will help me whenever I need it. Remember that Veshno Devi trip, I was too slow in climbing and he was the one who stayed with me for most of the time and encouraged me to complete it <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Many thanks for that buddy <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br><br>I hope I will come to blore soon and we'll see each other as often as in college <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Will Miss you for: AOE/BC <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Most Memorable Moments: Veshno Devi Trip, Summer 07 fun and everyday BC.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Sachin Goyal ( nick: icsahn ), also known as Keechad-Kood ( KK in short ) is a very friendly person. He really likes to enjoy his life and is a great person to make friends with. Its usually a lot of fun when he's around.<br><br>I first met him in first year because of AOE <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. We used to play lots of games in first year. Still remember those days <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I didnt have much interaction with him apart from playing AOE together. 2 years passed like this.<br><br>Then came summer 2007, I had more interaction with him. We and other friends used to spend major part of the day ( except sleeping time ) together playing CS all night, then playing VB in the morning. Eating a heavy breakfast, sleeping and then getting up to do BC at college and going to some nice place for dinner, and back to CS again. Those were some of the best fun filled days I had in college. He's an extremely good CS player and I could never match with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>Then comes third year, I shifted to NBH and took a room in front of his room. We have done some AOE and CS gaming together at room as well. I've been to many outings with him he's always ready to have fun with friends and a very jolly person.<br><br>Now in forth year, we have played lots of card games together <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Specially 29. He's really good at this game too.<br><br>Irrespective of all the fun, he's also pretty much a brainy guy. He likes to solve puzzles ( participated in all the cache-in during the various felicities that we had in our stay ). It is also supported by the fact that he managed to get a very good job even during these hard times. [ Don't worry you'll get your offer letter <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ].<br><br>One thing that we both match in is our laziness. Although people might argue ki I'm more lazy but yeh bhi kam nahi hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He never likes to be waken up in his sleep, gets really angry when someone does that to him unnecessarily or even with a reason <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[Part 2 of 2]<br><br>It is due to him that I had my only Paintball experience in Felicity during our 2nd year. [It was one moment I will cherish because it was unique]. His coolness can be seen in his dance which he did right before Venkaiah sir after he was assured that he will be given a average-to-minimum grade.<br><br>This guy was quite depressed by the fact that I was the only one who hasnt been placed yet and adviced me to do different things and ask help if necessary. All his good wishes and also others have come true when I got placed in DELL. He is quite helpful and is ready to help when needed. His talent is BB is also worth talking because he is by far the best shooter I have seen in IIIT.<br><br>And now that you are staying with Rahul I believe we will be in touch and Plz be careful of Rahul as he has learnt the art of Instantaneous Black Magic <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He will make sure that CITRIX wont cheat you so you have nothing to worry about financially. Wishing u all the best @ CITRIX and Bangalore ... Signing off ... Kiran Danduprolu. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[Part 1 of 2]<br>Sachin Goyal is one heck of a cool guy u'll ever see. I met him through kapil and Sambhav in NBH Cellar and soon we got along without any problem and I really admire his kind of life. He enjoys his life to the fullest without going down on other things. [Which can be best seen in the fact that he was placed far earlier than others in CITRIX].<br><br>He watches so many movies that even a movie addict like me should bow down to the master <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I love irritating this guy in dumb-c by giving the weirdest movie names to his teammates while enacting. His love for old classics made him a very famous downloader in 2nd Yr [Everyone knew Icsahn the downloader at that time in DC]. His movie reviews are quite good and very accurate.<br><br>He enjoys having fun to the core and is always ready for any kind of BC/fun/sport/Gaming Activity. An excellent AOE and CS player he is and I m afraid of him in both games[this is a secret] [Please do show "Mercy" on me in these games].  <br><br>He is also a gr8 singer with a vast knowledge of Hindi songs and hence has won Antakshiri events many times in these 4 years. Of late he has been interested in Telugu songs too [appudo ippudo from Bomarillu is his favorite <img src=Smileys/10.gif />].</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I wld like to share my experience on d day whn Citri<img src=Smileys/14.gif />Cit) and CpitalIQ(Cap) were on d campus for recruitment. Sachin and rahul were both shortlisted in both d companies for interviews. I was handling Cap and Adi was looking after Cit people. Sachin was in his 2nd round of interview wid Cit and d Cap people were looking 4 him. I had delayed his interview sending in others in d queue. Worries and thoughts had crept in my mind<img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Sachin finished his 2nd round wid Cit. I smwhat wanted him to get through in Cit and not Cap. I thn called him for his interview with Cap. He came thr...Adi told me Sachin can hv his 3rd round wid Cit. I was in a fix <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> shld I send him thr. Thr was a lil room to make Cap people wait.So Sachin went back to attend his 3rd round at Cit. Now it went a bit far delaying his int. wid Cap. But he was in d middle of his int on d other side. I was feeling guilty <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. By d time Sachin finished his int at Cit, 1st round team for Cap had left. I kept dis secret 4m Sachin. And by God's grace after his 3rd round he was immediately asked for his 4th round wid Cit. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. After his 4th round at Cit, I told him tht he was no longer considered for Cap. But he was cool and happy wid his performance wid Cit. Now, I became even more desperate for his selection at Cit. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>And thr was another thorn in d way. Rahul was in d final rounds of both d companies <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. It seemed he would get an offer from both. Chances were strong tht Cit would give only 1 offer. Results were being discussed by Cit people. Rahul was in his final HR round at Cap. There was an argument b/w me and Adi abt wat course of action to take in d various cases arising of d situation. Finally d news came tht both Rahul and Sachin were offered a job by Cit <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. It was a huge relief for me. I ran down to d room whr Rahul was being interviewed and told d Cp people tht he's no longer available 4 dem. I can't really express my happiness at tht time <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But yes, dis was d time when i had tried to be biased.</b></i></ul><br><br>

I first met this guy in cellar with Pankaj, Ojasvi, Kabeer etc. We gave ragging together (Remember that song sung by me and you were continuously saying "Wah Wah" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .... quite hilarious that was <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Initially, I got a wrong image of him and found him a bit arrogant jisko bas har ek ke maje lene mein hi maza aata hai. But how wrong I was ! This guy is very sharp and I came to know about it when I heard his result for mid-sem1 of C-programming. His placement is also a testimony to this fact. Movies ka to chalta-firta wikipedia hai. Ye aur Ranga jab ek team mein ho jayein to inhe koi hara nahi sakta. Abhi mahashay bcbaaz to hain hi. Is time antyakshari mein sirf isiliye part nahi liya taki sab doston ke saath baith kar bc kar sakein aur har participant ki jam kar uda sakein <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Ye, bajju, Paro, Atul vagarah kuch bhi bc karte hain mailing list par. Basketball bhi mast khelta hai. I didn't interact with him much in first 3 years and I'll definitely regret that. But fourth year has given me a lot of memories to cherish. Playing TT, volleyball and especially CS together and doing bc especially in all the events like Cult night, Felicity etc, doing acting of taking headshots of each other from time to time, his fun loving attitude, a lot of things are there. Now, we are really good friends. I'll just say that "This guy is awesome". Bangalore jakar bhool mat jaiyo aur touch mein rahiyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Keep rocking dude. May God give you all the happiness and success in your life. Hope our friendship grows stronger with time (as we have to make up for the first 3 years as well <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Though I witnessed only few BC sessions..as people have impression here I don't do BC <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> But I came more in his contact in kerala trip that we had in second year. It was his plan, his management, his company..that made that trip a huge memorabilia. He has a very peculiar way of having fun. Picking a murga and then "uski taang kheenchna", doing in limit.Hate cracking PJs and even listening to them, he only needs pure fun, pure BC. <br>I indeed admire your cool nature. He doesn't give a damn about anything. Everything he does is what his heart prompted. I have seen him always happy and spreading the smile around as if saying "sun yaar chill maar". And he understands people very well..knows their comfort zone..and try to suit and mingle accordingly.<br>He is good coder and has got oodles of brains which he don't think wise enough to use in study. yeah  I rem, during placement dayz I was so nervous when I screwed in some interviews. I grew superstitious too.. after he was selected for citrix I borrowed his shirt...it happened to be so lucky that in  next interview I cracked..*abhi tak nahi lautai yaar, har baar bhool jaata hoon* <br>I am so happy that we landed in the same city. I din had the much pleasure to be in his friendly company in colg... I only observed him as friendly, "dil ka nek" guy. But I guess in Bangalore we will simply rock.

I think he loves traveling and that thing match with me ... so when ever I think of going on a trip, he is my first choice ... always enthusiastic <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> about going to one or the other place <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and he rarely back out from the trip <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>He was in the cellar NBH right from the 1st year but I hardly knew him at that time ... either he use to stay in the room (still prefers to do the same <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) .. or play AOE in the lab. When it comes to the games .. he is one of the best player in CZ and AOE. Once I saw him playing AOE in lab .. I got inspired and started playing AOE but even today I couldn't match his level <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. <br><br>He is a wikipedia of Bollywood movies and songs <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and also watches a lot of TV Serials. When ever I needed any movie then he is my first choice who can help as he has a lot of DVDs full of movies and also suggests me those movies that are of my interest (especially comedy or having beautiful bandi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). He is the permanent member of the winning team of Antakshri <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>The most unforgetable moments were the trips to Kerala, Sikkim and Vaishno Devi .. and he is such a good entertainer, never let u feel bored <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is also good at playing cards and it was one of the source of entertainment in trips. He is always full of enthusiasm during the whole trip and tries to get the best outcome from the trip. Thanks to Sachin for the last day of the Kerala trip when he planned to see synagogue <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> otherwise we would have missed a lot of things.<br><br>He has a peculiar style of walking because of which he has got the name 'KK' and always misspells s as sh and vice versa <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is also good at BC but mostly prefers to stay in his room so he misses out many BC sessions. He is true lover of Pizza .. anywhere anytime <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is going to Bangalore so I think i m going to miss my trip partner <img src=Smileys/20.gif />.

Like all those kids from the corporate college hostel hells, I thought that he's probably a maggu. But I was wrong.. A perception completely changed about such guys <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I found Sachin a cool and laid back chap. Just like his gtalk id suggests <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But whats with the 13 dude? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>A lot of my interactions with him took place in the cellar, where I lived in my second year. I remember him as the pizza and sleep chap.. Always wanted one of these two! Add to it his long hair, unique way of leofying and an out-of-the-way style of walking and you have a terrific combo <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But well, he proved that he has a lot of substance in him during the placement season. I remember sitting together for the Citrix interview, how we described our interviews to <br>each other and how he managed to crack one of the best companies. Cheers for that, mate!<br><br>The first time I was sloshed, I remember crying a lot. And he was one of the guys whose shoulder I used for the support. That was a day when we all got senti, and I told him ki, "Tum cellar waalon hum logon ke saath kabhi nahi ghumte.. kabhi humse baat nahi karne aate. Tum hum sab se nafrat karte ho" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I'm all smiles when I look back at that moment today <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Dude, we still have those parties pending, where we've promised to booze together. I am sure we'll have one helluva party!<br><br>Apart from all that, Sachin's also a good friend for people around him. Dependable and trustworthy, he also enjoys having a good time. Eighth semester, of course, has taken us to the heights of vellahpanti, and ain't he the first one to be loving it? <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ahh..

Salla kumbhkaran bhi sharma jaye <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He has a sharp learning curve and it was fun playing all sort of pc games with him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is real pro in small flash games( had the best highscore in all of them <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ). Big time movie freak ( I think he has watched the highest no of movies in IIIT, though I told him a lot but never tried anime <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> ) He has watched DDlJ like a 100 times <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>Coming to skills he is good in acads ( smart study personified, he is known to get more marks then people who teach him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I think he even had 2 marks more then me in physics 2 <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> which I taught ), awesome in bc and unbelievable in making friends.

I had my CAT.. he had nothing but placements.. we both made many a schedules to start our prep.. but I never remain true to any of those schedules.. but thankfully he did.. I was more certain of his cracking his first interview than my cracking my IIMs interview (if I got a call <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) .. and that he did prove <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ...<br><br>before I say anything else... I shud mention certain trends that we followed over the 4 years of stay here... we both have given 'food' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  priority over anything else.. so wud like to mention the same here... in the 1st and 2nd semester it used to be 'punjabi rasoi' and 'eat street' ... then in the 2nd year.. it was any random place <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. in the 5th semester it was the endless 'ordered in' pizzas... once-twice-thrice- and at times 4 times in a week <img src=Smileys/13.gif />  .. in the 6th semester it was the 'burgers', 'hotdogs' from the 'cakes n crisps' ... in the 7th semester it was 'Ginger Court' .. used to go there so often... that I've lost the count <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>of late there has been an addition of an addiction that's 'beer' <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> wudn't elaborate on that though <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <br><br><b>things I wud remember him for</b> endless discussions on topics as weird as the discussions themselves..... for never saying 'no' to an outing.. or walk around the campus be it at 3 or 4 in the morning <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. and the endless list of movies and TV serials we talk and fight about.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>continu</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>first impressions are not really trustworthy.. and therefore I avoid forming opinions on that basis.. Sachin was one of the few people whom I met very early in IIIT and the fact that he was a fellow-cellarian.. made sure that we got to spend a lot of time together... Sachin was there in my very first outing.. and ever since then.. it's hard to imagine any outing without him being around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... but more on that later.. let me first get to the starts..<br><br>I found him to be very lighthearted .. lighthearted to the extremes of being 'rude' and 'careless' towards 'emotions' at first... I mean as long as it was for fun.. he was always in.. but the moment the talks used to get a lil bit serious he wud be like " kyun pakka rahe ho yaar " .. I didn't like this attitude of his a lot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> but I kept my opinions to myself... and continued to be with him in all the discussions and fun and masti... and what resulted was.... that I changed in due course... and became a lot less 'whiny'<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> .. a lot less 'senti' .. and a lot more 'cool'<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... thanks to Sachin <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ..<br><br>It is said .. like attracts unlike.. but there have to some common 'likings' nonetheless <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. and it didn't take very to long for us to figure those out... we both were and still continue to be big time movie buffs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. <br><br>I remember the movies we used to watch in Akansh's room in the 1st semester.. 'Godfather' tops the list.. we watched the 1st and 2nd movie back to back... even though he was sleeping half way through the second movie <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>How faithfully we were devoted to 'punjabi rasoi' in the 1st year.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. I wudn't need to ask him twice if I wanted to go out.. he wud always be there... if we didn't go out... we wud order in.. and there was a time.. when we were ordering every second day.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>He has always been an integral part of all the pranks that I thought of and implemented <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... <br>As far as academics were concerned... he was and still is very good at 'programming' ... continued ....</b></i></ul><br><br>

First year me ek bhi English class nahi miss karta tha <img src=Smileys/26.gif />.. bahut mazaa aata tha har class me. Ye to thi first year ki baat ..<br><br>Second year me hum chal diye Kerala trip ke liye. Another unforgettable trip of my life. One thing I realized that things become more interesting if people around you are interesting. And Sachin is definitely one of the most interesting persons of our batch. Ooty ki masti ko kabhi bhula nahi paounga. Especially that incident - car wale ko jyada paise dekar pehle hi utar gaye aur pahadon par chalke utar ke aaye. Woh Ooty me boat me ghoomna. Simply Awesome.<br><br>Sabse awesome to Ooty to Coimbatore trip thi. Land sliding se saare routes band the. Us raat ko to phat ke haat me aa gayi thi hum sab ki. Aur tab Kapil ka phone aata hain "Kahan ho?" aur Sachin reply karta hain ki "Bus me. Zinda pahunch gaye to kal milenge" And we were like <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><br>And then comes the 3rd year. Cache in team partner. Bahut maze liye .. main thoda dukhi bhi hua tha ..but it was nothing when compared to the awesome mazaa we had in 2nd year trip. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. <br><br>1st interview main hi job maar lii .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Sunday carnival me mera Antakshari partner bhi tha .. bahut masti kii thi ..
