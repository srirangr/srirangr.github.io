<b><a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The other guy who I knew since 8 years... Right from the geeky hareen to kool hareen to gaming hareen .. I have seen all quarters of him. <br>Was my roomie in Intermediate and always with a bag full of snacks. Takes extreme care of neatness and is highly uninterested in working hard. Yes, he is smart enough to cover for the hardwork which was supposed to be done <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Highly intelligent guy with innocence that adds spice to his behavior. <br><br>But to the core-people, who know him really well, will surely know that he is not as innocent as looks. Used to crack awesome jokes on selected personalities <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>Used to draw his own boundaries, set his own rules and abide by them. The perfect example of how an ideal son should be <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Likes being lost somewhere in thoughts because that is what he does most of the times <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Buddy, You rock but be more active in social life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future,<br>Stay in touch as always,<br><br>cheers,<br>rohit <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
