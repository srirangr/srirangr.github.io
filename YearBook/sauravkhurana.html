<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Tune mera pahla testimonial uda diya par ye le ek aur <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is a very hardworking man. First year main hamari banti nahin thi. Dono hi short tempered hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> to gussa jaldi aa jata tha. Workspace main hum dono ka password change karna, computer share karna, isko guest privileges dekar pareshan karna <img src=Smileys/3.gif />... ab sochta hoon to bas muskura deta hoon.  First year main to isko dekhkar paseena aa jata tha, jab dekho tab library, jab dekho tab library...<img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>Vaise ek baat main sach bataoon, competitions ki tyari karte samay main bhi aisa hi tha <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He is a very emotional man. I can not forget when we all recorded a song for someone he love so much. Us din bahut maja aaya tha <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>Second year main mujhe lagta hai ki ninja ki vajah se main, adi aur akash group ke anya sadasyon ke sampark main aaye. Hum logon se probability to hilti nahin thi tab ninja aur saurav hi assignment tipate the <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Tabhi saurav se baat tabhi jyada baat honi shuru hui.<br>Coming to final year now I know that I can say anything to him and he will not piss off. Because now he understands me <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Ya jyada se jyada kah dega... "Tau tum....". Isne jis tarah se Renaissance-07 manage kiya tha that was commendable. Gajab ki baat to yeh hai ki Bharat aur isne co-ordination se kaam kiya <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Abke tune testimonial udaya to dekh liyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This one name khurana had fascinated me for long time. People used to give examples of him, padai karo to khurana ki tarah. Ye determination, dedication ka ek putla hai. I remember when he had first performed in AIMCAT and could not score well. But i could see the fire in him. Not just being the topper of ece or proving himself in studies, he has shown his talent in organising too with a successful robocamp. He loves travelling too. Always kept asking me if there is any trip in near future.<br><br>I never liked this man in my initial days, sorry to mention this. This is because of your attitude after diwali incident jab mera kurta jala diya tha. But he has changed quite a lot. He is much more mature and has become a helping hand to many. <br><br>You have inspired many in college and outside college with your determination and dedication.<br><br>Things will not miss trip to ettipothala waterfalls and new year party. There is lot more to write but time doesn't allow <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Initially I didn't communicate with him because it felt the right thing to do at that time. Later when we started talking, I found that we had a common friend who's my best friend from school days. Although we don't talk much but whatever I have learned about him by observing him from a distance is all obvious... he's hardworking, dedicated, 9 pointer etc. etc. which is good.<br>Himanshu, our common friend sometimes wonder and is amazed by the amount of change that has come in Saurav since school days when he was a mediocre student.<br>He often visited Atul for reading English together, that was the only time I<br>interacted with him in first two years.<br>I had a really good time with him and others in Tirupati last month, which is when I really got to know Khurana better. He initiated the trip and planned it out really well! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Although he is a bit stubborn sometimes, and gets into heated arguments, he does take care of important things and that's what I like about him. I arrived late at the scene when we had to leave for lingampally and board the MMTS, Khurana<br>was obviously bit nervous but was really calm with me and after initial frustration he suggested I have fun after we had boarded the MMTS 1 minute before it left the platform. During the Tirupati trip, he did get perturbed sometimes<br>because of Ninja and Subroto because of their casual and fun attitude and taking snaps at many different places without Khurana. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>one word which pops in mind when it comes to saurav khurana is 'padhakoo' <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I met him during the counseling session in kurukshetra... and he's looked equally sincere ever since <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>When it came to talk about ranks and results.. he asked me if I had 1st rank in State CEET.. as his was 2nd <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (I didn't sit for that exam) ..<br><br>He has been extremely focused since the very beginning.. knowing clearly what he has to do.. and his achievements showcase his dedication n hard work... <br><br>I still remember Khurana of the 2nd year, sitting in the library, reading newspaper like you read course books <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I feel kind of proud seeing two haryanvis Saurav and Manish Arora as the toppers of ECE and CSE respectively. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He has his own funda of enjoying life and having fun which is still not clear to me... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>But now as he is going to be in Banglore as well.. I hope he starts to have my kinda fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  and I start to have his kinda dedication <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>You no doubt have a very bright future... wishing you luck for ur life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>cheers !!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Khurana, the quintessential studious and the most diligent guy of our batch <img src=Smileys/26.gif />. Almost seem to be amazed by his gargantuan capacity to study for long hours <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The know-it-all guy when it comes to academics. He is the topper of our batch which is no mean achievement <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Hats off to you on that buddy. The way he manages his time for studies and other activities is stupendous. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Narrowly missed calls from the top three IIMs (got admits from IIFT and IIM-S), I am sure this time would be different. <br><br>Another streak in him, which not many people pf our batch know about is liking for adventure. He's been on trekking, camping, spent nights out on the New Year and has done a lot of acts of daredevilry.  Always ready for a slog, waiting to go on any adventurous trip that comes along.<br><br>All in all, a good friend of mine. Hope you fulfill your dreams (which should be no big deal for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) and have a great time ahead (in IIMs).</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Khurana. The hard working chap who doesn't give a damn to what others think about him and keeps working. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I still remember, in Felicity 06 on the day of Rock show, members of the rock group were drumming heavily and this guy was sitting in the library (which was exactly opposite to the Felicity ground) with his hands on his ears and concentrating on the studies <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Looks wise, he's quite smart. And also talented. His center was the same as my center while writing CAT and he was even studying in the cab in which we were supposed to leave. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. But the result was good. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Well, I've never seen him playing TT or cricket as mentioned in the hobby section. But I'm sure wherever he steps in, he does well coz he has the dedication to do things which is quite admirable <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future dude. It was awesome meeting you here in IIIT. Will remember you forever as the fodu-est student I've seen in my student life.<br><br>Love,<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If there is one person whos been a constant when it comes to his dedication for the things he want resisting all other temptations offered by college life, it has to be Khurana. July 2005, when he was in my wing. I'd always find him studying in the room or library, and I'd think, "Wow.. Amazing effort this chap puts in". Well fast forward to March 2009, and I was amazed, yet again, to see the dedication for the Economics course. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We were CAT buddies, and had quite a few discussions together. He, like Chethan always put in a good amount of effort into cracking the exam. Though he could not crack it this time around, I'm sure he'll do it sooner rather than later. He had an IIFT call, and cracked it <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . <br><br>He is also good for discussing stuff, dissects things logically and discusses points by merit. Hes got an amazing style of laughing, and its funny to see sometimes. <br><br>Wish you all the very best!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Asking you doubts when we were in the same wing. </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=yvsandeep.html>Sandeep Y V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Well this guy is truly unique.. He is THE acad guy, got first placed in IIIT...<br>He is usually present in the library... He is a genius... Maintaining an awesome cg along with getting calls from iim-s, xlri really takes a lot of dedication and hardwork... He is very sincere about his work..<br>I did not interact much with him till the last year.. only then i got to know him better... he has a great sense of humor and plans things well in advance for any trip.... He has helped me a lot while preparing for IIM interviews and gave me tips on how to improve my responses... <br>I had a wonderful learning experience with him while going to GD/PI classes... <br>You will definitely crack IIM-A next year... all the best dude...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Inko log Khurana ke naam se jaante hai...<br>I am always being the admirer of his hard work and can claim noone in college do so hard work <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Ye party se bhi aakar padai kar sakta hai. Toilet mein bhi newspaper le jaata hai. He missed dassi more than twice because he never gave us opportunity to score A <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. He is topper of our batch including CSE and ECE. Iski Organizational skills bhi kaafi acchi hai. He have organized robocamp, renaissance successfully. 3 cheers for the tirupati trip. (hip-2 hurray) -3 <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is perfect for MBA. Currently he got into IIM's and got a nice job in Nvidia <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>But aisa nahi hai ki Mr. khurana sirf padte hi rehte hai. Khelta bhi hai cricket,TT etc. Ek baar beech mein guitar ka shauk bhi chada tha shayad gf ne kahan tha.Phir hua tha guitar kaand  <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> jo ye apni gf ko bhejna chahte the. Inka subbo dwara modified joke. Jab doctor ne inhe A**S test ke lie bola tha mein to dar hi gaya tha but woh to timepaas tha <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Arguments ye to the point dete hai lekin kabhi-2 tone gadbada jaati hai. He used to be a short tempered guy but he have improved a lot <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Inka one of the favourite kaam hai subbo ko challenge karke haarna. Ek baar he also tried for CS lekin maja nahi lagta khurana ko khelke <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Kaiyon baar hamare jhagde bhi hue hai lekin jindagi isi ka naam hai <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br>If I hurt u anytime I'm extremely sry mein last jhagde mein shayad kuch extra hi bol dia <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.<br>Best of luck for ur future plans and be always my friend.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Jab bhi kisi ka kaatna ho ya fir apna katwane se bachana ho to tu tujhe zaruur yaad karunga. The assi-tussi-naal-wich guy who is always ready to have discussions/Fights with others, aur agar fights se bhi kaam na bane to Joke suna deta hai <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . One among the most confident guy in our grp, but gussa thoda jaldi aata hai, thts y I use to irritate u and watch the show <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> [ye bolna nahi chahta tha, otwise aage ke shows dekhne nahi milenge].<br>You are the one who really changed the way I look to the real life problems, I think it is because of you that I have this much confidence that I can handle any situation in my life whatever it may be , for any problem I just think that if u were there then what u wud have done, thts it, I do the same. You are just an awesome combination of brain and personality. I have never seen such a Hard working guy like u, I remember the days when you used to spent 10-12 hrs in a day for your MBA preparation, a true source of inspiration to me for my further studies. I still remember ... in the first sem once I had beaten u <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  .. since u and uma meri absent laga rahe the, abhi jab mein ye sab soochta hu to mujhe bhi hasi aata hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .

<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If someone asks me to define CONSISTENCY, then I won't take more than a nanosecond to speak out "SAURAV KHURANA, obviously yaar".<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> He is the epitome of CONSISTENCY.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Right from the first year, he is at the top in ECE batch.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> No one even dared to threaten his position.<img src=Smileys/51.gif /> If a student does outstandingly well in 1 or 2 sems, others congratulate him but when a student does outstandingly well throughout his college life, then after 2-3 semesters others stop congratulating him because CONGRATULATION lose its value in front of him. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>An analogy for the last statement is -<br>  "People living near Sandalwood forest does not value sandalwood as others do and use it as a fuel. In similar way, congratulation is the word that SAURAV KHURANA hears almost every week or month.

<b><a href=sagrawal.html>Shashank Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Aur bhai khurana...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Maine shayad hi kabhi ise Saurav kahaa ho. Shayad hi kise aur ne kahan ho <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is known and feared <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> as khurana.<br><br>Agar main ise sincere, hard-working, punctual kahoonga toh naraaz ho gayega <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Par koi nahin, ab toh keh hi diya. But there is one more way to look at it: he is an inspiring individual. His personality seems to say - have faith in yourself and you will be able to do anything in this world <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He enjoys to the fullest. When he is enjoying, he is enjoying. Cracks great jokes sometimes and sometimes really great ones. All in all he adds to the fun.<br><br>Bande ki achi knowledge hai aur strong opinions hai. He can manage things well and will be a great asset for whoever he works for.<br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

He helps you whenever possible.

And he commands everyone's respect for the amount of work he can put in for something.<br>No, no, he is not completely a nerd. He talks about girls too .. doosro ki mauj bhi leta hai. No one is clear about his love life status though. <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> When it comes to planning outings, yeh khoob uchal uchal kar plan karta hai.. <br>Baaki (K)BC bahut maarta hai. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Is ke jokes are famous .. and he is known for his 'weird' comments. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Remain the same!!

<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Saurav is the most dedicated person I have ever come across. He manages his time wonderfully and doesnt waste even a single moment. This guy has the capacity to study even after coming back from a party. Though we had a number of differences at various times he was always there in case you need any advice or help. <br>Playing table tennis with him is really fun. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> !! <br>A lot of times there are lot of misinterpretations on both our sides. Has wonderful conceptual clarity regarding anything that he is studying. A dependable friend. <br>His laugh and his jokes are his trade marks !! <br>I am sure you would achieve great heights in life !! <br>wish you luck for all your future endeavors !! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Iska naam hai Khurana... Saurav Khurana... He is the most hard working guy in our batch. First year mein to he was like studies, studies and more studies. But now he has learnt to loosen up a bit <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Lekin aisa nahin hai ki ab padhaai nahin karta. Actually he manages his time very well. Padhaai mein aisa hai ki agar koi prof. agar sirf ek A grade deta ho to baaki sab log A- ke liye hi prepare karte hain.<br><br>Ab yeh hum sab mein se sabse bada adventure seeker hai. Kahin ghoomne jao to jo kaam kisi ko nahin karna hota woh Khurana ko karna hota hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Debate karne ka ise khaas shauk hai. Agar ek baar Harsh ke saath shuru ho jaye hai to 1-1.5 ghante tak to chup nahin hota <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>College mein kisi bhi project ke liye agar maine khud kuchh mehnat ki hogi to woh Khurana ke kaaran hi ki hogi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Yeh khud to kaam karta hi tha aur mujhse bhi karvata tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. EW aur RnD ke projets ke liye jitna kaam humne kiya tha woh main kabhi nahin bhool sakta.<br><br>Sirf ek problem hai ki bolte waqt yeh sochta thoda kam hai. But I hope ki woh bhi time ke saath change ho jayega.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Har bar jab bhi koi nayi dress try karta hai to pics jaroor khichwata hai different differen poses main joki obviously mast hoti hai (maine khichi hoti hai to kharab kese ho sakti hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />).
