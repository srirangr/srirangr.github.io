<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>let me write about the coolest and sweetest guys I have ever seen. Let me write my impressions year wise.<br><br>1st year - a good junior to seniors<br><br>2nd year- a very active guy with many talents<br><br>3rd year- this is the year I came to know about him a lot. Initially I used to think, how can a man be so cool. He always had a smiling and glowing face. I was always amazed by it. How, How.<img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> I used to give it a lot of thought. and then we started talking. <br><br>Thats when I understood him. its his nature to be like that and thinking about it is useless <img src=Smileys/51.gif />. Then we slowly became friends. He used to tell me many things. I was amazed by his talent, skills and many things. He is the guy who manages everything. He enjoys a lot. Sangal loves him. and we all love him <br><br>4th year-  we became more close. He used to go to many places and I used to see his pics and enjoy thinking I wish I would be at that place. Even then he manages everything. He is a lover boy. Girls are crazy about him. Do you remember the intern who used to work under me. She used to ask about you always <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I will give her contact number if you are interested. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And the main thing is we are missing one of the coolest guys in LTRC. His knowlege on any subject is vast <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . I take many ideas from him whenever I am out of my ideas. Miss you buddy.<br><br>Hope I come to your company or you come to the place where I am working or studying.

This guy is very intelligent, sharp and versatile. Har jagah ye tinka udta hua mil jayega. He is very good at acads and has maintained a good CGPA throughout his engg. Isne mujhe graphics padhaya tha and he was damn good at that. Thanks a lot for that buddy. He is a very good singer. Tinke bhai ke saath kai baar inter-house singing mein part liya hai and we have won points as well. This guy is very creative. Hamare batch ki design team ka bhi part hai. He is a good organizer as well. The way he worked for Felicity deserves accolades. Har jagah BC mein shaamil rehta hai fir chahe vo CS mein ho ya volleyball mein ho ya fir kahin par bhi. Acting bhi awesome karta hai. You should see him doing that Matrix one. He is a fun loving guy who always wanna enjoy every bit of his life and remains happy. Be the same as you are tinke.

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sambhav bhai ke baare mein itna kuch hai bolne ke liye lekin bas words nahin mil rahe. For our batch he is like a cherry on the cake. He is the most versatile character I have seen. Be it acads, cultural, managemnet or organization, he has excelled himself in every field. For the faculty, he is among their most favourite students and he must be at the top in Sangal Sir's list <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He has been my neighbour for the first two years in cellar and we always used to talk whenever time permitted. He taught us Graphics and whatever marks I got, its all because of him. Thanx a lot for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Culturally he is just brilliant. When it comes to knowledge about hindi songs, no one can beat him. He has won many of the Antakshari events held here and organised many. A damn good singer and very hard working. Holds wonderful repo among the seniors and juniors. Within the batch itself, he holds a very special place. <br><br>I have done some courses with him and he just knows what to do to keep the faculty impressed <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He possesses very nice presentation skills and always finds a way to keep everyone engaged. A fun loving guy who is always there to make you smile. Very friendly and a cool gentleman. How can one forget the hard work he has put up for the placements though he was not placed initially. Knows how to talk to people and easily mingles with whatever group he is in.<br><br>I still wonders how did he screw his GRE because he worked very hard for that and I still believe that he'll make it big soon. I hope for the same <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Its been a nice journey with you mate and I can never forget you. Good luck for your future. Giod bless you.</b></i></ul><br><br>

He worked really hard when he was the head of the Cultural team of Aakash house <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is good in many games like cricket(with Paul Adams action <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), Volleyball and football and it is the perfect place to see his enthusiasm <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is the member of the placement committee and I think he has spend more time with Mr. Javadev as compared to any other person in the committee. He narrates the stories that he come across in meeting, in the best way <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>He did a lot of hard work in Felicity '08 and he was the one who decorated the whole campus and made it look really beautiful <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>He accompanied us on Sikkim trip and Vaishno Devi Trip and it was a gr8 pleasure to have him on the trip. He is a gr8 entertainer <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. That were the unforgetable moments of my life.<br><br>He got another name 'Tinka' as he can't stay at his place for a longer time. Thodi der mein udd leta hai ... and no one ever have a hint abt where he has gone or when he has gone <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He is always able to maintain a good image in everyone's mind and heart <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Don't know how he is able to do that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Everyone feels very comfortable in his company <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. The most unforgetable incident was the one happened in NTR whr he tried to propose a chinki <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Best of Luck for your future ... will miss u .. always keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Extremely dedicated to wat he does be it academics or events management <img src=Smileys/4.gif />...  he is always trying to give his 110 %...  even in this semester wen everybody else can be seen doing BC all the time... he remains in the lab all the time <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />....  He is a gud singer too ( and also likes to sing a lot, just ask him and he will sing for u <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....  back bone of Aakash house cultural team... He was also the lead of our placement committee and cud be seen running here and there ( on the call of Mr. Jaydev <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ).... but jokes apart he did a lot of work of there even wen he was unplaced... Even at that tremendous pressure he was so cool that shows his ability to handle such high pressure situations <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..... He is gud in sports too... I have seen him playing cricket, BB and volleyball and in all these games he plays with such enthusiasm... that it is pure joy to watch him play ( sometimes he creates some funny situations too specially in VB... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....  yeh kuchh chand logo maine se hai jiski taang bahut khichi jaati hai but he always has smile on his face and is very sporty <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....

But this personality is the captain of all rounders. 9 pointer, researcher, smart, gamer (bhale taash hi sahi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), sketching, actor, sporty, adventurist, good speaker etc. There is hardly any domain where he lacks.<br><br>I still clearly remember introducing himself to Sangal Sir in workspace on the first day of iiit.<br>It was only sambhav whom i can recollect among the 50 stood there. It is quite evident from this incident that Sambhav makes his presence wherever he stands.<br><br>His contribution in felicity was worth appreciating. He has been active in all possible college affairs. he is polite, honest, trustworthy and sometimes diplomatic which is essential at times. <br><br>He joined us for the Sikkim Trip and made it a memorable one.

We have spend lots of time together that if I can keep mentioning everything than probably I will keep on writing <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Anyway I will try to keep it very short <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>	Sambhav ,I first met him in A4 English class.Being in the cellar and same english group we often came across however not that close that time. He used to attend all the english classes , works for his essays and homework <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> (in the first year when you have lots of other tasks as well). Used to finish all the Shalabh sir's assignment at the quickest <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . <b>He is expert in minimum input and maximum output thing</b>. He is very good in designing.Often makes logo,poster etc. to make things presentable even when the essentials(content etc.) are nothing. His work is always polished and neat(altough his room is total mess <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>We bonded mostly in Summer'07. Summer'07 was the time we enjoyed a lot. All of us used to wake up by 5 (pm) , goes to cs, then dinner at Vindu, fir taash ya cricket in BB court, then night out playing CZ, early morning volleyball, then NBH ke saamne baith kar BC and lastly Breakfast at OBH. That was our schedule for month <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.It was real fun . No work, no pressure and lots of masti. That time Often takes us to try different restaurants and usually they sucked <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but fir bhi will miss those days for sure <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> . Even Summer'08 was fun but summer'07 ki toh baat hi kuch aur thi .After Summer'07 I shifted to rum in his diagonal and he always lands up in my room for BC. Used to wake me up for all the classes <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. We often watches movies together. We used to cook maggies in night. <br><br>contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The Semester break when we went "Sikkim" was really incredible. The hotel-hunt that night in darjelling by us, toy train ke 6 ghante gate mein baithna , har jagah momo khana,diwali night mein car mein dance karna <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and all those fantastic places and people like you makes the trip even more memorable <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I think its one of the best Diwali I spend in my life. Coming back from trip we organized together Antakshari in felicty'08. He hosting all the event at 3p.m. in sunny day <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He was also present in post felicity celebration. Maggi that night in kulbir's rum was just awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .When comes to playing cards. I think he make his partner jinxed . Often becomes my partner in "29", and all I get is 1-2 points in most of the game <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . Very lucky when comes to teen patti, often reaches Indira nagar and various places <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>Was my NLP tutor, used to help me with all my assignments and stuff <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.We studied for placements together.The placement studies where we used to pick questions from random sites or sheets and solve them. His recollection of concept is mindblowing . Often remembers ki uss class mein uss prof/tutor ne iss type ka kuch btaya tha and is generally correct(altough kabhie khabar kaat deta hain<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). We (me,sam and bansi) used to sit together for hours trying to read for placement but after few question we always starts our BC or some movie etc.. The maggi and heater hunt that day is memorable. Throughout the placement season, though he was not placed his dedication was superb <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He helped in conducting interviews of other even though he has to prepare for his placements next day. I feel really embarrassing talking you that time but you were all calm and focused <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Was delighted when heard the news <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.I am sure "checktronix" guys have wished for someone extra special and are extra lucky to have you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>As for girls I guess "Jab kismet ho ..... toh kya karega pandu" fits best for him. Bechare ne apni poori school life "boys school" mein guzar di. I still wonder how a guy like him has no admirer <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> . As pointed by Maroo the other day he is really a ladies man. Too soft, handsome, dashing, trendy , expressive and what not. Bit Still not acts frustoo and cries for it. Even when that tragedy with tinki happened , he was calm and all composed <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. I hope someone special is waiting for you (in chennai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) .<br>He seems like all nice and fundoo kind of guy but he often becomes manipulative and evil . Diplomatic is the word rightly coined for him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Always finds a way to come neat and clean from all pangas. Janab ko photo khichane ka vishesh shauk hain, ajeeb-2 pose mein photo hain iski . Has a photogenic personality (aur iski aankhen bhi khuli rehti hain <img src=Smileys/20.gif />) .<br>Wish you all the best for MS and hope Chennai will be not that bad as you think.

He was working day in and out for the placements though he was very tensed for his own placement. <br>Always ready for a trip.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I've used this word earlier for him but my old orkut profile got deleted- this guy's a gem! Padhai-likhai, organizing events, college ke affairs, volleyball, ghumna firna, bc.. He's always there. Rather than 'tinka', I'd call him superman! His dedication is exemplary. His mannerisms are brilliant. A perfect gentleman for the ladies. His wife will be one lucky female. He's always ready to help you out.<br><br>However, this chap rarely opens up. He talks, he laughs, he listens but he does not really speak his feelings out. He is diplomatic sometimes- but generally to good effect- Its generally an avoid confrontation situation- He's like Jai in Jaane tu ya jaane na. Yes, that sweet!<br><br>Lot of memories associated with this chap- Freshers and Carnival, cellar BCs, Graphics. However, my favorite memory with him is undoubtedly on the stage of Felicity '08. As soon as it got over, a lot of us, including me were numb. People came and hugged me. I didn't know how to react. It's when I hugged him that both of us broke down- literally into tears. That moment will remain etched in my memory forever.<br><br><b>Character he represent: Jai in Jaane Tu..<br>Fav memory: Felicity '08 - just when it got over<br>Message for you: Be the way you are dude.
