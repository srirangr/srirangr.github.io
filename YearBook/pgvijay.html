He sacrificed many opputtunities to see that his friends get placed first. kudos to you <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. An active member in Samvedana. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> The thing which I like the most in him is his matured behavior.  At the same time he can be a good and funny friend. <br><br>I wish you get the position you deserve the most.

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first person who appreciated my sleeptimedreams blog and suggested me that<br>I watched Heroes! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We used to talk a lot about sitcoms and other things in general.<br>His blogposts are quite witty and wacky, especially that DC++ one.<br>It was during felicity that we made a common friend, DJ Jude.<br>He says I should marry my laptop, lol !! Don't you love your laptop? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>Then came the 3rd year. We saw Jodha Akbar in his room. We also went out to Spoorthy with Namrata, Spandy and Shrikant. It was an awesome experience. A cut on my finger, my dance, your home (remember FTV incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) etc etc.<br><br>After coming to 4th year, we were in gangsta-gang. The rappers, the rockers gang. We rarely discussed about CAT papers and all, most of the times our discussions were based on movies and TVShows. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The day I shared stage with him as <b>Amar-Prem</b>  during Felicity 09 was the most unforgettable day of my life. He was a bit nervous in the beginning, but he performed better than me in the end and Amar-Prem jodi was awesome!!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Also, this guy has a very big database of songs, and I <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> you for identifying any song, any goddam song, in the first 5 seconds. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>There are many many many more things to cherish,( especially 4th year incidents. We'd a lot of fun this year man!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> ) but because of the time constraint, I might have to end my testimonial here.<br><br>I promise you that apni Amar-Prem ki jodi hamesha hamesha ke liye Amar rahegi aur duniya me prem ka sandesh failati rahegi (bhavnoun ko samjho. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>Apna,<br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>Sorry baap, I thought jinke saath sabse jyada memories associated hain, unko last me likhunga. But sala time khatam ho gaya <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Koi na .. typos ko chod de .. bhavnaoun ko samajh. Here goes my testimonial.<br><br>Prateek chicha, khan bhai, PG are the various nick names I use to call this guy. He's the most ultra/super/extrmely cool guys I've ever seen in my life. According to me the definiton of cool is 'Prateek chicha'. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>A piece of fact. People, I'm not the one who knows the maximum languages or who is exposed to maximum number of different cultures in our college, its Prateek. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <b>This guy knows 5 languages</b>. Dude! Kasa kay? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>In first year, our interactions were limited to the CGPA talks and Orkut account details. This guy was so addicted to orkut that, he used to get almost 150 scraps a day. Also, we prepared a lot for ITWS-2 Regular expressions together + SPIM codes. (Dude, do you even remember all those things that we did in 1st year? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). It was one helluva fun. Wherever this guy is fun followz <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Ok. Coming to 2nd year, our paths became different. He was being tortured in ECE and I enjoyed myslef in CSE. In those days, most of our interactions took place in NBH mess only.<br><br>But after 2nd year, in the summers, we played a lot of cricket and I must say, Prateek is a very good bowler with a perfect idea of line and lenght. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. to be frank, bating li8 mama... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, but again shows kasi on the field. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Also during that time, he was addicted to watching heroes and he always insisted me to watch it, apart from many other shows that we usually watch. But I never watched it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He's an awesome blogger. I'm a big fan of his blogging style. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The guy most guys want to be like <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. At least thats what I infer from all the testimonials that have been written for you <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. It is not a surprise though because he is a thorough gentleman,very good at his academics, a super-integral part of Samvedana - has worked his heart out for it, has a unique <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> sense of humour, is very mature and understanding and the amount of effort he put in during the placements season was incredible. Worked really hard during Felicity as well and I have never seen him lose his cool.I got to know him in the 3rd year and remember him as this Scrubs loving, WWE fan with whom I had numerous fights (on-line of course <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) on facebook wrestler! <br>    Even though you've written "i'm no superman" in your profile, you really are <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Loads of luck for your future and stay the same. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>PS: Dude, expand your colour palate puhleezzz <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In all my four years, I have never had a role-model, just wanted to be what I wanted to. <br><br>But today, I say as I said before. This guy is everything I want to be <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Kudos</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>So here goes, i m finally writing a testimonial for my ex-room partner and my best friend Prateek Gunda Vijay. We both knew each other at around 10th class itself, both of us went to the IIT coaching center known as Sharma, we used to sit in the last bench and do a lot of BC in place of reading. Those days were a lot of fun since he used to be one of psycho srinu favourite students<br><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br> We then met once again during the AIEEE counseling, after meeting him i realized that he was once of the biggest geeks in his corporate jail(Narayana), this guy timings used to be from morning 6 to nite 11 <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif />, a complete opposite to my timings.<br> After comin to IIIT, both of us became room mates, i really have to thank him for bearing me(i used to sleep at 10 which was abnormal in IIIT) <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. During the second year, we use to watch a lot of sitcoms together, he was the person to introduce me to scrubs( He is absolutely crazy about it, u can see that from his profile), we also started playin FIFA at around this time and it was really fun beating him again and again,(but hats off for trying, <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), he could only manage to beat me once.<br> After the 2nd year, this guy went from being normal to hyper. He was the first person in our batch to publish a research paper <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br>and he also did his BTP under VU reddy ( The main reason i think he choose VU was that he wanted to find someone who could play the role of Perry Cox in his life, btw it seems he has found his elliott). Inspite of being in the toughest panel, he aced his BTP. <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br> btw this guy is a big fan of Arsenal a team which never wins and he trys to compare it to chelsea. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He is also one of co-founders of the infamous fight club( the other being me), but this guy doesnt even have the stamina or power to run. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br> Nowadays he is busy with the activities of his  new organization SAMVEDANA, hats off for doing something when most people only take about doing things. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><center><b>"Prateek Ji ki Vijay"<img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b></center><br>Isi shubhakamna ke saath main Prateek ko testimonial likhna shuru karta hun. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Prateek is a very talented, hard-working and a dedicated student. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I've always considered him as a family member.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sometimes I even get upset by his actions <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but still I go to him for peace. I don't know the actual reason, why do I wish to maintain friendship with him. May be the following song is the reason.<br><center><br><i>"Tera mujhse hai pehle ka naata koi ..<br> Yuhin nahin dil lubhata koi ..<br> Jaane tu ya Jaane Naa ..<br> Maane tu ya Maane Naa..<img src=Smileys/4.gif />"</i><br></center><br>He even slapped me once in front of Mahaveer when I did a prank with him. After being slapped, it was me who went to him for peace but he was not ready for truce. Then it was Mahaveer who spoke to him and after that only he came to my room for truce.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> He is the one to whom I have asked maximum no. of times to visit my home in Jaipur but he is still reluctant about that. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> And even on this holi, when I asked him to invite me to his home, he declined.<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I was deeply hurt that day <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> but still I love him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> May be the above song is responsible here as well. I have always wished successes for him. Even at the time of placements, I asked him to allot some work to me in order to alleviate his work load but then also he declined. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> I just wish to give an advice to you, my friend ..<br><center><b>Jis prakar kichad mein puta hua insaan kabhi doosron ko saaf(clean) nahin kar sakta, usi prakar doosre ka bhala karne se pehle tumhe apna khud ka bhala karna padega</b></center><br>Hope you take the advice in positive sense and don't come to slap me.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>The best thing about him is that whatever he brings from home, he distributes all among his friends.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>I pray to God that we always remain in contact since I can't live without my family.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Wish you get the best(est) job and whatever else you anticipate. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I'll always be there for you whenever you remember me. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>CHEERS!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Currently he is working as one of the head for the samvedana group industriously without any self motive. In his guidance, samvedana is able to gather more and more people to work. He even worked a lot for Felicity. He never try to take credit of anything. Inki generosity ke kisse anginat hain lekin likhne ke lie time and words limited hain. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Lekin aisa nahi hai ki sirf kaam hi karta hai saath mein masti bhi chalti rehti hai background mein.

Har kaam dedication ke saath karta hai. Notes bahut acche likhta hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Reports,ppt ye awesome banata hain <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Prateek</u><br><br>Calm, serene, cool, ever smiling, friendly!! if you ask me to define this guy in 5 words these would be the words. A nice company to be around, the guy is always smiling and cheerful. Come what may but you will always find the person cool and calm. He being in my section in first year added to the fact that he lived beside Mux, I started interacting with him quite early in first year and now almost 4 years later I would say that I am glad to have had him as one of my friends in IIIT. If there is anybody who perfectly suits the billing of <b>Gentleman</b>, then it could be none other than him. Have always enjoyed my conversations with him. He has always been a silent worker in the batch, be it Felicity or Placements, he would always be there when you needed him and yet he would almost always go unnoticed and uncredited coz of the silent manner in which he would go about doing his work, surely an example to emulate.<br><br>Though he is in ECE, but have always felt as if he were in CSE, at times while couting the EC people, he is comfortably forgotten with everyone considering him as a CS guy coz of the interaction we all have had with him.<br><br>Have always been a huge fan of his writing, without any doubt consider him to be the best blogger in IIIT. Its always so much fun reading his blog posts, unfortunately the posts are a rare happening but each and every post of him has the power to make your day.<br><br>All the best for your future<br><b>An Advice: Blog, blog and blog man... Keep writing</b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

I wish you a great future ahead raa..Just saw you and your team Samvedana on "Eenaadu" weekly today.

<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Prateek is one of the gentlemen of our batch. He is always calm. Bahut kam bolta hai, lekin kaam ki baat hi bolta hai. Haan kabhi-kabhaar BC bhi kar leta hai. <br><br>He is very hard working and that became evident to everyone when he worked for placements of the batch and for Felicity '08. The best thing is he keeps doing his work silently and does not ask for any credit in return <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <br><br>Isko photography ka kaafi shauk hai. Sabki pics leta rahta hai lekin apni pics nahin lene deta <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>The initiative of Samvedana taken by him is really wonderful and he is working really hard for it. Kabhi party ke liye jaana ho ya ghoomne jaana ho to pata chalta hai ki Prateek nahin jayega kyonki use Samvedana ki meeting attend karni hoti hai. But I really respect you for the work you are doing <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Dussehra at your home was the best celebration of a festival I had at hyderabad <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and hope you succeed in everything you do.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Heya!<br><br>Hmm Gunda vijay as i call him is the mr cool guy of our batch. I have rarely seen him getting frustrated. The only times he was a bit tense was during felicity organization and all i guess. He is very composed during discussions and wingchats. I totally loved organizing RJing with him for the Sunday Carnival in the third year. <br><br>He has been good at acads too. He and his past roomie AK are like exact opposites. Your fight club initiative was very interesting i wanna be a part of it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  Finally its good to see he is contributing more to the college through Samvedana.<br><br>He has been a great asset to the batch also. Ak has also agreed so i think this time during batchtrip we can have fight club finally <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Prateek is a very humble person. His work in Samvedna is commendable. He is the person, from which sometimes I take inspiration. So much social work he does when he himself is not very sure about his future is really inspirational. He always seems so composed in every situation. He has so many friends thanks for his multi-lingual skills. He fits almost everywhere. <br>He is good at studies. Prateek, did you tell everyone that how impress RAMU IS with you and Mr. Sharma <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He is the creative guy of our group and he is using it in a good way.<br>All the best for your future. I will always be your friend.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>It all started with an English Class in the first semester, a beautiful young thing entered the classroom accompanied with a celestial breeze, his pupil expanded, following a sudden rush of blood. The next thing he heard was: "I'll be your English Teacher for this semester". What followed was a total blur - a hazy chain of events. Whatever she wore, she was just smokin'. She was better than Mary Jane and Heroin put together. Prateek just swayed through the mists of time. Time just flew by. Suddenly, she disappeared from his busy life. Damn!*<br><br>[CUT TO: SECOND SEMESTER]<br><br>Then followed the phenomenon of The Great Blues, Prateek started feeling blue, wearing Blue tees, watching films of the blue sorts and ultimately was introduced to STRIPPERS(+) of the blue-ish version.<br><br>a) He had a stripper on his lap for 15 min<br>b) He started wearing a tee with a message - "I've been with a stripper"<br>c) His pickup line became - "Doesn't it feel Electric, babe?"<br>d) He started using NOKIA 36-24-36<br><br>He tried the entire book of Calvin & Hobbes, infy documentaries on the LAN, GBs of Megan and finally his roomie came to the rescue, AK did something miraculous and comforted him (of which I've no freakin' clue) He recovered. Ready to take on the world. Rest is history! a well documented one I suppose. He bought the Monk's Ferrari, went for long drives, participated in street races, broke some traffic rules, made records, won peoples hearts and is presently, giving that machine a little rest, servicing it for the road ahead. Bon Voyage, my friend.     <br><br><br>+ FACT: 'Stripper' is a cutting instrument which ECE people use in their daily humdrum.<br><br>* Even now, if she calls me (I mean, hypothetically, I know it's Never Gonna Happen but still <umeed pe sari duniya kaayam hai yaar>...) in the middle of the night and says she wants to...you know. My answer would be only one thing: "I'm BORN ready!". I wear Blue Shoes for her, even today. Sigh.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

The night we all went for Sharat+Sashi's birthday treat which was followed by a mindblowing photo-session of Tifozi and Sashi, the gazal (or was it shayari?) night, where I blowed your mind off with all the stupid phattas possible on planet E and not to forget your birthday celebration and the aftermath <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> - Sweetest memories to remember, aren't they?<br><br>	Put your hands together ladies and gentlemen for this guy - one of my closest friends, a co-founder of Samvedana, a person whose immense support and indelible efforts has helped Samvedana reach where it is now ,a perfect gangsta, a mind so surpassingly creative and a heart so exceedingly sweet, that you can only wonder - what does it take to be someone like him, to whom everybody looks up to and takes notice? So admirable and yet so humble, so winsome and yet so simple, what does it take to be somebody like him?? Honestly, I have no answer..<br><br>	Wishing you truck loads of good luck and happiness throughout <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>"I have no worries about me, its about others that I am worried"..If you hear someone saying this, well..it can only be one person.. Ladies and gentlemen, this guy needs no introduction. He is the first guy in our batch to have a research paper on his name. He is ardently in love with the first love of his life - Electronics - something from which I swore to remain atleast 10 feet away <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Okay, thats just one of the many sides of him.. He was one of the prominent pillars who helped Felicity'08, 'OUR' felicity, to reach to the level it has risen and set a reference standard for the forthcoming batches to follow . He has selflessly shelled out a lot more than his share of time and energy to see that his friends get placed, not once, not for one single time being selfish about his own benefit.<br><br>	Have you ever met somebody, meeting whom, you wished you possessed atleast a minute fraction of that person's good will, you, astounded by his humbleness and selflessness and dedication and wittiness, cannot but pray the best for him.<br><br>              I, known in my own little humble world for being an expert in pulling others' legs, have failed to pick one, I repeat, "ONE" aspect in him so that I can pull his leg on that. Can you 'be' any more nice? But hey, who says I have given up? I am on it! <br><br>	A vegan, foxed by Megan (hey, that rhymes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) a big fan of F1, WWE, gaming, movies, F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Scrubs, Shrubs, grubs, drubs, what not! Loves grey, infact his color palette starts with grey and ends with black. I have never really known him in the first three years of our stay here in IIIT, except for, ofcourse, through blogging.. Oh yes, I am one big fan of his blog, which I wish is revived sometime pretty soon. Its through Sharat and Sashi that we got together and started hanging out.. Then Samvedana happened and when we started working together as a team that I got to know him better. <br>	</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=yogendra.html>Yogendra Umesh Itankar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Prateek is the person who truly understands the meaning of living together as a <b>family</b>. Be it the ECE family or IIIT family. He has done a lot for felicity. Being a part of the small ECE group, I feel and admire the sacrifice you have made for our batch. <br><br>When the placement representative for ECE was to be chosen, none of us(including me) was coming forward. Each one was busy in his own work. Initially Prateek was a bit reluctant, but when he saw the pathetic condition of our group, his sense of family arose and he took the responsibility. Hats off to you man! I can never forget this incident in my life. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He was my wing partner in first two years and had a good time together. Whatever little telugu i know is because of him.<br><br>I can very clearly remember when we were to choose ece placement lead, my first choice was prateek. Initially he refused to work for Committee as he had other commitments like CAT and I admire that after he joined the committee he worked selflessly.<br><br>His dedication towards placements had motivated all of us in the team. Ofcourse Adi, randeep and Sambhav too. He is a true soul of honesty, truth and trust. It was pleasure working with him for last 8 months in placements. <br><br>His contribution in felicity was also worth noticing. I have seen him working hard to road to success of felicity'09. <br><br>Onething which really inspires me is his 'no compromise' nature. He had options to opt for teaching or switching to cse jobs but he was determined to get a job of his choice and not the choice by circumstances.<br><br>I bow you for all the things mentioned above.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>A lot of what I wanted to write about Prateek has already been written. Ideal. Super cool, even under pressure. Amicable, with everyone. In the initial days, it was people like him who were the bridge in the so-called 'north-south divide'. Guys like him were so important for the unity of the batch, and he's been one who's worked tirelessly towards it. And its to his credit that I can proudly say that UG2K5 is the batch with an unprecedented amount of harmony and conviviality within the batch. I mean, there is so much positive energy, that one doesn't have to bother about politics and shit when he/she goes out to do something good.<br><br>I remember him as this silent chap during the first couple of years, but he was a very important cog in the Felicity wheel. In the initial few days, I remember that it was he who tried to bring peace. He was the one who brought Prudhvi and me, and urged us to work together. Later, he was there in every department of Felicity, giving suggestions, running for deals, designing tees, getting DJs, campaigning in colleges, pushing people to work. In each of these aspects, he generally remained cool (I saw him lose it just once.. During the tee shirt thingy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) and tried to reason out with people when required. I was very impressed by his demeanour, cool and gentlemanly behaviour. Besides, he has always been sincere about giving back to the society, which can be seen by the brilliant work for Samvedana, and the work during Felicity.<br><br>All in all, an amazing chap who's very difficult to forget. May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Kimi Raikonnen.<br>Fav memory: Arguing about Felicity tees.<br>Message for him: You should be a little more assertive.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 3:<br><br><b>There's no guy </b>in the batch about which something lesser or the other cannot be said.

You restore my faith in humanity, and you're one of the (several) people in the batch I'll look out for. <br><br><b>If all this </b>might be a bit too much for you, then I'd exhort you to rise up to it. If by chance there's something about Prateek that I'm missing, that Prateek is not the guy I've described here, I'm sure nobody has it in him more than Prateek to become the guy I've described. <br><br>Peace. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2:<br><br><b>This guy's a</b> Maryada Purushottam Ram. If not the whole distance, then atleast a long way along that direction. Think, what's an ideal guy supposed to do? What are his responsibilities? The first responsibility is for himself and his chosen work. Prateek's a fodu, even by ECE standards. He himself told me in so many words that he's been a sincere student since his +1. Taken courses, BTP under all BOND profs. And not just that, he's so dedicated to his field that he'll take up a job/ study further only in that stream, and not compromise on this aspect. Hat's off to this dedication, bro <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Second responsibility, I believe, is towards the community. In this, he goes way beyond fulfilling it. His work during Felicity was exceptional. And that during Placements is multidimensioanal, and in a different league. And with the Placement season hardly over, he has taken the initiative of Samvedana and has set standards for others to follow. <br><br>Bit and pieces? He's funny. He wrote the best blog posts. A good conversationist. Charming to the ladies. And... Hell! Need there be anything more?<br><br><b>How does he </b>handle all this? From where does come the life force, as well as the moral force to do all this? I think it's the way you do things. A teetotaller and a thorough gentleman, I've never seen him utter a single foul word all these months. Have never seen him bitch about anyone. Have seen him defend his friend when someone made an (apparently) serious allegation. Have never even seen him shout at anyone. Have never seen him trying to grab credit for anything he's done. All this, and still being tolerant and not passing judgement on others' bad! Even if I were to be the most cynical person on earth, I'd still say that all this cannot be made up. One cannot pretend for so long. <i>(contd.)</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1:<br><br><b>All I can say </b>about Prateek is that he's the most ideal guy I've ever seen. I admit I haven't seen as much of him as I've seen of others or as others have seen of him, but not all things in life need the brute-force method. <br><br><b>I don't really rmr</b> anything about him from the initial part of our BTech. That was because we had different hostels, different sections, different streams, different interests (like football, sports, common house activities etc), and well, we had also come from different regions (a factor which looks rather trivial now, but one which unfortunately plays such a huge factor in the initial years). I remember him sending me an Orkut friend request and me asking Narang who Prateek Gundanavar was!<br><br>From the third year, I remember him working his ass off for Felicity. He had become an active and responsible member of the batch affairs. I remember our interaction during, and immediately after (<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) Felicity. But I remember clearly that by the end of the third year, I still had no clue about him as a person. It was Placecom nominations, and people were crying "Prateek from ECE" and I was like, "Hmm, this guy worked well for Felicity, so why not." That was just about it.<br><br><b>Come final year,</b> and our interaction grew. It was the combined effect of the meals we had together in Yuktahaar, him working his ass off yet again for the placements, the actual placement season, studying for an exam together in the lib (<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and finally Samvedana. I still repeat that all that still isn't very voluminous, but again, you don't need to stare at a diamond for years to tell that it's a diamond. <i>(contd.)</i><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
