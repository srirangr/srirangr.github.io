More than that, I have a respect for your athletic abilities. You were the first woman Sports Captain in IIIT. You thoroughly deserved that position. It was an honor to compete with you. I would always, always have respected whatever you might have said at that time, even if it were against our house.<br><br>All the best for life. I'm sure you'll do great.<br><br><b>Memories:</b> Our first interaction, during play practice, in which you refused to give me Deepti and Namrata's phone nos.

"Bharat as a volunteer u are close to amazon people na... Plz recomend my name" <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. This happened in the morning and by evening she got placed <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.

<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I thought I will be the first one to write testimonial for you before you write to me. But you know competing with you is very tuff. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>prashasti is the name which is a near synonym to perfection. I feel it so. be it in academics, sports, or cultural etc.<br><br>I used to see her in reading room most of the times. I am just a visitor but she lives there I guess <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Here went our first interaction where she asked me to keep a watch on her lappy.<br><br>She is the girl who everyone in the class expects big things for her. Everyone has high expectations for her. OMG she is the topper of DBMS I guess where I hardly managed to get marks. Take these <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>The next interaction of her is during placements. She is very kind in helping others. I used to wonder how is she so energetic who always have everlasting enthu (she is very lean <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but always active). She was very helpful to everyone during placements. Even though I don't know her much, she used to offer me snacks too during placements <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and used to talk very friendly.<br><br>An allrounder. I wonder if I can play that many games and be as good as her. Abhilash ka competitor. I was expecting allrounder award for abhilash or you. <br><br>All the best. I am sure that the place which haves you is lucky. IIIT miss you.<br><br>bye <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Prashasti is one of the most intelligent people in our batch - I place her amongst the likes of Manish, Somani and Saraswat.  Moreover, she is a sweet and simple girl who is going to reach great heights in her life. <br><br>I remember the first time I met her in the first sem. While walking towards our hostels after the workspace had closed, Chand introduced me to her and Shikha while going for a coffee. She was one of those simple girl next door stereotypes. However, with the course of time, she has made great stride in her outward personality and has become more suave. It reflects from her talking and dressing ways - from plain salwar suits to urbane shirts and jeans. Although we never became great friends, I have a lot of respect and admiration for her. I can now admit that I also had a slight crush on her during the initial weeks of the 3rd sem <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Some memorable incidents - Once playing Truth and Dare at CS, I was given a task to propose her. Gawd, I fared miserably at that.  <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> However the memory of this hilarious incident still manages to make me laugh. Then comes my first year bday treat to her - we could get nothing but a pack of Goodday at the coffee shop <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>Coming to Placements, I remember the first day well - Microsoft interviews - she was one of the top contenders of getting through the day 1 company and I was quite hopeful.  However, it turned outta be a disappointing day for both of us - no one got through. But fate had something else in store for her. She got placed the next day itself. I got a party as well - this time it wasn't a pack of Goodday but a handsome treat at Pizza Hut<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> After getting placed, she helped me with the placement process on numerous occasions. <br>Keep in touch! <br><br>All the best for your career!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I know this testimonial comes as a surprise to all. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Anyway, this is dedicated to the awesome time we spent together. I still remember those times - we used to follow the "exact" same schedule - slept at same times, went for P.T.(and 'bunked' it) on the same days, went to lab together, came back together, had *every* meal together, of course went for movies and other outings together.... phew! I remember one day she had gone to her local relatives and Prachi asked me shocked "Where is your other half?" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Cheers to those times!!<br><br>I don't exactly remember how and when it started, but we drifted (wide) apart over the years. Nevertheless, I think we both know that we both miss those days -- the first sem days -- the group of famous four.<br><br>I'll try to enumerate what all I remember from the stay with her. She is a very caring person. She is a person who can maintain her calm and patience in almost any situation, will not react immediately even if she's hurt or sad, will try to listen your side of story, and is quite understanding... But yes don't take her for being fragile, she can 'kick' you (literally) if needed be !!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It goes without mentioning that she is very sincere and dedicated to her work (I know - sab ko pata hai !!).<br><br>Baaki ... she hates it when you say "aur kitna khayegi!!" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I used to scold her for wasting food (hope you don't do it now!!). <br><br>I always missed the those lovely times, the outings we went to, the night outs, the movies in labs, the girly-talks, .... and I always will miss them.<br><br>And yes .. the fattas we together used to crack!<br>Period.<br><br>All the best girl! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She was in my discussion group, this is where I first met her. First impressions were that she was a <i>mahila mandal</i> activist, <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... lol just kidding ... I thought that she was a well mannered <i>"acchi bacchi"</i>types ... she used to speak/debate very nicely at that time . Then we met in Freshers preparation of Vayu house. We had a "nach baliye" group number. Mera to pata nahin, she danced quite well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . At that time I was very shy, I felt quite embarrassed to practice the "draupadi entrace" act in the play in front of her and Navatha <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... Kudos to you for winning so many medals for vayu <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <br><br>We were part of the same friends circle and had lots of group studying, BC'ing, walks etc. etc. One thing was quite evident that she used to strive for excellence in acads and also try to have fun at the same time. <br><br>Innumerable Achievements <i>aur </i> Sports <i>ke baarein mein aur kya hi bolun</i> baaki sab ne bol hi diya hai ... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Final impressions are that she is fun-loving person, hardworking and dedicated to her priorities in life . And yes were easy to irritate <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .  Bengaluru mein maze karenge <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>All in all, she is a wonderful person and good at heart.<br><br>Best of luck with your future endeavors. <br><br>May god bless ! </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>lets rewind.. 1st year... the reason I never really talked to her back then was  .. I've always had this feeling that she would cry the moment I say something <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. still don't know why it was so <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... I mean I've never been careful with my words with gals, and looking at fragile, lanky looks I didn't want to burden her anymore <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>But still we did talk on certain occasions <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>there was this time when shikha came to NBH to examine my new lappy.. and prashasti accompanied her.. I've always felt uneasy in her presence.. but I think I made a truce that day by offering chocos to her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>right through the 1st, 2nd years... whenever we have confronted each other..

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Prashasti - Whenever this name comes to my mind, the words which come along with it are very intelligent, very sharp and extremely good natured. I have a lot of respect for her and for her sheer brilliance. Never interacted with her that much until fourth year came. Initially Chand used to tell me how much sharp she is. He told me when she hadn't prepared for OS till late night when we had that exam next day and then, got the highest marks in that exam. She is a good sportsperson as well as many other people must have mentioned in her testimonials. I have heard from Chand and Vipul that even if she wouldn't study a subject at all, she'll manage an A or A- in that. Then in fourth year when she asked me to teach OS, I was like "main ise kya hi padhaunga yaar, ise to sab aata hi hoga". In a matter of nearly 2 hours, she understood all of the chapters. I didn't need to explain any concept twice. But this time, it was like she might knew most of the things before, that's why. But when I taught her economics when she didn't have any background at all in that subject, she grasped it in a matter of few minutes. I was full of praise for her deep inside. By now, I completely agree with Chand that she is extremely sharp, brainy and intelligent and definitely, has the potential of achieving big in life. All the best for all your future endeavours.

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part I<br><br>Meri pyari Prashu<br>Its really difficult to write a testimonial which can match four orkut testimonials and a big testimonial in the yearbook. Chalo shuru kartein hain... I still remember our first interaction, it was during the Freshers second round, When a girl in blue suit came to me and gave me a compliment on my performance. It was a beginning of an eternal friendship <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. It did not take much time for us to know each other. We spent some quality time doing BC in the first sem. It was<br>then when she had her first night out in the college. First sem we were friends who enjoyed each others company but were not very close. The whole of first sem went in making fun of each other, doing all kiddish stuffs. I still remember the visit to Shilparamam when I accidentally pushed Chuchu off the swing and then series of BC sessions we had over it. The whole "Thumpa" incident. In the first year Prashu, was sidha sadha bachcha types. I still remember making fun of the "village" she came from <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. She stressed on words when she spoke. Started most of her sentences with "Basically blah blah blah". She never studied but managed to get marks. I remember, the number of Milkybar Choo we ate just after the lunch. First sem was all "Happy" types. Then when the first year ended and she was leaving the college she was almost in tears and I was totally numb, it was this period when we realised that we have become really close friends.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>She is been a true friend. Whenever she found me sad , she would run behind me , constantly pester me for like three four hours , asking what happened and dig till I let myself out. I still remember when like after four five hours of long walk I told her what the matter was. I have improved on this, now I don't make her go through this pain stricken process. I have shared almost every bit of my life with her and still she feels then I hide things from her. She is damn possessive about her friends. We both had awesome fun in the Vizag trip. I forgot I always used to help her cross the road , but abhi bachchi badi ho gayi hai. One day, she asked me that no one has ever proposed her, so like a true friend I proposed her <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> though she ditched me later <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part III<br><br>I have already said this, she hardly studies, I remember we had our OS endsems and I was well prepared (That was the time jab main endsems phodta tha!), she called me at 1 am and was totally nervous, she had not prepared for the exam and was not feeling like studying. We went for a walk and I was giving her a brief introduction of chapters, next morning Ma'am studied and got highest in endsems. Its like some people have to get an A in every subject. She has mastered the way of writing the exams. She has been the sportswoman of IIIT-H.  I have always been in the crowd cheering her to win. I still remember how upset she was when she lost in 100m, though one Munnabhai style hug did cheer her up. She doesn't like to lose. I have seen her getting irritated even when she scored less in any paper.<br>Situations changed a bit after second year, but we were same old friends. After second year we did not meet regularly like before but apart from this nothing changed. Whenever we met we started from the day we left our conversation. Yes, at times we throw tantrums at each other,she claiming that I am always busy with Parliament and me claiming that she has other people to mamange <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We have had BC on every possible topic. This lady has a very strong pair of legs. If you make fun of her, try to pull her leg<br>then your going to get it really hard. Prashu is a very understanding and caring friend and its because of this that many people see a very good friend in her. She is a patient listener and shows maturity when thinking about others problem. She has been an ear to many sad souls, but interestingly she is always in dilemma about her own life, from the first year I have been predicting things about her. Prashu can never keep her anger for long, she carries a dead face when she is angry. Its easy to cheer her up when she is in a bad mood, an orange candy or a chaat will do. She loves bikes. Whenever she is sad or upset we go for long bike rides. Prashu, worked a lot for Felicity'08. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part IV<br>We have had endless fun, from watching movies to eating out, long walks ... this list is endless.<br>he is very stable and very determined. I still remember her getting shorlisted for Google Woman<br>award and her reaction when she did not win it. She is damn good in giving advices. She has<br>helped me out in "n" number of occasions. She likes to dance and I feel guilty for never encouraging her to dance. But, we never miss an oppurtunity to dance together during DJ nights.<br>She is damn caring, she has given me some of the best gifts on my Birthday and all hand made. I took her pen which she considered as a lucky charm. I still remember, I forgot her Birthday and the scolding I got after that. She is pretty intelligent, was the first one to be placed in the batch and she did not leave for home till all her good friends got placed. Prashu has become almost a part of our group, many times it happens we forget that we have a lady besides us and get into or normal vulgar BC sessions.Prashu has very different qualities unlike many girls, she is very self dependent, I have hardly seen her breaking down even in very distressing situations, most of the times she is calm<br>and composed. Right from the first year she has always been there for me.<br><br>Some Mermories- our endless discussions on random topics, the whole of second year, all your<br>sports events, you lifting the sports-woman cup(and carrying the torch the next year), all<br>the night outs, bike rides, movies we watched together, DJ nights, Vizag trip, all the BC on<br>your future life, always cursing you for ditching me, all my funda sessions on things you need to improve, your tantrums. Anyways we both are placed in the same city so will not have this feeling of missing her after the college. The amount of help and support she has given me is unparalled and "I owe a lot to you lady!"<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[Part 1]<br><u>Prashasti aka Sukdi</u><br><br>My interactions with girls@iiit have been rather sporadic and limited, save for this girl who has been one of my closest friend in IIIT. I dont exactly remember when and how we started talking must have been some time towards the end of first sem, coz I discreetly remember hating her in the beginning few months of first sem and then I remember being taught EC by her in 2nd sem. Waise who cares about the when and how it happened, but I sure am glad that it happened. She is one person whose friendship I will always cherish throughout my life.<br><br>Hailing from a small town in Chattisgarh, this girl has taken by world by  storm. Nobody else could satisfy the billing of <b>Over Achiever</b> then it would be her. She hasnt left any field unconquered, everywhere you can see the jhande <b>gadhofied</b> by her, be it becoming Sports Woman of IIIT, being shortlisted for Google Women Engineers, Being the highest placed person in batch. She has always been a person who everybody can look up to and draw inspiration.<br><br>I will also remember the countless times she taught me subjects ranging from EC, OS to DB, I am greatly indebted to her for my grades in quite a few of these subjects. I would surely have flunked in one or the other of these subjects had she not been there to teach me, and ofcourse the combined study we did for Industry & Society course back in our 3rd sem, when all of us were frustrated after reading all those boring terms and all, that was quite an experience. I still have the pics of that fateful night and get nostalgic everytime I look at those pics.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br>She is the first girl in the campus who I would turn up to, if and when I need an advice when the issue is girls in my life. She has been quite a help to me in all such times of distress, advicing me to the best of her knowledge and experience. Its been so much fun interacting with her over these years. She has been the patient listener to all my stories, disappointments, moments of distress. Since the time I came to IIIT, I had plenty of good friends but one thing which was sorely missing in my life@iiit was a (girl) friend and she has fulfilled that role very well. I am indebted to her for being such a good friend through all these years. At times I used to ping her when disappointed/frustrated with something or the other and wanted to talk to her, but the real trouble in such situations used to be that I generally found it very difficult to speak out what I felt. But this girl would keep cajoling me for hours until I came up with the story. I can understand how frustrating it must have been for her, waiting for the freaking guy to open up, she had to bear the frustration with a smile and gotta say she always did wonderfully and was again ready with loads of patience the next time, I was there with something to tell her. I will always remember the <b>Stars</b> wala conversation I had with her. I never could have thought that this kid could be so mature and philosophical. She is one of the very few people who know a particular secret of mine.<br><br>I am also gald to be one of the people with whom she has shared her thoughts and feelings. At times when disturbed she would ping me and we would have our little tete-a-tete. I will always remember the one chat when she was all frustrated and she used a <b>forbidden</b> word and then commanded me to never divulge this piece of information to anybody, and ofcourse the time when after writing a testimonial for somebody, she said something about that person (sorry can't  divulge the details), gotta say felt so good that I know this girl <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Its kinda difficult to write a testimonial for Prashasti because she possess so many different attributes to her personality that it sometimes becomes really hard to understand her. Every time I feel I know her well, she brings out yet another attribute and proves me wrong and I feel many people who know her will agree upon this. I don't have a sister of my own so I was always jealous of people who have one. So I wanted one desperately and what could be a better choice than Prashu who is so caring and sensitive. I never talked to her in first two years but still every time I looked at her, I always thought I should have a sister like her and finally in 3rd year it happened. She is very understanding, strong and and a very good sports person.<br><br>In 5th sem, some of us decided to watch Harry Potter 5 in IMAX and she was also interested in coming with us. But I didn't want her to come and so I said "if she will come, I won't go" and finally she didn't. The reason behind this was that I didn't know her and didn't use to talk to her then and so I always felt very awkward in her company. When I faced her later, that was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I realized that it was very bad on my part and I even said sorry to her and she instantly forgave me. I respect that a lot because I know if some person would have said something like that for me than probably  I would have never forgiven him/her. I deeply regret from my heart for that stupid behaviour of mine. After that everything changed between us and now she is my sister, one of my best friend. I love the way she handles her problems and I always look upon her when in trouble for a solution. She is really strong inside and I can see, she is getting more strong day by day. <br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>On my last b'day, she and PK brought a pizza cake for me (it was simple pizza. I named it cake because she asked me to take a slice and eat it thinking it a cake). That was a unique way to celebrate a b'day. She also presented me a gift which was the best gift I ever had. It was very special because she made it by herself (though PK claims he also helped <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, not sure about that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). Thanx a lot for making that b'day so special.<br><br>An excellent sports person. Exceptionally good in academics. Don't know if its luck or she is that intelligent <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, I feel even if she would leave her exam script empty, I'm sure she will manage to get a B in the subject. She got placed on the first day of placements and that too in Amazon with highest package in our batch. By all of what I have seen so far, nothing wrong has happened with her <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, except one and I pray nothing to happen in future. For that exception also, I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope it will also turn into something good for her. <br><br>What I love the most about her is her decency and sincerity. She will never do anything which will offend her family. She can find happiness in very small things and that's what make her so special and simple. You meet her once and for sure you can't forget her for long. Very sincere and dedicated. She is very possessive about her family and friends. She is very adjusting and can cope up with diverse situations. Always boasts that she own a driving license (though she didn't passed the test for it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and knows how to drive a bike. Gets angry very quickly and its really hard to make her smile when she is upset. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>She is a perfect combination of beauty with brain.

Though I personally don't want you to go to Bangalore, but I still pray you get it.<br><br>My <b>most memorable moment</b> with her would be my last b'day night and a gtalk chat in 5th sem.<br><br>Good Luck.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sukdi sukdi sukdi sukdi sukdi<br><br>Ah... That feels much better <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I'll always remember Prashasti from first year. Secluded, shy, a kiddo and yet silently confident. No doubting the fact that she's changed a lot over time. She is a person who does not makes friends by the dozens- but when she makes them, she sticks around and expects the same from them. Very few people are close to her, but those who are- extremely protective about her. Says a lot about her, doesn't it? After that, she's immersed in her own little sweet world <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Whether she is ambitious or not- I don't know. But I know that she can easily achieve whatever she wants to- She is supremely intelligent. Besides, she applies her intelligence to what she does. Ahh.. and athletics- she's the best of them all! <br><br>I'll always remember the work she put in for Felicity '08. Brilliant, selfless work in the hospitality and campaigning department.. She along with Srujan, Aniket, Rohit and others. She's always spoken about the batch and its unity, a strong advocate for the same. I'll also remember first year, and the skirmishes we had <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>All the best in life buddy, May God bless!<br><br><b>Person she resembles: Maybe Shobana Bhartia or Shikha Sharma<br>Fav memory: The walks with her in first year<br>Message for her: As a toad in the water, look beyond your well.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
