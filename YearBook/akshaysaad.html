<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Saad is the quintessential engineer-student gamer. He has such amazing passion for gaming, something which betrays his demeanour. He is not that aggressive foul-mouthed chap, if anything hes right on the other pole. Soft spoken and well mannered, he always asks good things about you when you meet. He has got very good knowledge in a lot of spheres, especially economics and technology, where he is fodu. I guess hes well suited to do an MBA or CFA, I'm sure he'll make it to one of the top B-schools.<br><br>It was quite surprising that he could not get placed earlier, especially given his level of competence. However, to his credit, he kept going and did not give up. The results had to show, and show they did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I really hope he enjoys his job, and has a great life ahead!<br><br><b> Fav memory: Discussing economics </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Probably the only guy from IIIT-H to have covered each and every god damn english serial in DC <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I owe him a lot for giving me those precious <b>House</b> dvd's when i had lost total hope of watching the previous season.<br><br>He has a unique style of walking. Kabhi hamare saath bhi CS khel liya karo lambu bhai. All the best rock in Pega.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I sometime call him Saabu (comic character) because he walks like him. His dedication for playing games is something you can easily get inspired from. He is the best in Counter Strike among friends. Kamina sala apne partners ko maar kar phir sare enemies bhi maar deta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is always nice to you irrespective of the mood. You rarely see a combination of decency and such a huge body structure. Logon ki lene mein bhi maahir hai. Coffee shop par dude ra ki leta hai to koi kuchh nahin bol pata <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first interacted with him in 3rd year during graphics assignment and i must admit that he is one of the most lazy and wierd guys i've ever met. He is simple, very moody at times (he suffers a lot due to this) and can be irritating also<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, but overall he's a great guy. Has a lot of interest in Computer Gaming and Reading good Books (me too<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).<br>         He was my BTP project partner (We both were about to take individual projects under Beza, when by coincidence we met outside Beza's office and thought of doing the project together. Well it really helped us bcoz the project got completed and we both dint came to know till the end, who among us actually did the project???<img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>         Well i'm sure you'll do well in your Life and I wish you Best Of Luck for everything<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Three things I am reminded of when I see his face:<br>1. CS/CZ/AOE<br>2. Sitcoms<br>3. Pizza<br>I don't remember the first time we met but I do remember him staying in our (my and Atul's) room in GHEB for short break between classes (he stayed on 3rd floor). He introduced me to AOE and CZ. He introduced Atul to Tekken (I already knew about Tekken) and we played tekken at night a lot during second year. AOE we played from night till morning, had breakfast, then continued our game till lunch, had lunch... till everyone got bored, went to their rooms and slept, only to start the next day in same way. Had it not been for him, I<br>would not have had those lovely memories of playing computer games on LAN.<br>We do share liking of Sitcoms and pizzas. It is with him that I have had almost all my pizzas in hostel life. Now a days he doesn't greet me with "hi" or "hello", but with "pizza". "toh aaj kitne pizzas khaane hain" is what he starts his conversation with me.<br>His room is one of the neatest rooms I've been to. It gives a sense of freshness, perhaps that's the reason his thinking is so clear and precise.<br>He is one of the sharpest minds I've met in our batch and his strategy making and game playing skills are quite good. Best part is that he is someone who can never irritate me, however hard he tries, although he does behave childishly sometimes!<br>Its fun discussing movie facts with him, and we exchange suggestions on what new can be watched. The scuffling and pushing between him and Maglu, in my wing were quite amusing to watch. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his cool headed attitude and sharp mind, and what I would never take from him is his cool headed attitude and sharp mind! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (it does make sense, it does. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Saad - I call him "sadhu" ... this was one guy i remember who used to play computer games a lot... especially mortal combat .. all d time .. i used to wonder how can someone play only one game 24 X 7 ... a very simple person .. at the same time very funny ... the most admirable quality of this person is "simplicity" .. keep rocking dude ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Saad,Jojo,new_to_game a core gamer of our batch. Always ready to play any game at any time. He is the BEST in AOE at present and CZ mein bhi top 3 mein toh hoga hi <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Always plays role of underdog in winning team, as in isne kuch hi nahin hua ho, sab apne aap haar gye ho <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/3.gif />. At first I used to think him a studious kinda guy but my perception changed completely during those CZ and AOE games in Summer. He is the one who have watched most of the Sitcoms. Big fan of HOUSE. I think he is among the few who started watching sitcom right from 1st year and still continue to do so.<br>He has carefree attitude. If he decides not to do an assignment, he not even bother to copy that from someone else.Very good in Visual basic and stuff. We have same mentor for ITWS project and as he is MATKA, we used to have ball while presenting our project. Has a very creepy smile, always his smile is enough to tell u something is cooking or someone has done some nuisance.<br><br>During placement season also, he was not at all tensed and continue to do things normal way.I hope you do great in Pegasystem and continue playing games with juniors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All the best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and keep in touch  <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- CZ, AOE<br>Most Memorable moments : - CZ in 4-2, AOE in 4-1, Ohris jiva treat <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Msg for U: - Be the Same<br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hamari shuruwat hui AGE se and end bhi shayad AGE se ho ga... lekin is AGE to AGE ki journey mai we have traversed so far off the road and explored each other a lot. He is one of the finest gamers of our batch. And above that even if I lose all the games against him i would still love to play more and more with him. There was a time when we together as a team never lost against atul's team for a year. But now Atul too has improved a lot, fir bhi thoda halka padta hai mere aage <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>One thing which I would always remember is his cunning smile with which he would tease the opponent even after winning continuously for 10 matches. The opponent gets frustrated and gives up eg Mks.<br><br>He is all time ready for Dominos, AGE and outing. One will always enjoy his company. One thing I never like about him is his carelessness towards placements. I kep motivating him to study for placements but he never bothered so. But finally he is placed with a decent package and that too in Hyd. Count++. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Contd.<br>I think you have a lot of potential and will do something great in future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .....<br>Will always remember the talks with you abt Friends, House, AOE .....   and other things... ; The summer project which we did together ( which never got completed though your ideas were awesome ), The way you answered Uday Kiran in Esagu lab.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Your name from me...

<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If you see this guy for the first time you will think that is a very secretive guy who doesn't like to talk much, remains in his room all the time, and is very studious.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> but as you come to know him a little better you will find that he is an extreme opposite of what I just said... <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I got to know him better when he used to play Tekken in atul's room and later when he and I were the only one left in GHEB....  We both share an extreme love for Friends and other TV series as well....   He also introduced AOE to me and as you can ask anybody in our batch he is a master in computer games.....<br>So coming back to his nature....  he is very talkative <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( Aks do you remember the Algo classes in which we used to talk abt either AOE or House <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....   doesn't want to remain in his room ( as he is always ready for Dominoes ( ask Maglu ) or for playing AOE ( ask Scientist ) ) <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  Don't think that he only plays computer games....   he is very studious too but he is a geek in the true sense of the word....<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He will never do anything which he finds boring or less interesting...   he will not even copy those assignments <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> but if he finds something interesting, he will not leave it <img src=Smileys/41.gif />...  I remember when we did Graphics project together and  I didn't have to do anything...  he wrote the complete code himself and with great efficiency <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Extremely interested in graphics he never tried to pursue that interest which I think he shd have <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> We have had long talks abt others when we were alone in GHEB....  so he knows a lot of things abt me <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br>Well I think the ideal job for you would be in making animated movies as you like coding as long as you can see the output <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> You are also ideal for MBA but the risk that if you don't find the job interesting you will leave it <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <br>A very respected guy ( I have never seen anybody making his fun except for me and Atul <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )....   but also extremely careless ( which is one of the things I hate <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> abt him)... </b></i></ul><br><br>
