<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>PK aka Roomie</u><br><br>He was the first person with whom I did BC, back when I didnt know about the existence of the word <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Will always remember  that train journey while coming to IIIT for the first time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Hum logon ne raat bhar BC ki thi. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its always so nice being with him, dunno bande mein aisa kya hai, jab bhi baat hoti hai ekdum alag hi comfort level aata hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He must be the guy who knows the most about my kisse. He freaking knows about each and every girl in my life and all the related incidents <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Hamesha dil khol ke baat hoti hai apni. He was the first close friend of mine in IIIT after all roomie tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Later on, we sort of drifted apart but even then jab bhi baat hoti hai, its always like the days of yore. Even recently, when we were talking about a date of mine which I cancelled for some reason, he was one person jisko batane mein mujhe bilkul bhi odd nahin lag raha tha. Although would have felt a bit strange talking about it to anybody else <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Luv you man <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>And please khud ko aur room ko thoda kam badbudar rakha kar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Time ki kami.. will write an achha sa testi for u later <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I forgot to mention about his appetite, although I didn't witness I've heard many stories of his huge appetite and about his records, be it about eating maximum no. of rotis in Yuktahaar or at some buffet outside! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>A true Delhite and an awesome person. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of those with whom I've had only dinner table conversations, which have been quite interesting. At one time time we talked about Greek and Roman mythologies, next time we talked about life in general, and on some third occasion we talked about sitcoms and so on.<br>At one time in second semester, when I was stuck in a code, wasn't able to complete it, he explained the logic the code should follow which made things easier for me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We also danced at Club 8 on the occasion of my first time of drinking...<br>He's someone who suggests me time and again, "live life to the fullest" which seems to be the principle he follows faithfully. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>He has an awesome knowledge of films and can enact any film, literally any film if there are no time limitations. And would never give up. Never ever give up. I like that attitude of yours buddy. Then comes 3rd year and this guy becomes my wing-mate. We have tried our max to keep our wing clean. Unlike me, can never keep his own room clean. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Room par bahut garmi hoti thi isiliye hum watercooler ke paas soya karte the. Those were like awesome days man! You remember!?<br><br>He's a very big BCbaaz. raat raat bhar BC karta tha aur din bhar sota rehta tha. I used to wake him up for the classes and he'd say "Haan! Uth gaya.. aa raha hoon" aur fir so jata tha. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. BC ki baat aa hi gayi hai to bata doon ki ye banda kahani sunane me mahir hai. <b> Muft ka gyaan baantne me bhi pakka hai</b> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>He's got a unique style of addressin everyone. Calls me "loundey", "chotu" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. and hence I call him "lambu". I never had friends whose height was more than mine rigth from mmy childhood days(Bachpan me main bhi lamba hua karta tha yaar!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). But now that convention is changed. I'm now friends with a 6"2 monster. But to be true, he's a kid at heart. A very nice guy. He's like a big brother to me, always gives me good advices (like drink daru <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, don't smoke, watch this movie, read that novel etc etc)<br><br>In first year, we were sitting in NBH mess having our breakfast and this guy comes to me and says "Hey! Do you know elections are coming closer? Please vote for me for the sportscom post.". I didn;t even know him, but there was some positive vibe in his way of talking that I was convinced to vote to him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and from then onwards we were like great friends. He has a very special place for friends (and also F.R.I.E.N.D.S <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) in his heart.<br><br>In second year, he was Maroo's roomie and I used to come to his room most of the time for doing ITWS project and this guy used to sleep like a bull. I sometimes still wonder that how come these two guys were room mates. I mean even today these guys fight for the "worst-room" in OBH competition. In 2nd year, I saw this guy very angry at somebody during the IBCT. I wish I'd never seen that scene. He was completely out of control. I, out of nowhere, wanted to control his anger but he's such a huge monster and I'm just a 5 point someone in front of him.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Lets start from the beginning. First day of my college, I come to cellar and in my room. Two rooms next to me there are two people from Delhi. One is tall, dark, handsome and a little shabby. The other one, well we will talk about him in his testi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In first meeting, you cant help but notice the clarity with which he utters every word. Everything he says are measured and moulded by his strong thoughts and experiences engraved in the pages of his life.<br>If its been fantastic four years, its mostly because of his friendship with me. He has been there to listen to my thoughts, to take away my sorrows, to support me in moments of doubts. While my self-confident through out the four years was a sinosuidal graph, he always believed in me and has made me believe that I am no less. I remember the treat that he gave me in canteen because he heard that I got max marks in some subject, which I didnt get of course <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He was happy for me and I was happy that I have such a friend. Thats the best treat I have had and no other can come even close to it. <br>I cant recount here the various discussions we have had on the topics ranging from personal matters to philosophical and from political to social. One thing that defines him is his strong belief in whatever he believes. He is an avid reader. The thoughts that he has extracted from his readings and his experiences shaped him into what he is today. He doesnt get affected by someone's views easily. You have to covince him and even then he would have a doubt in a corner of his mind. He will think it over and over and test it before he is actually convinced of the idea. Thats how strong his character is. <br>He holds a very special place for his close friends and would go to any lengths to make sure that his friends are happy and safe. And the feelings are reciprocated by his friends. If you ask his friends about him they wont stop praising him and then they will tell you about his gluttony <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He manages to impress anyone in the first meeting itself. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Even if you are a superstar he will shift the limelight towards himself, effortlessly.<br>I cant thank you enough for the moral support that you have given me and I take pride in having a friend in you. Be the way you are and success will want to be with you. <br>May God bless you and may our friendship grow by the minute.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 4 </b></i><br><br>Needless to mention, he got back to his lazy ways after getting placed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He was a heavy boozer earlier, but consciously stays within his limits these days. You could get anything out of him earlier, but these days during booze sessions, he hardly ever tells anything about himself. Except the recent session, when he narrated his entire story <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And didn't we enjoy it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Other memories with him include Graphics course and being partners; work for Felicity; walk during the scuffle time (When I tried convincing him to apologize); listening to his amazingly unbelievable stories (which he claims are true <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ); leofying him during the recent cricket match; leofying him for the way he runs, especially during BB matches <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ; promising to work out together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ; listening to BB boys (He is bbb freak) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ; rusticating him for lack of personal cleanliness (He doesnt have bath for days, wears the same shirt for days- both for working out and normally.. yuck!); trying to wake him up (You have to have a burning iron rod for that!); encouraging him to blog (He is a terrific writer.. Has a way with words) etc.<br><br>He is a thinker, and an independent person. He is a Delhitie, but a very different one at that. He has principles and will always stand by them, some of them are unflappable. And I really appreciate him for that. <br><br>I'll miss PK and all his vagaries. All the very best in life mate! May God bless.<br><br><b>Characters he represents: Aladdin and Jughead<br>Fav memory: The long talks in the room.<br>Message for him: Dare you forget me! </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 3 </b></i><br><br>Third year was when I saw another aspect of his. I decided to take the plunge for Felicity, and expected a lot from my group. And I was surprised to see that apart from Chand and Pagare, he was the one who really took an amazing amount of responsibility upon him. He had so much passion for sponsorships, I was amazed. If I had to count 10 people who worked the most for Felicity '08, he'd be one of them. He did things by taking initiative, remember collecting names of non-IT companies? Even during the three days, he handled singing when somebody else could not do it. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>The second time I saw him putting that kind of effort was for Placements. I think he started preparing right from the start of the seventh semester - and inspired a whole lot of people around him. That was also when he got the name 'Joshi' (from Josh) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But well, he does not like it when we use that name.. Its fun leofying him though <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Come the first day of placements, and he was among the most frustrated souls. Day two was very important. We gave the Amazon and Adobe tests and were coming back when the Amazon written results came. Strike three. He was as shattered as one could get. On the way back to the mess, I tried consoling him, but couldn't do so, given my own state of mind. And that was when I got the good news that both of us had cleared the Adobe written. He was delighted when I gave him the news. We spent the next few hours together, and he gave some amazing interviews. I remember, in each of my interviews, the interviewers asked me about Prashant. He was a certainty; and we were the two guys remaining at the end of all the rounds. My fate that they just took one person, but I was very happy for him that day <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . What better than Prashasti and he getting placed in the same company! Later, he helped me a lot with C++ concepts, and thanks for all that <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2 </b></i><br><br>We started hanging out together, we had a lot of night outs and outings in the second sem. I'll probably call the best sem among the eighth we've had- it was so much fun. Did I mention that hes the most fodu coder I've seen. His knowledge of C++ is deep, we actually had the course back in class twelve. I remember frequently asking him for Sumita Arora to read C++ from it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Second year. I decided to move to cellar, as that was where most of my friends lived. PK agreed to be my roomie, and there started a new saga. We started talking a lot to each other, and became good friends. However, I've always (till date) had this feeling that PK has never been very close to me- he shares till a certain level, but not beyond that. I guess thats because he has other very close people around him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Nevertheless, we used to chat a lot. Hes always had an irregular schedule- generally sleep during the day and stay awake in the night. I was more of a lark and he the owl. So sometimes, it would be days before we got to interact to each other- but that was never a deterrent; when we spoke, we did it as if we were continuing yesterday's conversation <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . We spoke about a lot of things- careers, girls, computer science, graphics, real estate etc <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He opened up to me (till a certain level) and so did I; we had a great time together. Both of us were filthy, and hence there was no problem of keeping the room neat <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Our room back then was among the dirties rooms one could possibly live in <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But we didn't give it a rat's ass!<br><br>Let me mention here that PK is one of the laziest yet the most active guy. He'd sleep for hours and hours together, get up have a few packets of chips and biscuits and get back to sleep! Ahhh chips.. Well, he absolutely dotes on food. There are three passions in his life- food, sitcoms and the third one is obvious <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . Just put him in a room with food and sitcoms- and he needs nothing else. Given a chance, he'll not come out for days <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1 </b></i><br><br>PK, so many memories associated with this good friend of mine. Bitter, sweet- they've all been there. <br><br>Flashback to July 2005. We'd all just come in; that was also the time when the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series had released. Now I tried getting hold of the book, but to no avail. That was when this chap told me that he was going to read the e-version of the book. Now those were the days when the workspace PCs would always be occupied, and hence we'd use the library PCs. I went to the library and found this asshole reading the book on the library PC. I got pissed at this, especially given that I had some important work and he refused to budge for a long time :X .<br><br>For such incidents and another issue, I abhorred him back then. I found him an irritating bastard, who hung out with the other assholes like Himank, Vipul etc. I am amazed to look back at those moments now and realize that these are my closest chums today <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Never judge a book by its cover - how true.<br><br>Slowly, driven by a common passion for Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl, we started bonding. The next incident was his birthday. In the morning, I wished him and asked him for a treat, which he promised. But this fucker - the ass that he was never treated me- in spited of treating some of his other friends. That was when I realized that we could never be close pals, I even confronted him regarding this. <br><br>That issue of him giving importance only to a few people and having a "fuck them all" attitude towards the others led to THE fight in the group back in first year. That was after TB was formed, and PK and I found ourselves in the same set of people. That was a sad incident, and I remember everyone sitting in one of the rooms and crying about it. (I'd actually never imagined that friendship could get so emotional). I think that incident changed PK a lot. That day, he came and spoke to me, and we had a real heart to heart to talk. I think thats the time when we <i>actually</i> became friends.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br><br>Is bande ko bilkul last time par doosron se padhna achcha lagta hai aur fir ise us time mein us topic par research bhi karni hoti hai. But, one thing is for sure that he is very intelligent. Puzzles solve karta tha placements ke time bahut saari. Humse agar koi puzzle solve nahi hoti thi to hum 10-15 mins mein ya max 20-25 mins mein bol dete the ki ab solution batao, but ye to kai baar do-do din tak ek puzzle par laga rehta tha. The way he studied for placements definitely deserves an accolade. He and Bajju are the two guys who were most prepared for the placements and both got placed on 2nd day of placement session <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . This guy thinks a lot about things. Koi bhi kaam karne se pehle uske negative points ke baare mein sochta hai. Iske saath kai baar kuch discussions hui hain and I liked his views. Remeber that discussion on compulsory attendance. Abhi ke liye itna hi. Bhool mat jaiyo Bangalore jakar. Contact mein rahiyo aur call karta rahiyo. All the best for ur future. God bless <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br><br>Pk<br><br>Bhangi saala. Kitna kam nahata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Kitna jyada khata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Yes, a testimonial for PK must start with his eating and bathing habits. But if I'm writing a testimonial for him, then "Teen (3) " must be mentioned before other things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I hit him 3 punches on Chand's birthday when I got angry aur tab se ye hamesha mujhe yaad dilata rehta hai. Sorry for that buddy. But that added to one of my memorable incidents here <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Hamesha room mein baitha chips khata rahega aur koi na koi TV series dekhta rahega. We both like FRIENDS a lot and there is a division in group over that 70s and FRIENDS. Some memories include that 3 incident of course, breakfast in OBH mess where I, he and Bhalu were discussing "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and were laughing like anything. All of those who were in mess that time were looking at us in amazement that what has happened to these 3 guys, and one more would be when Maroo, Vipul and me made him to do 10 sit-ups. We told him that there is some big news which we will tell him only when he'll do 10 sit-ups and he did those only to find out that there was no such news <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Again, sorry for that if you felt bad but that was just for fun and nothing else dude.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Very good friend of mine. He is the one who always wishes me with a smile. Cool attitude. Prashasti is correct in her testimonial. I also personally feel First impression is the best but one shouldn't stick to it. I never forget the day when you said that " May be today is your day get ready for it" at the time of placement sessions. It helped me a lot.<br>         He is the typical IIIT guy plz never go to his room. All da best for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>...and i want to add that PK helped me a lot in my placement by boosting my confidence<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> a couple of times(that really helped me a lot). After i came back from the placement party i gave, i regretted that i forgot to call you<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> So i owe u a party!<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>(...sorry for the spelling mistakes<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> in the previous testimonial, i'm not used to notepad<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> )</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>So finally a testimonial for PK. This guy is one of the very few perons I really admire and appreciate in this college. Not just becoz he a food freak or sth but becoz he a very simple, helping and down to earth kind of guy, has a great smile and is a treasure to have as a friend.<br>        I actually never interated with him in the first 3 years <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and to be precise I first interacted with him in 4th year when i shifted to OBH and found that he was mt neighbour!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        You'll mostly find him in hsi old rugged jeans, messed up hair and a big pack of chips in his hands...He is a great admirer (me too<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) of good movies and TV series and obviouly Junk Food!<br>        Since I used to go for a jog every morning, I asked him one day to join me and thought that may be i'll help him loose some weight (since he was concerned), But I seriously failed! This guy, no matter what happens, no matter how bad things turn up, can never stop eating junk food and all that oily-stuff!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        I mean how can a person eat 12 potato-stuffed parathas in breakfast or 24 sandwiches in breakfast??...phew!! ..unbelievable. I dont even understand whr does all that stuff goes! <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>        For about an entire month I used to wake him up and take him to Yuktahar mess with me for a good non-oily breakfast<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>and then finally one day I saw him sneaking into his room with 2 big pack of American-Onion Lays! (the one he loves) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>But i guess no one can be Prefect! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>You got a great job u deserved and I wish you Best Of Luck for Everything!!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>A complete movie freak and is always ready to do BC on it . A few days back when I told him that haven't seen Rocky to ye banda poora senti ho gaya <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and cursed me a lot for that. Has read around 500+ novels and quite good at narrating stories as well, especially if the story is about his village, some fights or has some horror element in it. <br><br>Inspite of many good qualities and all the smartness that he has, he doesn't carry himself well. Won't take bath for days, bhangi saala <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and his room stinks like hell. Room kholta hai to poore wing mein badboo faila deta hai. The most funny part to look for are his hair with each in a different direction <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and appears more like a comic character. <br>His anger is completelty uncontrollable <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> though it is a very rare sight. Got to experience that for the first time in Goa when he had a fight with some local guy there. He can literally kill someone when he is angry.<br><br>Always there for helping his friends whenever they need him and even ready to fight for them. <br>Some sweet memories associated with him that I will always remember are - grand outing in 1st sem, his debugging my assignments in workspace, BC sessions in NBH-47 and 270s wing, Goa trip in Dec'07, puzzle solving sessions before placements, the joy on his face when he is about to eat some delicious food <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and many more.<br><br>All the best for your future. Keep rocking in B'lore and shake the city to its core. <br>God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav Memory</b> - Goa trip in Dec'07<br><b>Message for him</b> - Get out of your room and start enjoying the real life.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>PK - the first thing that comes to my mind after hearing this name is Food <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Have met a lot of people before who are passionate about many things but haven't seen someone who is so passionate about eating like this guy. For his love for food I will just say 'Iske liye saari duniya 1 taraf aur khana 1 taraf'. There are umpteen number of incidents relating him and food in these four years and I guess pages can be written on them but I prefer to skip them for now.<br><br>Got to know him first during our ragging period but at that time our interaction was limited to just Hi and Bye. But once our gang was formed it was really fun hanging out with him. In the first three years we saw less of each other, except for some outings or BC sessions, which was mainly because of the proximity factor. But with him moving to our wing this year I got to know more of him. <br>The Sitcom King of our batch, he prefers to stay aloof alongwith his lappy  in his room for almost the entire day  watching sitcoms and comes out only during meals. Just give him lots of food and his lappy and he will remain in his room forever. Has an excellent memory when it comes to remembering dialogues of some sitcoms and will say them word by word with perfection. Does get excited sometimes about things around him due to which he got the knick 'Joshi' (coined by Pappu) <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Comes up with some  really wacky ideas of doing some things but never actually takes the initiative to do the same and all that excitement fades away in no time. <br><br>Has oodles of unutilized talent inside him. Like he can be a good public speaker and a decent basketball player (even used to play this game ages ago) but his laziness takes the better of him always. A total brainy, especially when it comes to coding and solving puzzles. Has a carefree attitude towards acads but worked with complete dedication and determination during placements and got one of the best jobs in our batch which is indeed commendable <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is very sharp but less focused and very very <b>alsi</b>.<br>He is one of the most shabby person I have seen. <br>And you cannot do anything about it.Even breaking your head wont force him to take a bath<br> <br>But there are a few things he really cares about. I saw a nice example of his strong determination before placements, when he used to study day and night and he was so damn confident in the end.The biggest worry I had before placements was what if one of us gets placed earlier?<br>But God is gr8 we both got placed on the same day...one of my happiest moment in IIIT.<br> <br>It was 2nd day of placement, I got shortlisted for Amazon and he wasn't. I was more tensed for him then myself.<br>After 2 tiring interviews when I heard he got shortlisted for Adobe I knew he will do gr8 in interview <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and he did.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>After every interview he faced, he was more happy and confident.He has given one of the best interviews in our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif />and I am so proud of him.<br><br>He is a complete package, he is mature ,strong ,sensitive, witty, sporty and a lovable person.<br>He has influenced me a lot by his thoughts.The change I observe in myself today is a lot coz of him.<br>He is one of closest friend I ever had.He is a great guy and I have spent so much time with him that I think I can write an entire book on him.<br><br>May you be always happy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best buddy.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is a petu, khabbad,bhukhad...(to infinity). When it comes to food he is a kid...or call him Joey..he never ever shares his food.<img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>When he is eating he has no friends and no compromises.<br>If you take a bite from his food, he will have to have another one, for his satisfaction <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I remember the pillion<br>fights we had over food(when I take a spoon or a bite from his food for tasting <img src=Smileys/3.gif />).  <br>And he eats so slowly and so much <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> that at times you get bored watching him eat and eat.<br>He overeats all the time and has set many records like 32 roties in a meal in yuktahaar.<br>If it is not a buffet he always has the maximum bill <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and then complains how less others eat.<br>I used to be surprised how a person can eat an entire cheese burst after eating 20 puris in the mess.<br>But now I guess I know that if tomorrow he sets a Guiness book record for eating <img src=Smileys/77.gif />I wont be surprised.<br>Have you ever seen a person eating an entire box of sweets in one go? If not you must watch him eating sweets.<br>Every week he will buy himself a box of sweets and will eat them all by himself <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is different, one of the most confident guys I have ever met.Even when he knows he had screwed badly he never panics.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>One of the very few people who means when he says "I don't give a damn to people".<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>He is damn secure, he knows he is good and never listens to anybody.<br>One of his unique characteristics is that when you are becoming friends with him he will first tell how evil he is so that if you want to back out , do it then.<br>He can be manipulative ,persuasive and evil also at times.<i>He believes in 10 eye for an eye.</i><br>But when it comes to stand by a friend he is always there.<br><br>It may sound weird but he is sweet at times too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But it is a rare occasion <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and he hates to be called sweet(guy problem <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>Well when it comes to acads, he never pays attention in class(well he comes to class rarely),he will study at the last moment and will get all these logical doubts and irritates the one who is trying to teach him. <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.<br>cont.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met this guy in my first class in IIIT, I didn't like him at all;typical Delhi attitude.He seemed arrogant and stubborn.Guess my initial judgment is never correct.He is a wonderful person.<br>Though he was quite different from the friends I had earlier but he was was fun to be with. <br>I always wanted a cool group(the one they had in hip hip hurray -1 )in fact I had one with Chand, Shikha and him. And it was fun.We used to walk in campus everyday, sit on the stairs opposite to <br>library and then talk about our school life. He was not much of a talker but his stories <br>were awesome. The way he tells a story is very captivating.I bet I have heard all his childhood stories more the 50 times. His stories were generally about food and fights <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>By the end of first sem we were great pals . I remember when we parted during winter vacations,I so didn't want to go home. Second sem was the period when we had infinite walks almost daily.<br>I didn know how we managed 2nd sem academically.. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>I remember we all had gone for RDB and were so happy and excited after the interval<br>but he said - "U all will cry when the movie ends" and yeah we were all silent like hell after the movie.<br><br>Then came felicity 06, and <b>Ankita Khanna incident</b> happened.Everyone was shouting ,atmosphere was tensed and I was afraid, but he stood by me all night.That instant I realized that this friend will be always there for me.<br><br>We had had ups and downs in our friendship but I am proud that we survived and here we stand<br>still together.He is one of my best friends and there is nothing I cannot share with him.<br><br>Talking of him, he is big time movie jockey.He never runs out of things to watch.He watches every movie n times.If given an option to eat and watch movie only all his life I think he will be happy.<br>For he was the one coz of whom I started watching Hollywood movies.He has an entirely different view of watching a movie .His view is similar to the way a director would think.In future if he ever gets a chance to direct a movie, he will </b></i></ul><br><br>
