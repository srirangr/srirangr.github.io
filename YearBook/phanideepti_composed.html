<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;<br>      I know, i know, you did not expect a testimonial from me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Well, Suprise suprise! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>       One tricky question you can ask AK is ask him to choose which of the two are his favorites - WWE or ECE .. He will have a real tough time choosing one of the two. I say, ECE ka kya hai, choose WWE dude <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>      We both were in the same college (or jail) in our 12th. He was this <i><b> phodu </b></i> in Physics, something at which I totally sucked. Still, I never gave him a chance to come first in class <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>           I started talking to him only through his friends Prateek and Sharat and they totally totally love him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He watches a lot of TV series, WWE, football and what not! Not a big fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> grrr.. <br><br>     I think everybody must have changed from the way they were initially during their stay in IIIT, but Karthik I guess is an exception. It would be really nice if you break this record of being the same as you were <i>bachpan mein</i> - just a solicitous advice <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>     I thought you would finish off your MS even before we finish our B.Tech <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , but anyways all the very best for your future. We will stay in touch and yeah, I started watching WWE and it rocks m/ </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samish.html>Samish Chandra Kolli</a></b>&nbsp;<br>      ahh.. I wanted to be the first to write a testimonial for you..Damn you!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. Anyways, here is a testimonial for my <i>maha-kasi</i> colleague..I really wish we are not in the same team, our manager would start comparing our work and I dont want any more  of <i>"see he is soo good at his work and you are .."</i> sessions with my boss.<br>   <br>      We share our woes, being in CVIT, then we were TA's for the most awesome course - Maths-III. He was all this dedicated TA initially, but I taught him not to be, because it is God Venki's course and you dont work for God Venki. <br><br>He always seems to be mad at something, whining for some reason <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, well you don't have to be so all the time you know! <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  Never seen a person who can talk more than he does on phone. Dude, why dont you just accept <b>the</b> fact that you have a GF and stop telling the whole college absolutely unbelievable stories as to whom are you talking to on phone <img src=Smileys/10.gif />      <br><br>Wishing you all the very best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>          A genius, even the word genius sounds like an understatement when it comes to talk about you. All the interactions we had are always impersonal and of what I could know about him - he is this guy with an equal blend of religiousness and practicality, something which is not quite easy to find and to manage. It is quite difficult to balance equally both of them, but he has got the talent to do it.<br><br>           It is really amazing the amount of efforts you have put up as a placement lead <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . <br>I whole heartedly thank you for your interest in Samvedana and your whole hearted involvement in the initial stages when an individual dream was taking a shape into something concrete. Hoping to work with you for Samvedana, in Samvedana. Wishing you truck loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>        I am sure you are not expecting a testimonial from me. But here I go.<br><br>       I have never spoken to him and I dont really know him at the personal front, as much as his senior female friends know him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> But, I keep calling him <b> research paper churner</b> ..Something gets into his head and comes out as a research paper, I tell him.<br><br>     A brilliant coder, hmm..the word <i> brilliant</i> seems to be an understatement, you were and are and would always be one person I have always looked upto, I respect you from the bottom of my heart for your single minded dedication and indelible efforts towards your goals. People like few things and they stick to it.. Very few people actually bring out the things that they dont like and so openly point them out. You are one of them!<br><br>     He initially came off as quite an arrogant guy. I cannot forget the Felicity campaigning where I was teamed with him and we both gave a tough time to each other, absolutely not listening to each other, fighting and leading to making the whole campaigning a disaster <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>   Wishing you loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kishorepudi.html>Kishore Pudi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>        Every time we meet, I sing a song for him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .Yes, I do. And the song is - Pudi baba pudi baba pudi baba hoo [in the same lines of hodi baba hodi baba [of the bike Caliber] <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Though we never really spoke to each other neither do we know much about each other, everytime we speak, we talk as if we are really good friends. He is very approachable, and it is fun teasing him with names. All the small chats we have on gtalk are totally awesome.<br><br>     The best memory would be samish and me teasing you by trying to guess your gf's name in lab-331. I was really very happy when he got placed, a very well deserved candidate I must say, but the testing times had taken a toll on him. Keep rocking and ya, do some crash dieting stuff da!<br><br>    I have a message for you, learn to take credit for what you do. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>      Akash is one of those studs of EC, something which never got into my head.The first time I spoke to him was we having such a bad fate to get the <b>deadliest</b> panel anybody can ever think of - pjn, jayanthi and Kamal. We used to share our woes, <i> ek doosre ki kitni watt lagti hai advisor ke haaton mein</i>, etc.<br> <br>      Then we worked in Philips together and thats when I got to know more about him. Me being, hmm.. a moderate talker <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, I used to narrate such stories every day about such arbit stuff. It was like during lunch, he used to say, <i>aur kya chal raha hai tere roomie ke saath? </i> and bang, I kept going on and on, jumping from one topic to the other, going on and on and on.. But I even gave you chance to talk <i>beech beech mein </i>, dint I? I used to tease him with literally every freaking lady who passed our way during our lunch, we used to make fun of our project manager etc etc.<br><br>     I wish you truck loads of good luck. Stay in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ambati.html>Bharat Ram Ambati</a></b>&nbsp;<br>     Every time you see him, he greets you with a warm smile making you wonder if he always this pleasant. He is one of the most soft spoken guys I have ever met, truly. Quite passionate about his work, has a couple of research papers in his kit, and I am pretty sure before he leaves -H, he is going to write a lot more only to make his God Father all the more proud to have him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>    Its through Samvedana that I started knowing him at the personal front and I truly respect him for the way he had trod through the tough times and has reached the state he is right now. He shares the passion that is so seldomly found in general in people - a passion to do something good for the people, a passion that there should be happiness around. It is very easy to pull his leg and yes, people, he has a thing for that lady in the academic section. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br><b>Message to you:</b>  Be a little less conservative and a little less emotional. These are few things which sometimes bog down our success. A little more practicality would only do more good. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>         Yes,  we were in the same house and yes, we have had a chance to interact and become friends but no, we did not. For the first three years, I do not remember having a proper conversation with him. Blogging for one and Samvedana is really how I got a chance to know him better. Here, I must admit I was slightly shocked when he initially started showing genuine interest in Samvedana. Never really expected him to become a part of Samvedana but now I claim  that I am proud to have him in our team. He is passionate about few things - his writing and Samvedana which I know are very important to him. He undoubtedly is the best blogger of our batch. Writing is all about getting the emotions in your head eloquently and Aniket is gifted in doing that and I bow to thee. Another thing which I very much admire in him is his candidness which can be evidently seen in his blog. <br><br>	Best memories that I share with you would be the mango eating session in yuktahaar, the hariharan concert, the funny photoshoot we had for some magazine. Not to forget the <i>shayari</i> thing we attended, where only you were genuinely interested in what that fellow was saying and I, in my usual way, was making fun of literally everything over there, irritating you and Prateek <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Prateek and Sashi actually took my away from that place, well, because I was disturbing every person sitting over there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>      It was fun knowing you, even though it was at the fag end of the year, I am glad that we have become good friends. Thanks to Samvedana, we will always be in touch and  will work together. <br><br>Wishing you truck loads of best wishes and keep up the same passion you share for few things in your life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>    This might have come off as a suprise, but here you go.<br><br>	Karan is one of the guys I have always looked upto for what he does and for what he is. The way he manages his work, his relationships and all the extra curriculars - be it cricket, be it organizing any event, is just amazing. We would really like to hear from you  few of those <i>How-to-efficiently-manage-your-time</i> lectures. Everything he does, he does it with perfection. Its exams season and you can always spot Karan either in library or in the reading room. Its <i>masti</i> time, and you find Karan being the first to pull others legs. Its time to take up responsibility and you have him as one of the major head. Its inspiring Karan, the passion you have for what you do and the way you do what you do. From placements to Felicity, he has always given his best shot for everything <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I have never really known him at the personal front but I do know that he is the gossip girl of -H, if you ever want to share some news to the whole campus but don't know how, you need to pass that info to one of these three people - harshi, karan or chand, and your wish is granted.<br><br>	Wishing you truck loads of good luck and hope you always achieve what you dream for, because you deserve every  bit of it! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>      I get only one thing, just one thing when I hear his name or see him somewhere - OMG its Samrat, oka 2-3 jokes vesestadu ippudu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Peru chaala baga pettaru - you are the 'king' of classic jokes <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Example ga rendu mudu: </b><br><br>1) Samrat and 2 other victims were going on a bike somewhere. The poor old guard stopped them saying "mugguru oke bike meeda campus lo tiragaka kudadu." Little did he know what was in store for him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Mana classic king, Samrata gaaru andukunnaru - "Telusu, andukane kada campus ninchi bayataki vellipotunnam". We had to rush the guard to the nearest hospital because there was some complications in his brain because of that joke.<br><br>2) Charan it seems was not able to find the mouse of his laptop and was searching in every room in OBH. And he also entered Samrat's room and asked "orey, na mouse ni chusava?" . Samrat gave that wicked look for 1 second, Charan understood he is going to get something worser out of him and before he could escape, Samrat did not give him a chance and said "Na cooler lo oka mouse tirugutondi, na room lo inkoti undi, neeku edi kavali ?" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Charan lost his mind and was roaming in the hostel the same way for the next 2 days shouting Samrat's name <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>And do you know, who told me all these jokes, Samrat himself! He has this wicked grin and he feels oh-so-elated whenever he shares his knowledge of classic jokes with poor chaps like us! He very much admires Spandana's jokes - that is what we call made for each other friendship <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>         All this apart, he is a wonderful guy. We have been friends right from our first semester - which means we have been pulling each others leg right from our first year. He is a great friend, always nice to talk to. Have a great time at LPU <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Loads of love and best wishes <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> Part 2 </b><br><br>        It was for SE presentation that we started talking, I know how difficult I was with everybody, pushing people to work etc. We shared the stage together for one really funny skit, eating chips on the dais, etc. We both were the victims of CVIT and used to tell our woes to each other, only becoming closer. Then Samvedana happened, and I am glad that it did, because, not just did we are trying to do something good to others, a lot of us have become a lot closer than we were before <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>	The innumerable number of <i>sollu</i> sessions we had in cog sci lab with you and bhargava where I just used to barge into the lab and start blabbering wasting your precious time. To top this all, the best memory would be the five hour marathon in cie lab quite recently where  you, sharat, sashidhar, prateek and myself were reading, or should I say, enacting what was written for him, by him .. ahem ahem <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. This I consider as one of the best memories I share with you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	Finally, I hope you reach the greatest heights which you aim for in your life. You can, I am sure and you deserve to reach there. Wishing you truck loads of best wishes <br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> Part 1 </b><br><br>         Bava gaaaruuu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Mee kosam final ga testimonial ready aipoyindi andi..Meeku hindi chaala baga vachu ani, hindi lone rayadaniki try chesanu. Naaku anta baaga raadu. Emanna grammar mistakes aithe kshaminchandi, asalu artham ee tappu aithe.. manninchandi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Okay, Gopal ek bahut acha banda hai. Gopal ko meerabai bahut pasand hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Iski hindi mashaallah hai. Mujhe jalan hai iski hindi se <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>         OA chaala ekkuva aindi kada? So here goes a testimonial for Goki (sorry, can i call you so, or is it like <b>the</b> name which only <b>the</b> conferrer can use? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ).<br><br>	Jokes apart, Gopal is one of the persons whom I admire the most for one thing - sticking to what you like doing, even when the whole world is not really supportive. You like your good old culture, your traditions, your language, your principles, you want to stick to it. People around you sometimes mock at you, do not share the same passion as you have, and at some point of time, you slack and give up - This is the normal story, nothing new. But, there are few people who actually stand against the tide and it takes a lot of courage to do so and Gopal is one of them. I admire him for this from the bottom of my heart. <br><br>	 But, he is not conservative when it comes to dreaming big and working towards them. I admire him for the effort he has been putting towards his work for Muse, his own MS thesis and last but never the least - Samvedana. Its our brain child, I keep telling him and we need to nurture it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He calls me a perfectionist, I call him someone who stands one step above the perfectionist zone. I never really expected you can bear all the stupid jokes I crack about him, about others, in short my blabber <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>     I,for the first time started talking to him, I guess during placements. He was really very supportive throughout those testing times and especially on the day I got placed. He and Kranthi came to the placement venue for some other reason Looking at how disappointed I was about the absolute mess which was created by the CIQ HRs, they both stuck by me, boosting my completely down morales from 7 till 10:30 in the night, not once leaving by my side. I was and I am even now overwhelmed by the exceedingly sweetness of your heart on that day for being so so supportive. Had it not been yours and Kranthi's support, I would have totally jacked my final round of interview. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Then, Samvedana came into life and through his involvement I got to know more about him. <br><br>        He is a real nice guy, gem at acads and the one who is really really helpful to all his friends <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . Now that I know a lot of things about him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , I give him a lot of tough time, pulling his leg and it is absolute fun talking to him. Yet, he is so humble and simple with a pleasant smile always on his face. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br><b>Message for you :<.b> Learn to be more assertive. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Wishing you truck loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>         There will be 3-4 chat windows open, there will be some loud music being played, somebody will be trying to teach him sitting beside him and he will be listening to music, ensuring the pissed off person who is so laboriously trying to teach him, reading 2-3 blogs and chatting - all the four things at a time. If you are thinking, well we all do that on just any other day, no. My dear friends, thats Himank for you, just hours before exams <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	When I try to reel back and think when was the first time that we spoke and how exactly did we become good friends, my memory gives me away. I think it was through Prashant that we met. Himank is a total BC baaz, you only have to have 25 hours a day to listen to his stories. We always have a lot of topics to talk - movies, music, books , blogs .. He is quite passionate about his blog and is very regular at it. A guy totally stung by BEATLES, a co-lover of NIRVANA and Curt <img src=Smileys/1.gif />Knowing him so well, I can never form a mental picture Himank studying, but hell, he is a total <b>BOND</b>.. The fact that he cracked CAT without much effort shows how damn intelligent he is. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>	The best memory for me would be the way we all played in the rain back in 2nd semester  after our endsems which was followed making paper planes - it indeed is one of the best memories I am going to take back from IIIT. Another would be the jal jeera 'shot' we had during Nishant's treat - absolute disaster it was. Even before I took I sip, Himank finished the whole glass. Apparently he is an expert in taking shots.. Bad.. very bad!!<br><br>	Wishing you truck loads of good luck and yes, do stay in touch, atleast for the sake of the treat that I owe you <img src=Smileys/3.gif />	</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>"Hey Chand!" <br>"Hey Deeps, kya kar rahi hai?"<br><br>--<br><br>This is the way we have <b> always </b> been greeting each other - from day-1 in -H to even now! We have been in the same class, in the same English group and yes, we never really spoke that much in the initial days, but we always really enjoyed the conversations every time we spoke. I see a lot of change in him, not just in his dressing style or in his physique but most importantly a change in him as a person. The change is definitely for good and guess what, the liking has only increased towards this new avtar of his <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has always been considered as a major head being involved in every major issue related to our batch. Every time I see him now, the only thing we talk about is how to reduce the number of cigs he consumes. <br><br>     Yes, he is a brilliant dancer, yes, he is a brilliant spokesperson and yes, he is just amazing when it comes to organizing events <img src=Smileys/41.gif />  - something which I am sure everybody must of written about Chand. Here is something which I think I know about you: <br><br>+  He is the <b>the macho</b> of our batch - is the first impression. Hardly do people know that behind this sturdy body, there exists an exceedingly sensitive, lovable and caring heart.<br><br>+ He is the person whose contact base touches each and every batch of IIIT. He is the most favorite senior of many many juniors and also favorite junior of many seniors <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> - is what everybody knows about him. Very few know how he sometimes prefers being Chand, just Chand like just another guy and not like Chand sir.<br><br>	We have had our share of low times in our friendship and I am only very glad that we have handled it so amazingly well and are such good friends that we are right now and I sincerely wish we continue to be the same in the coming years. Loads of love and best wishes <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part2 </b><br><br>       The breakfast outing of ours, where everything was so unplanned and we went all the way ending up drinking watermelon juice and paying a forture for that, all the amazing chats we have had, <i>leofying</i> sessions in EPP class, ahh..I <b>am</b> going to miss all these like hell! I am sure I have hurt you in many ways than I think I did for my own ignorance, my hearfelt apologies for the same. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>    He is the friend of a lifetime. I from my part am sure that I will never forget him and will always be there for him [the way they say in the title track of FRIENDS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ]and I hope he will be there for me. And hell, Why won't he? We are such great friends!<br> <br>    Wishing you truck loads of good luck and happiness <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>part 1</b><br><br>     Oh, I have given this fellow so many names, I have pissed him off for so many reasons, and it is so easy to annoy him and pull his leg - just tease him with <b>some</b> girl <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, and there you go!<br><br>      I myself was not an extrovert initially and add to it the fact that this fellow was one of the most silent guys in first year, probably always stuck in his fantasy world <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, I still wonder how we have become such great friends that we are right now! We have changed so much as compared to the way we were in the first year but our friendship is as sweet as it was initially.  With Shrikant, it has always been quite comfortable from the first time we started talking in the first year. Came second year and  we started sharing some of the deepest secrets with each other and it is always great to talk to him and hang out with him. He is one of the very few friends of mine with whom I share my thoughts, without a second thought. It is just easy, for some reason, words start flowing smoothly when talking to him. I can be myself, do all the swearing I do, never once thinking twice if doing so will make him go all judgemental about me. A great listener that he is, combined with his matured thinking, he has bailed me out of some of my most difficult times and I am grateful to him for that. I take the honour of being one of the very few people on whom he confided some his very personal thoughts.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>     He is a guy with quite sensible dress sense, great physique, loves reading fiction, watching a lot of movies, has a passion for photography and pursues it quite seriously <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> and a guy as lazy as the laziest living being on earth. So lazy that he cannot lift his hand and pick up his cell phone and call me when I got hurt, so lazy that he cannot move his butt from his comfy room to see me when I came back from hospital <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, so lazy that he does not even go and meet his own professor for his own grades!!

<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>       Of what I know of Kranthi, he is one of the greatest friends of Charan, a brilliant cricketer, a total fun loving guy and a great planner (reference: your basara trip <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, kidding!). I remember Kranthi saying to Charan once in the first year about me that I always had this drawn face as if I have all the world's problems on me. It was for the first time I have heard of Kranthi. Then it was through Kd and anu who were already quite close to him that I got to know more about him, got into talking and I have a lot of respect for the amount of care and affection he has in his heart for his friends.<br>        <br>         He is now an active member of Samvedana and I very much rely on his judgements and advice and comments because they are so genuine and correct. Thats the reason why I force him to come attend every meeting <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> The way he is making time for Samvedana inspite of his workload about which he is always pissed off for some reason is truly appreciable.<br>       <br>         I cannot forget my placement day when the whole situation was chaotic and I was,well not in my usual way <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He and Siva Reddy came to the placement venue for some other reason and they were done with it in a minute. Looking at my frustration and disappointment as to how things <br>were messed up, they both stuck by me, boosting my completely down morales from 7 till 10:30 in the night. They did not leave for dinner,they did not leave for the other engagements they had that night. I honestly owe my job to you both, if you guys wouldn't have been there for me, I don't really see myself getting placed that day. <br>    <br>     You might think I am actually making it all the more mushy for no reason but I really thankyou for your immense support you have always <br>given me - be it Samvedana, be it during my placements. I am glad that you are a part of Samvedana and we can and will be touch even after getting out of -H. Wishing you truck loads of best wishes and may you get the best in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>        We never spoke nor did I know any about Rohit before Samvedana. He has been quite an active member right from the first meeting he attended. All I know of  him is through the meetings and discussions we have about Samvedana. He is sharp, very intelligent and very difficult to convince on any point, one of the strongest critic of the decisions made for Samvedana - a trait which is very important for SAM to grow . Of what I have got to know of him, he is quite a stud in acads (through your constant complaints about workload <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), caring about his family and friends and is quite practical, completely crazy about cricket <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , I think he bows before Sachin daily in the morning when he gets up <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He has worked a lot for Felicity'08, for batch trip and now for Samvedana  <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>      With you in team, I am confident that Samvedana will grow bigger and spreads its wings far and wide. Wishing you loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=charan.html>Charan Thota</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br> Charan is the only person on whom I confided the idea of Samvedana for the first time. He gave me the first push to proceed forward with this idea. He is the first to ask me to slow down, think back for being very unplanned and helped Samvedana is tredding on a better path. If Samvedana is  going great, its key functionary is you, Charan. Being a co-founder of Samvedana, the amount of efforts he is putting for making our dream - Samvedana so successful is truly commendable. <br><br>       Charan is one friend whom everybody It just helps in reinstating your lost faith in friendship. If I am what I am right now, what people term me as being strong, bold to take my own decisions, I truly owe to one person and that is you. Thank you for being such a great friend of mine.<br><br>       May you always get the best in life because you deserve every bit of it! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=charan.html>Charan Thota</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1   <br><br>  Charan is undoubtedly one of my very few closest friends in -H. Its all hazy as to how we got together but I remember just one thing - at the end of first year, we were the closest of friends. I am glad that we did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He helped me <i></i> number of times and bailed me out of the crisis situations. I have never seen anybody more caring than our family but Charan is an exception. He goes an extra mile to help his friends. <br><br>      He is no human- sleeps at such odd hours, I dont know when he manages to get something into his stomach but I am sure 5 out of 7 days they go to a place somewhere near Punjagutta only to get some Dosas at 4:00 AM in the night. Yes, he is a great fan of non-vegetarian food and he goes somewhere in Mehdipatnam to get biryani.. Well, thats about food. Next comes how much he likes  <i> gaali tirugudu </i>. I remember how much he felt off when there was a restriction regarding the movement of people in and out of campus, though for only few days,<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .He was one of the most important pillar for Felicity'08 and is simply brilliant at organizing events, activities anything, you name it! He always has these amazing stories to narrate - about his life before he entered IIIT, his crushes, his  family.  <br><br>       We fell apart for some unfortunate reasons, we still spoke, but he changed a lot by then. But, Samvedana brought us together and I cannot express how glad I am for that. Charan was the first and probably the only person to whom I can ever tell anything that is in my mind because I am quite sure he is listening to me and is not making fun of the emotions.  He is not the kind of person who would lie to you so that you are happy. He has been one of my greatest critic and I sincerely thank you for that. <br><br>     </b></i></ul><br><br>

Thats something, ain't it? Give him the most boring story - he adds so much of <i>mirchi masala</i> and narrates it back to you, making it so damn hilarious.

<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>       There was this mail sometime in 2nd year as to who those interested in being a part of the video team for Felicity'08 should come off to some X room in the mainbuilding. I was there. When Karan started talking, there came up one voice talking about the technicalities of making a video and I thought - "hmm..this guy knows a lot of stuff about making videos, never saw  or heard of him before.. Then I remembered where I have seen him - ofcourse, how can I forget the b-e-a-u-ttttiful dance of yours in first year where we all showered praises for your superb robot dance <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Kidding. You are a great dancer!<br>    Then for the video making, we had these regular meetings and then I think it was through Sashi and Tifozi that we became such great friends that we are right now. It is total fun having him around - he is silent, he does not retort back at my innumerable meaningless absolutely crajjjy comments <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. what more do you want! But these days, he has become quite smart and I will have to sharpen my <i>leofying</i> skills to face you. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br>    Few words about Bee, mind you, only few - He has got a amazingly creative mind <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and an equally sweet heart.. He is level-headed, thoroughly understanding, a great listener and not just he listens to you, he advices you when he thinks there is a wrong from your end.<br>        He dreams big, works towards his dreams so tirelessly that he is one of the source of inspiration for me. He makes me believe that if you dream for achieving something, then you have to give your 100% to it and not leave it as just another dream! I honestly don't think I would have had the guts to start off something as big as Samvedana if I would not have been friends with Bee and Sharat <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Whats more than having people whom you so greatly admire and respect as your closest friends who can thoroughly help you work towards your dream all throughtout? <br>    </b></i></ul><br><br>

The endless <i>sollu</i> sessions in CVIT labs, we go there only under the pretext to work, but no we don't..

<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>     If you are in our wing and you listen to this sexy saxaphone music suddenly out of nowhere, well, you are at Sushma's and thats her ringtone <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Funny thing, she hates her mobile so much for no reason  <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>What can I say about Sush..<br><br>A girl so sensitive that you cannot but pray that she never gets hurt, a girl so caring that you cannot but wish to repay it back, a girl so hardworking, that you cannot but wish her the best in her life and the girl so humble, that you cannot but wish to do something to cheer her up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>     Its because of her <i>keka</i> knowledge in Physics that I managed to pass in that subject in first year <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . We always eat off all the stuff her mom packs for her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . She loves staying at home soo much that you hardly spot her in campus during weekends..Well, you do spot her walking in the night <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif />  <br>       We became so close especially in the third year, we you used sit either in her room or mine and used to go on and on till 4-5 in the morning.. We both being in CVIT, worked together on a couple of projects, and boy, she is so dedicated and good at her work, it really inspires you to work better..<br>      We go on and on talking about the crappiest telugu movies and their titles, not to forget few one liners and songs from the same..She has seen more than her share of telugu movies and does a lot of <i> gyaan baantna</i> on how crappy few of them are... Remember the time when in yuktahaar, you,me,kd and anu sang songs and remembered stupidest dialogues and laughed so hard that we stole the show and brought some life to the soporific, sombre yukhtahaar? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Its fun when we are all together and absolutely boring if even one of us is missing <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>  Finally, Many many congratulations for getting into some of the finest universities and hope you finish off your MS in 1 year and come off and we all stay together.. always..

<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>            Baaaaaaaavaaaaaa... Thats exactly how I greet her - be it in a solemn class, in mess, at 4 AM in the night when she comes back from her looong walks with oh-so-many fans <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .. KD is a clown <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>           I cannot forget the scene we had to do during our ragging incidents. It was then that we spoke for the first time, before that it was just smiles exchange.. She was the guy (as always, it just suits her somehow <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) , and I was this innocent girl being pestered by her.. OMG we both were so terrible at our roles, that seniors actually walked away asking us to atleast attempt to do good <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. I ,ladies and gentlemen was <b>the </b> one to confer the name <b><i>"BAVA"</i></b> to her for a reason of course.  The reason is soo slender and soo delicate that <b>he</b>..oops i mean it cannot be mentioned here <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>        Its great fun when we get together.. We laugh, pull each others' legs, have crushes on others' boy friends and plan to .. well.. we are nice people by heart so nothing wrong in planning and not executing them.. We always had (and have even now <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )a lot of overlap in our crush list.. We fight, we reach an agreement, the list changes and we fight again <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Its fun.. <br><br>        She introduced me to F.R.I.E.N.D.S, 70s show, HIMYM and to all the TV shows which I so ardently follow.. She hates me for barging into her room sometimes without notice.. She hates me for being behind her to switch off the lights and fans but all these extremely minisculer things apart, she is an amaaaaaazing girl to be with and I daresay, I cannot find a <i>bandi</i> who is on par with me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and sometimes I repeat only sometimes (see, I am just being so nice to you!) a little better than me in sarcasm and jokes.. <br><br>        I dream of an apartment full of our gang re..And in that, you are my neighbor.. Your house should be filled with 'teendi' (like that of Monika's) so that I come and eat off all that <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. Food apart, I really wish we all can stay together always.. love you a lot <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[contd...]<br><br>We started talking during Felicity'08's video making..Before that, (atleast I was) completely unaware of his existence. We were in the video team and also in tech team. Thankful to Felicity that I am, it has given me some of my closest chums. Then we started hanging out for start up saturdays and I fail to recollect when we became this close.. All the awesome night outs our 'gangsta' has <i>marofied </i>, my birthday night when we all were sitting at the banyan tree, fighting over constellations,or the recent one - you, me, prateek chicha and bhargova in front of GH - eating biscuits, oranges and talking arbit crap, commenting every couple which crossed our way <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Also, the emosiional chat we had - usurping MSIT's balcony.. Great times, aren't they? <br><br>	Oh, and by the way, he sketches quite well <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> [Thats right, you know what I am talking about - the elephant one :X <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ] Not a big mouth really, but when he is with his closest chums, he goes berserk doing <i>racha racha </i>..  I so much wish we ought to have met earlier and not at the end of our stay in -H <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ..<br><br>	Every single person dreams, dreams of doing what he/she actually likes doing. It is only very very few people who actually take those dreams seriously and push them to a next level and believe me, it takes a lot and lot of perseverance and will power to not give up, to not go where the crowd takes them, to not be just another face in the crowd.. You find that perseverance in Sharat, he never compromises at what he likes or what he wants.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>	I really wish he joins CIQ..We can do total <i>racha</i> there man..Think about all the fun.. Kidding...Muse it is!!! Wishing you loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> Recipe:</b>  3 table spoons of Chandler's sarcasm, 4 table spoons of Joey's cuteness a million table spoons of Ross's sweetness.. Blend all the above ingredients and well.. <b>DO NOT FORGET</b> to sprinkle Phoebe's crazyness all over the dish and bingo!! You have got a "Sharat" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>	Yes, I am quite aware of the countless number of hearts I have broken for being close friends with the one guy on whom "every girl" in our college has a liking <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> This is gonna be a shower of all the ahhsomeness you possess buddy.. He is adorable, cute, he is innocent yet amazingly and unimaginably creative.. Brilliant with literary stuff, something because of which I think we started binding initially and we just keep talking and never stop until somebody around us gets annoyed and asks us to shut up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	A real nice guy, he has got quite a lot of names conferred upon him - sharbat, neuron-pokes,hippo etc.  A complete foodie, teendi potu to be honest, veg, non-veg , mutton chicken, you name it.. If it is teendi, then it has to reach sharbat's mouth. We have a lot of things in common we both loooove chocos, F.R.I.E.N.D.S and fight for Chandler <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. We have overlapping likings - be it music, TV shows , people <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> - he is a victim of all the stoopid homo jokes I crack..But of course, he is God like when it comes to current affairs and all the tech stuff, he always has got something very interesting in his mind to share with me. A good listener and great at sarcasm that I am, we have a total blast every time we talk <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> So very talented and yet so not-assertive about it, man.. you are awe-inspiring <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	Everything he does is so <i>hatke</i>.. Be it the birthday "gift" he gave me or the ahhsome complicated hexagonal thing that I got from him quite recently.. Thanks to my eye injury incident, he now on wheels, bent on finding an eye patch for me to give me a complete pirate look <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>      <i>Mere saamne waali kidki mein, well.. Namrata rehti hai.. Aur koi afsoos nahi hai is baat ka</i> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Been my <i>saamne waali</i> for the past three years.. So totally into sports, WWE, TV shows a complete movie buff she is, yet does great at acads.. We have had a lot of fun - chatting from others' accounts <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , god knows how many lives we have destroyed.. (Remember the series of chats followed by status messages about curly hair,coolest girl, girl next door..what not!!) .. We had fun doing absolutely nothing except for getting scolded by Zulu every time he spotted us, as TAs for CO course..<br><br>        I am surely going to miss all the fun times we have had together - be it driving all the animals which enter your room all the time <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> or the never ending gossip+leg pulling sessions we have sitting at the thresholds of our rooms - me, Nammu, Shals, Sushma, Navs!! She is crystal clear about her plans and priorities - something for which I adore her.. It is unbelievable that we will be parting away so soon <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> , but not without a promise of being as close as we are even in future.. Loads of love. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> (virtual hug <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> )</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The only person with whom I came pretty close emotionally . It rains outside and I think - "Navs wouldn't like it.. She would say - but.. my hair <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". I hear rock music being played somewhere and I think - "Navs would have hated this music <img src=Smileys/1.gif />".. I see Jr. NTR's poster and I think "Navs would have liked this one <img src=Smileys/10.gif />"..<br><br>	 We met each other well before we came to -H at some gathering of Sri chaitanya and man.. how much have we changed since then!! Talking about Navs,welll..she is a great dancer, a brilliant orator, superb at acads (ask her the list of universities who so happily accepted her!).. An ideal child - one about whom all our parents keep dreaming day and night. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	We became quite close at the end of our first semester. I still remember the way we buttified EC ke circuits at the last moment, only to screw the exam even badly <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.. The best would be the night out which me, harshi and navs had for Maths-1 where Navs was sleeping all the time and Harshi and I were scolding, kicking her to get up and atleast listen to what we are studying.. Still, she got an A- <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> .. Those nerdy things apart, we had a lot of fun - gossiping, reading novels <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , fighting Chuck bass v/s stupid Dan., fighting that rock songs are the best <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>	I missed her so much during my 3 months stay in Bangalore last year. I cannot imagine how much I would miss her when she will be going away for two loong years in <b>pursuit of masters </b> <br><br>We are so alike when it comes to few things and so totally different when it comes to few others.. Thanks to her, I have changed a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..Everybody says they have had ups and downs in their relationship..Suprising, yet true, we have never ever had any downs.. A fact which amazes everybody, even us.. With passing time we have become only more closer to each other than we were ever before... God bless our friendship and I only wish it becomes (if possible) even better.<br><br>Wishing that every wish of yours comes true <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Love you and will miss you the most <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[contd...]<br><br>The <i>racha</i> our 'gang' did during all three days of Felicity surpasses all the <i>racha</i> stuff we have ever done before.. The night we all went for Sharat+Sashi's birthday treat which was followed by a mindblowing photo-session of Tifozi and Sashi, the gazal (or was it shayari?) night, where I blowed your mind off with all the stupid phattas possible on planet E and not to forget your birthday celebration and the aftermath <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> - Sweetest memories to remember, aren't they?<br><br>	Put your hands together ladies and gentlemen for this guy - one of my closest friends, a co-founder of Samvedana, a person whose immense support and indelible efforts has helped Samvedana reach where it is now ,a perfect gangsta, a mind so surpassingly creative and a heart so exceedingly sweet, that you can only wonder - what does it take to be someone like him, to whom everybody looks up to and takes notice? So admirable and yet so humble, so winsome and yet so simple, what does it take to be somebody like him?? Honestly, I have no answer..<br><br>	Wishing you truck loads of good luck and happiness throughout <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>"I have no worries about me, its about others that I am worried"..If you hear someone saying this, well..it can only be one person.. Ladies and gentlemen, this guy needs no introduction. He is the first guy in our batch to have a research paper on his name. He is ardently in love with the first love of his life - Electronics - something from which I swore to remain atleast 10 feet away <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Okay, thats just one of the many sides of him.. He was one of the prominent pillars who helped Felicity'08, 'OUR' felicity, to reach to the level it has risen and set a reference standard for the forthcoming batches to follow . He has selflessly shelled out a lot more than his share of time and energy to see that his friends get placed, not once, not for one single time being selfish about his own benefit.<br><br>	Have you ever met somebody, meeting whom, you wished you possessed atleast a minute fraction of that person's good will, you, astounded by his humbleness and selflessness and dedication and wittiness, cannot but pray the best for him.<br><br>              I, known in my own little humble world for being an expert in pulling others' legs, have failed to pick one, I repeat, "ONE" aspect in him so that I can pull his leg on that. Can you 'be' any more nice? But hey, who says I have given up? I am on it! <br><br>	A vegan, foxed by Megan (hey, that rhymes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) a big fan of F1, WWE, gaming, movies, F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Scrubs, Shrubs, grubs, drubs, what not! Loves grey, infact his color palette starts with grey and ends with black. I have never really known him in the first three years of our stay here in IIIT, except for, ofcourse, through blogging.. Oh yes, I am one big fan of his blog, which I wish is revived sometime pretty soon. Its through Sharat and Sashi that we got together and started hanging out.. Then Samvedana happened and when we started working together as a team that I got to know him better. <br>	</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Contd...] <br>There are only two people with whom I can share my thoughts - my dad and Tifozi. Come sorrow, come joy, I have had him by my side. He makes you laugh, he always has some great story to share, he offers his shoulder when you need support, he silently stands by you, only being too happy to help you again and again and again. You should only be extremely lucky to find such a gem in your life, no exaggeration. The immense support I have had from him, instilled confidence in me to start something as big as Samvedana. It makes me ponder, did I do anything in anyway to this person, who has given you so much? I don't have an answer...<br><br>   	Of all the many many things I hate about this month coming to an end, the one which tops the list is Tifozi moving to Bengaluru and me staying at home and working in an office right opposite to that of my Dad's <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>     As i always say to him, the only thing I regret after meeting him is I wish I could have met him earlier <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for every little thing you do. <br><br>[Might write again if I feel I missed something!]<br><br>Khuda Hafiz!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>	Tifozi..I've known him from so long that I actually cannot recollect how it was when we were not friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Okay, I know what you must be thinking - "how mushy..Right?" But honestly.. 5 years is how long we have known each other.. From a  total <i>rajesh kutarpally</i>-ish in our 12th standard <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , to a shy friend in 1st year to a project partner in 2nd year to one of my closest friend from the past 2 years, thats how long we have known each other! True, he isn't much of an extrovert, but equally true, he is the show stealer when he is with his closest friends. A brilliant coder, a  total music freak, a complete foodie, God Tifozi is Prof. PJN's favorite!<br><br>	Of late, he is all geared up for shifting to Bengaluru and pataofy a chick <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I, a professional cupid for many people, offer you my help in <i>pataofy</i>ing, in case you need any.<br><br>	I still remember, one evening in our fourth sem, when we were chatting about something, he listened silently to all that I said, nodded simply and said- "Dekh, all that I can say is, be selfish".. Believe it or not, that actually changed so many things so much that all I can say is it is truly because of him that I am where I am or what I am . In my trek searching for self-identity, Tifozi was my guide and I am truly grateful to him for that. <br><br>	Our friendship has been great inspite of many <i>nazar lagaofy</i>ings <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and I seriously wish it continues to be if not the same, if possible only even better <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. It never effected us when people filled Tifozi's head with some crap about not befriending me or when people stopped talking to me, well, 'coz Tifozi and me were becoming such great friends.. Here, I seriously thank PJN for forcing both of us to work on the same project, much to our denial(well, primarily because our working styles are completely different), because if it is not for him, we wouldn't have slogged for hours in the lab working on our project and thereby become such good friends that we are now. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
