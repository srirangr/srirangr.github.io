<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part2 </b><br>When I first met him in cellar and when he told me he was from Bihar, I never thought we would become so close friends one day... Alok proved all my misconceptions about Bihari wrong <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... Also scar on his face gives him looks of typical Bihari Bhaiyya <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>But as time progressed I found him very friendly... Meri sabse jyada discussions hoti thi is bande se... Koi bhi topic pe hum discuss karte the.... Personal life, social or political issues and even many philosophical points too <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>When I used to be worried about my Google result, Alok used to give me confidence.... Your support was always great buddy and I appreciate that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Ye banda waise kabhi kabhi bahot frustoo ho jaata tha...Ladkiyon ke liyo bahot jyada desperate ho jaata tha... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Bahot baar decide karta hai ki gaaliyan nahi dunga...lekin kabhi nahi chhod paaya...Kya kare bhai log sudharne hi nahi dete... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Iske bhaiya ki shaadi me bahot maje kiye hai isne...

<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part1:</b><br>Alok or I love to call him <i>Alukwa</i> is one of the most helpful and friendly guys in our class.<br><br>He is my one of best friends in IIIT. He shares all things with me and I too share things with him. Whenever I get bored, the first thing I do is to go to his room.... Phir kaphi baatein hoti ho aur saara boredom door ho jata hai... Whenever I am in trouble ,I go to him and he is always there to solve my problem. Let the problem be anything from exam or assignment, attendence or any other things, Alok is ready to help you. <br><br>He is one of the most tolerant guys I have ever seen in my life. We have teased him for almost three years and still continue it, but he never got angry even after we ruined his chances of potential gf <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>He is always ready to entertain the group even at the cost of his own fun. Making fun while teasing others is easy but making fun of yourself to make others laugh is worthy of praise <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He always sings the song of the year (recently it has became song of the month) whenever he gets chance to sing even if people continue to criticise him for that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. <br><br>He is very sincere and hard-working guy <img src=Smileys/77.gif />... He studies each subject with full dedication... He has been teaching us many subjects in the last four years... and also gives us the assignments to copy <img src=Smileys/3.gif />... Thanks for all that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He says he is a public property <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> as his room is.... He is generally not alone in his room.... He will never say NO to a friend for anything... <br><br>Waise ye bahot badaa BC baaz hai.... bas isko kahi pe baithne ko mil jaaye aur bc karne waale log mil jaaaye..... baaki kisi cheez ki jaroorat nahi padegi<br><br>Alok is an integral part of our group... Uske bina group adhura sa lagta hai <img src=Smileys/2.gif />...I can't imagine our group without him... I will really miss you Alok <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part1 </b><br>The only word sufficient to describe him is <b> "BANGA" </b>. The <b>PERFECTIONIST</b> of our batch. He really excells at anything he does. He has tremendous belief that one can do everything in life and excell at it. He is genius.... Think of any good qualities... All those you will find in Banga... Very noble hearted... Has great faith in religion... Very firm on morals and ethics... He is devoted to the noble work for the society....<br><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Itna soft speaking banda maine aaj tak nahi dekha... Very calm and composed <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....Main to sochta hoon kabhi to thoda gusse me aayega...Gussa to dur ki baat hai...Thodasa aggressive bhi nahi hota!!! <br>Lekin iska ek faayada hai- Kisi ko bhi pata sakta hai apni baaton se <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Waise ye batane ki jaroorat nahi hai ki Banga aajkal college me nahi rehta <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Though I miss you a lottttt (really a lot) in the campus and so the group, I think you are doing the noble work and you enjoy it. If somebody will ask me what is banga's biggest quality? I would say - "Listening to the heart and not caring what others will say".  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Padhai likhai me to bhai Banga bahot bada bond hai... Grades se to usko bahot jyada pyaar hai... CGPA aise hi thodi na banati hai phir <img src=Smileys/3.gif />... Lekin jab grade kharab aata ho to kaphi dukhi hota hai... Discrete maths me 'B' aane ke kaaran bechara kitne dino tak sadme tha... <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <br><br>Banga ne mujhe bahot subjects padhaye hai... Banda bahot cool tareeke se padhata hai... Saamne wala kitna bhi dumb question pooche Banga har cheez ki bade aaram se aur pyar se samajhata hai... Great patience indeed <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>Bahot careless attitude hai bande me...Kahi pe bhi koi bhi cheez chhod ke jaata hai... <br><br>In first year he was very very innocent... Kabeer used to pull his leg a lot... used to take photo while sleeping... Ye bechara padh bhi nahi paata tha... Raat me kabeer sone ke baad Table lamp laga ke padhta rehta tha...<br><br>Iske room mates ne isko bahot tang kiya hai...Baba bhi kuch kam nahi hai... Aur maine bhi unka saath diya hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Hope you never take such tension in your life in future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Ek baar first year me banga jawahar ka assignment chhodke ghar gaya tha...Waha se bande ne mail kiya code wo bhi bina koi indentation aur spaces ke bina <img src=Smileys/14.gif />....Kabeer aur God ke bachche ke josh mein hamesha ghar jaane ki lagi rehti thi.... Zulu sir ne bhi banga ki kaphi liyi hai...Sir usko hamesha bolte hai jab dekho amritsir chale jaate hoo <img src=Smileys/3.gif />...   <br><br>Class me iske naam se humne itna chillaya hai...First sem se hi iska naam sabko pata chal gaya <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.... Alok ke naam chillane se pehle sab log Banga Banga hi chillate rehte the...<br><br>Log isko sirf Banga ke hi naam se jaante hai... Ek baar kuch kaam se isne charan ko phone kiya tha...Banga bolta hai- Main Randeep Singh bol raha hoon...Charan bechara pehchaan hi nahi paaya, wo poocha kaun Randeep.... Banga laga raha- Arey Randeep Singh bol raha hoon...Do teen baar yahi hua phir bhi wo nahi pehchana... Phir finally Banga bola- Arey main BANGA bol raha hoon....Wo turant samajh gaya...

For those who dont know its Pic on Pankaj's B'day n sachin crying for cake <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Its really worth <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.... Hope chacha ye picture change nahi karenge (abhi 4-5 mahino me to nahi kiyi.... so i am confident he will not... )<br><br>Waise ye ladkiyon ko jyada bhaav nahi deta.... kaphi iske peeche padi hai lekin hamara bond unse peecha chhodata rahta hain <img src=Smileys/5.gif />.<br><br>I m feeling lucky <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> that you were my room partner. Will miss you very much. Dont forget me after going to Bangalore. Best wishes for your future.<br><br><b>Most memorable moment:</b> The night we roamed in Hyderabad on bikes after watching a movie<br><b>Will miss u 4:</b> Smile on ur face, BC , lazy attitude and for all flash games we played together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><b>Song 4 u:</b> Hum to bhai jaise hai waise rahenge<br><b>Message 4 u:</b> Never loose your cool nature<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> Part2 </b><br><br>When I first met him, my first impression was he was very sincere guy. He used to talk about how much he used to study about JEE, His success in National Olympiads, NTSE.... But whoooosh....Dheere dheere usne apne patte fenkne shuru kiye...... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>We used to go to buy books on the first day of every semester. As if it was a competition to buy the books before all.... and then that was the only day in whole semester he loved those books <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Ek baar to utni saari kitaabe leke hum zoo dekhne chale gaye the... <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>I still remember how we used to do C programming assignments.... One time on the last day of assignment we were so frustrated and we left almost 50% of the work undone and watched three movies. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We used to go out so many times searching for laptop and all those outings were memorable. Especially the one in which we went to Universal, CCD, Pizza Hut on same day. we talked about so many things that time... n we became close friends... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He bought the first laptop in the cellar before ITWS end-sem exam... Then new era at the cellar started.... Chatting, Social networking on hi5, Orkut....Watching movies... Playing games.... Very few people might be knowing... He also loves to play Age of Empires... We used to go to UG4 lab... Arrange PCs and Play Age <br><br>You may think he is never serious at studies.... But i know how seriously he used to prepare for CAT.... He is damn intelligent... But just by bad luck he lost chance at IIMs even after scoring very high. Dont worry dude you deserve better than IIMs. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Loves to do BC and outings.... and never misses chance irritating and pulling legs of his room partner.... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>We will always be friends. Thanks for being such an awesome friend.... Will miss you very much<br><br><b>Most Memorable Event:</b> CCD and Pizza hut outing... and movies watched in Akansh Bhaiya's room<br><b>Character I relate to you:</b> Barney Stinson of Himym<br><b>Message for you:</b> Be careful when you are excited <br><b>Will miss you for:</b> Your passion and adventure<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The most energetic and passionate boy of our batch...Known as 'God ka bachcha'... He pours energy in the group even after the night out... I have never seen him dull....Really an Uber cooool personality <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He is an amazing story teller.... Great imagination.... Mirch masale bina koi baat nahi bata sakata.... Once he told a story in the group and I couldn't believe when he told me you was also there when it happened <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ..... Saini has his version of story that will be dramatically different from others... But then what is fun in the life without some spices <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He dreams of becoming Movie director or story writer. Bollywood awaits you dude! They really need talent like yours <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>He has tons of girlfriends. So many girls are crazzzzy about him. Really great at doing magic on girls <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ... But never tells how he does that <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br><br>Apart from gals he is very crazy about bikes and Cars.... I loved to talk with this guys about BMWs, Merc, Toyota, Honda, Scorpio, Safari for long time and never get bored. Hope you buy Corolla Altis soon .... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>First year we watched Matrix, LOTR series on Akansh Bhaiyya's room. He can watch these movies infinite number of times. He has by hearted all the dialogs of Matrix. And while watching movie he dips in the imagination world (in the character of Neo). His passion or spark while watching these movies is amazing. His email id- matrix_trap accentuates this fact...<br><br>Every time I want to see some movie or start watching new TV series or read a novel, I used to go to him and take his suggestion. Whenever I watched any TV episodes of GG, Himym, tbbt, the OC or movies with this guy, I loved them more.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Last but not least -  this guy is LEGEN (wait for it)................. DARY!!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul's testi in his own style....<br>Bhai Guitar bajata hai, Californicashion <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> gaata hai, Dholak bajata hai, Khudka rock band hai, Basketball khelta hai, Code bhi karta hai, Entreprenuer hai, CapitalIq me job karta hai, 10 logon ko entertain kar sakta hai, Creative hai, ladkiyaan bhi hai peeche phir bhi bandaa Down to earth hai.... <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>Really this guy's aura will make you feel inferior, Such an all round performer! His progress from Reewa (dont know spelling <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) to Californicashion n CapitalIQ is stupendous <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. You will never get bored in his company, very creative and very good in making jokes except few PJs...The experience of bc with Atul is always FUN at its extreme. Though I came close to him only in final year...I will miss him very much!<br>All the very best for your future life.</b></i></ul><br><br>
