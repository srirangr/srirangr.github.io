<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Raul, the other person who helped me pass courses, apart from Atul. Rahul and Atul were famous in GHEB for taking classes and doing assignments in first year, and I benefitted from their efforts! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>One day I asked Rahul, in 4th year, as to why he stopped working hard as he used to do in 1st and 2nd year. He said that he wanted to enjoy the last year after working hard for last 3 years. But perhaps some people's destiny is to work hard, so he's still working hard, taking classes and helping people like me to pass courses.<br>Although he has a peculiar habit of finding the ending of a movie, so as to ensure nothing bad happens in the end, he did suggest me some nice romantic movies, most of which I didn't see though! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I still remember the day we saw<br>Serendipity together, he saw that movie with me for some Nth time only because it had a happy ending!<br>He always accuses me of not keeping my room clean and makes sure his room remains clean and ventilated. Its because of him that I have seen some really good looking faces on internet and in social networking sites. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He calls me Sindhi but has a habit of keeping accounts till the last Rupee... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He had this peculiar habit in 1st two years of sitting beside his room's window and asking any of the passers by he knew to get him something from the coffee shop conveniently visible from his room's window, stretching his arm out of the window with the money between his fingers. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (ok the last part is kind of imagined !!)<br>We have many times talked for hours regarding our future plans and life in general. He says he's very conservative and would only marry in his caste, but I have a hunch that he might compromise when the time comes. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his sincerity, and taking time out to help others. What I would never take from him is watching the end of the movie before watching the rest of the movie! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Raole,among sincerest and most hard working guys of the batch. He always keeps on smiling, saare photo mein almost same hi pose rehte hain iske <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> His talent was known in first few classes, he showed everyone how much he knew and how much he knows about the computers and all. I think everyone wonders how he knew so much <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> He has his computer beside mine. He keeps his damn hard like xp installation ke <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br>  Shopping freak hain, season discounts ke samay, pta nahin kitne saare kapde leta hain , he has great dressing sense <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Has special concern for his health, roz 5-6 km dhodta hain <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> even friends se bhi gentleman ki tarah baat karta hain , calmly and slowly <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Loves going out, always ready to try new things, Indijoe ki party you gave was just awesome <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.

Ladkiyon ke mamle mein toh GOD hain , yane ki koi bhi ladki ki info. chahiye ho, just give him name, location and he will search the details <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> We are placed in the same company. During placements, although mere interview theek gaye the but I was like ki Tenany ke saamne kahan hoga mera , luckily they took both of us <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . As we are placed together I guess, we will nurture our friendship further.

<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Rahul. Aah the typical studious guy. Rite from first year. When i and nauty used to discuss how to approach the assignment. This guy used to do it would toil for hours and do it on his own <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif />.<br> <br>If he ever had a doubt he would just ask how to approach but never say the words "Abe code ho to dede" <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Hehe keeps changing his orkut names Raul,Rahool aur pata nahin kya kya. Anyways i like his discipline and honesty a lot. Wish you all the best Raoul.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>It was the first day of classes. I entered the class and looked at formal clothes and eager eyes. The attendance was complete, and a smart professor with a moustache entered the class. He claimed to be teaching something called IT workshop. He spoke about a few things, and then put question to the class. A hand went up, and lo- it was the right answer. It kept happening over and again, throughout the semester. Everyone knows who it was <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>I will always remember Tenany as someone who has clear cut goals and knows exactly what he wants to do. Very few of us can claim the same today. But not so with him. Be it an MBA, or a Salman Khan movie or staying in NBH or working out to get rid of the tummy; he is quite clear about stuff.<br><br>Tenany is one person who always calls me "Karan" and not "Maroo". And I really love it. Even though I do not call him "Rahul" myself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Well, jokes apart, hes one guy who is very hard working- a true grafter, which comes with the clarity of thought and coordination with deed. Combine it with his intelligence, and you have one of the better jobs in his kitty. <br><br>He has been a lot of help to me, especially in the ITWS 3 project and Venky's courses. He taught me a lot of PHP during the itws project. He also has always been ready to lend me Venky's notes. Thanks a lot for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I owe you one. Unfortunately, we could not do our BTP together, as I was very busy with other stuff in third year, and could not commit myself to a project under Rawat. I'm sure you'd understand <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>All the best buddy, any help and you can count on me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav memory: Help for the itws project.<br>Message for him: You could be more flexible.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>     [Part-3]<br>Movies:<br>He has loads of conditions for movies. Here is few of them with respective genres:<br><br>All:<br>- Happy Ending<br>- Heroes/Heroines shouldnt die<br>- No NC-17 content.<br><br>Romance/Comedy || Comedy || Romance:<br>- Preferably Girl dominated movies.<br>- No serious villians.<br><br>Horror:<br>- Ghost is a must. [ He hates "The others" and hates me too for suggesting it to him.]<br>- Story and Logic is not important.<br>- It should be damn scary.<br><br>He rarely watches Thriller, Action, Scifi stuff but if he is watching it with interest then there is more to it then what we think it is. He also watches telugu movies even if I advice him to stop watching them and make use of time more optimally.[btw he is a Brahmanandam fan]<br><br>Trivia:<br>Did you know that half of his hard disk space ie 20 GB is consumed by You-Know-What. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Hoping that we remain very good friends for a long time ... I end this testimonial.All the best for you future and DO keep in touch bcoz I have a tendency not to.<br><br>Note: This happens to be my first testimonial for a friend and I m not proofreading it so there might be mistakes at some places which are best ignored.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[Part-2]<br>Health/Hygiene/Fitness:<br>Rahuls room is an epitome of cleanliness. He gets his room cleaned almost twice a week while I do it once in 2 months even after being his neighbour. I remember how he used to scold Atul for keeping his room as bad as possible. He used to complain about my room too but he got used to it.<br>	He is very selective about food and prefers his food to be ultra hygiene. He definitely is the person with least number of visits to the canteen during these 4 years while I must have been the paid highest number of visits to the canteen.<br>	As far as fitness is concerned, He has been a consistent jogger since 2nd year and easily cover long distances which I wouldnt dare to dream about too. He hasnt played much sports in college but definitely has a thing for badminton.<br><br>Chicks and Clicks:<br>Rahul is the human chickipedia of the our batch. You can find Rahul in all social networking sites ... he joins them just for the sake of finding an awesome girlfriend but to his vain ... all his requests get rejected (dont give up dude .... u will be successful on some occasion <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Apart from this, he has a thing of cute actresses and loves to watch their movies (btw he is a very big fan of lindsay or was). He has a huge list of cute girls from various fields ... be it sports, foreign movies and what not.<br>	He likes being clicked on cameras/mobiles. You can see him run for the sake of being photographed and is very proud of his "Genuine Smile"(TM). Sometimes he has been shot in some controversial poses of which few people would know about and I am sure the rest will come to know soon.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>		[Part - 1]<br><br>I wasnt familier with Rahul during my 1st year ,I only had the idea that he was dedicated towards Studies and was pretty good at it. It was during my Second year that I became friends with him which then flourished in 3rd year when Rahul shifted his room to NBH 3rd floor on advice of Kharkwal. Now we are neighbours and very good friends. <br><br>Here are a few points worth mentioning about Rahul:<br><br>Studies:<br>Raol definitely is one of the most disciplined students I have ever seen. He has a thing of acad work and keeps doing all of them in time. He has a tendency to listen in almost all classes and which is really rare in our batch. There are times when he becomes a bit careless and causes humour in the class itself (remember puck-puck incident in CL-1). Sometimes he feels depressed that even after working so hard he doesnt manage to get a GPA above that of people who havent worked hard for it but now he has gone over it and no more compares himself with others.<br><br>Hisaab/Loan/MoneySpending:<br>He is one of those people who checks out all available options and tries to get maximum from the money he spends without going down in terms of quality. He has an interest for expensive, stylish, and branded accessories and clothing.<br>	He does the hisaab whenever I, Kharkwal, and he go out for dinner. I and kharkwal dont bother to check the bills and his hisaab because he calculates them with accuracy until 2 decimal digits which he rounds off later in an unconventional way which he only knows. When he does hisaab in his mind, he does mistakes so we always to do the hisaab in his room with a free mind.<br>	Being in debt of him would be the last thing u would ever want to do. As long as u r in debt of him ... u will have dark days which many people say is because of Rahul's Black Magic ability (Do teach me a few tricks in summer <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>Health/Hygiene/Fitness:<br>Rahuls room is an epitome of cleanliness.
