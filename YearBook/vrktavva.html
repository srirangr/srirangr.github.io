He is such a dedicated, serious, hard working person that if you see him concentrating on something, you'll bet your life on him having never smiled his entire life.<br><br>And then, you see him flash that broad cheerful grin, that bright colgate smile, <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and you think you are looking at a totally different person. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>And then the mimicry artist that he is, a brilliant actor and extremely energetic and expressive dancer, he is very creative, sincere, and original in whatever he does. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>A very dedicated performer, and very sincere and hard-working student, <img src=Smileys/26.gif />, Rajesh is someone who goes to the root of a concept in trying to understand it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And that with all the humility, simplicity and willingness to help everyone who needs him, makes Rajesh an extraordinary human being <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Looking forward to teaming up with you for some more creative fun filled stage performances like the one we did in Felicity '07 <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best in life <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.

<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I used to think Tavva was very proud and won't talk to others who doesn't have gud CGPA <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Sorry Tavva <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> but when I talked to him, realized the truth. So never judge anyone by looks <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>Nice guy but sometimes lost in his own world... sits in the lab and keeps on thinking <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> about concepts related to his study and initially(we worked in the same lab) I cudn't understand whether he is sleeping or thinking <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>Works very hard and helps others. I saw only Tavva to regularly visit many restaurants around the city with his prof <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> All da best Tavva for ur thesis and enjoy all the parties with ur guide <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Except that there is no change in this guy. The same studious nature, the same dedication to studies, the same set of friends (I mean constant set of friends who are unique in their own way). <br><br>Was invisible in the campus for an year or so but yeah I can see you these days buddy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Is very very very studious and I hope he would write on of the best thesis ever written in IIIT.<br><br>All the very best ra,<br>stay in touch and appudappudu kanipistoo undu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers,<br>rohit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Tavva ... probably the shortest guy in the batch. But as they say, good things come in small packets. I'll remember you for the following things dude:<br><br>- The doubts you ask in class <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>- Your dance <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>- The way you do Rajashekhar step. Awesome. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>- Your stage presence <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>- Titanic comedy in 22tango <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>- Your patience<br>- courage to do MS under Kamal sir. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br>- Your charm (for which almost every girl in our batch is <b> fida</b> on you <img src=Smileys/6.gif />) <br>- Last but not the least your energy.

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He's a pro at teaching. He took a lecture for me and many others on Theory of society, history and justice. Everyone understood whatever he said and<br>explained. He helped us attempt questions in the exam! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He's a pro at dancing. He is equally awesome in both western and classical dances. His body is quite flexible and he moves his body while dancing with such ease as if it was as simple as walking or talking!<br>I still remember his act of some minister which he often performed in class and in other occasions on request of others, and the way he did it, always made everyone laugh, including the faculty member present there!<br>I also like his soft spoken nature and patience.<br>What I would like to take from him is his special skill of teaching things with such ease that anyone can understand it, and taking out some time to help others as well.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

He is rare combination of being both disciplined and dedicated. A combination you will find in a very few people.  <br><br>He is really helpful. Many a times when we needed to understand the subject we used to go to Rajesh and he would clarify it. He is always enthusiastic be it studying software engineering, teaching <b>software engineering</b>, dancing, and whatever he does. <br><br><br>I get a feeling that he is "A perfectionist always trying to strive for perfection in everything he does ". <br><br>Quote for you: "This is the very perfection of a man, to find out his own imperfections."<br><br>I wish you will complete your thesis asap.

Once or twice i replied back in friendly manner and believe me after that his face was worth noticing <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> !! <br>He is a good mimic too.
