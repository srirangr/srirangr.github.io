<b><a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Paro bhai, kya fotu lagayi hai yar!!! <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Abhinav bhai is a very funny person, always ready to crack subtle jokes on whatever you say, the best part being, he would do so in the most serious of situations - before exams and deadlines.. and so his jokes always had a relaxing effect at a very correct time. Thanx ra!!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Par, agar mera gana interrupt karte hue koi joke maara aagey se to <b>moo tod dunga</b> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br><br>Naachte hue dekha kabhi isko? The paro dance - bilkul bindaas ho ke dil khol ke naachta hai chora <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Aur haan sirf hansi mazaak hi nahi, koi serious issue ho to gambheerta se sochta bhi hai aur suggest bhi karta hai kya kiya jaye <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Aur kushti? Kushti mein to iski itni pitayi ki hai maine, aur kabhi kabhi dhokhe se isne bhi, ki jiska koi jawaab nahi!!! <br><br>Aur coffee peeney ke liye bulata hai to naa nahi bola jaata. Itne pyar se baat karta hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Bada mehanati aur ziddi ladka hai.. jo thaan liya mann mein kar ke hi dum liya <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>To, fir Paro bhai, hamesha aise hi khilkhilate, muskurate, rehna aur milne bhi aate rehna <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>May you be successful, keep dancing, keep fighting, keep working hard and keep enjoying life the way you have done so far!!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>" machane walon ko machane ka bahana chahiye ..<br>chandramukhi ho ya <b>paro</b> koi fark nahi hai yaaro ..<br>yaaro ko to jeene ka bahana chahiye .. "<br><br>These are the lines from one of Kishore's songs which also tops my fav oldies list. Whenever I see Paro, I am reminded of this song.<br><br>Well, I seldom had any interaction with this guy in these 4 years but one thing is for sure, his instantaneous jiokes and creativity is something appreciable <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. One of his most importnat qualities is that he's sensible enough to spread gandagi at right places <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and doeen;t make chaos.<br><br>Paro bhai tum rocking ho aur aise hi SRK style me rockng karte hue sabke dil jeet-te rehna ...<br><br>All the best for your future buddy<br><br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Paro aka Saarukh, he does give a first impression of a stud but the impression soon fades away when one starts to know the real Paro. I find him quite lazy at times, but that doesn;t stop him from going to the coffee shop.<br>He is someone who likes to live life to the fullest.<br>His short story, 'Green Minds' was totally impressive, I must confess I wasn't expecting such an awesome story from him! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I even decided I'd have him as my partner for writing stories. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>During last summer I joined him and Alok and Atul in their entrepreneurship venture, don't know why, so we had to prepare a report and Paro and I decided to write it after dinner, and when we went to his room (in cellar) to write it, he started videos of hindi songs... I said ki pehle report kar lete hain, lekin paro ko masti chadi hui thi, aur 1 ghante tak hum bas wo gaane dekhte<br>rahe <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>In third year, while staying in 3rd floor, I sometimes went to his room and we talked about our bygone days, it was fun!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhinav Parashar aka Paro aka Saruk<br><br>Isse interaction hua tha mera equitypulse aur SE ke time. Kitna bada frustoo hai saale tu. Equity ke time arbit colleges ki arbit bandiyon ko pakad pakad kar scrap kar raha tha ki hamara equity khelo. Haalanki equity to sirf bahana tha. Apna Saruk bahut hi hardworking banda hai when it comes to work as I have seen in equity and SE. Is bande ko alag alag poses mein photographs khichwane ka bahut shauk hai. Hamesha tuk mein baat karta hai. SE presentation ke time maine dekha ki ye achanak se kuch bhi gaana shuru kar deta tha like "Jungle jungle baat chali hai" .... aur aisi ultimate tune mein gaata tha ki mazaa aa jata tha. BC karne mein to maahir hai hi. UG4 mailing list par ye log jo bc karte hain ki kya hi batayein. Paro bhai, touch mein rehna. Hyd mein hi ho tum to. All the best for your future. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>

He has worked sincerely towards the projects to make his dream come true....His dedication to his goal is worth praising <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.... I wish your dream comes in reality soon....<br><br>Waise pehle main Paro ko jyada nahi jaanta tha... Alok ke kaaran hum phir ache dost ban gaye... <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Equitypulse ke waqt kaphi der humne saath me kaam kiya tha...<br><br>Isko attendance, assignments ki kaphi chinta lagi rehti hai...Khud nahi jyata lekin mere peeche pada rehta hai- class jaake proxy maar diyo yaar, assignment kar de yaar<br><br>Jab iski placement nahi ho rahi thi to kaphi bura lag raha tha...Lekin finally jab iski achi job lag gayi to bahot achcha laga...Iski 'Mehnat rang layi' <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Phatton ka baadshaha hai... Jab iska mood hota to bhai kya ek se badhkar ek phatte maarta hai... Aur gandagi ka bhi shahenshaha hai, lekin ab iske chele atul aur alok isse bhi aage nikal gaye hai... Agar mai ab wo kisse sunane lag jaayu to bhai yearbook kharab ho jaayegi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Atul, Alok , Paro aur maine Alok ke room pe ya phir coffee shop pe bahot bc maari hai... Placements ke waqt specially <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... His knowledge about web technologies is excellent... Whenever we need any help about AJAX, PHP or Javascript we go to Paro and he always helps us with that... Thanks for that yaar <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... <br><br>Hum to hyderabad me hi rehne waale to milte rehna....

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Abhinav Parashar aka Paro aka Sarukh</u><br><br>Ye awesome banda hai bhai, same floor pe reh raha hai pichle ek saal se. BUT isko ek baar bhi apne floor pe nahin dekha hai maine... Everytime I have met or seen him over the last 8-10 months, it has either been the coffee shop or on the road leading from OBH to Coffee Shop. If somebody obeserves him over the duration of a day, the person can easily conclude that it is the coffee shop where he lives and must be convinced into believing that he comes to the room just to complete the daily rituals (talking about which seems to be the second mission of his life).<br><br>For the first three years of my B.Tech, paro was just another guy with whom I shared a casual relation, aate jate kabhi milte the to Hi-Hello ho jati thi, thoda sa leofying over Sarukh Khan or that Tom Cruise look he sported. NBH mein bhi 3rd floor pe rehta tha to batcheet zyada nahin hoti thi :|<br><br>He is one of those guys, who I would have loved to know more and yet due to all the factors being in play, this could never happen. I am left to listen to all his <b>gandh and cheap</b> stories from others' mouths. Would have loved to hear all this from the great master himself.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhinav aka Paro or SRK ... everyone thinks of Mehta when abhinav name is called <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... his permanent name is Paro know. If you want to learn new styles for photo shoot then he is the right person .. and he will guide you perfectly <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> as you can see from his pic <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>In 1st year, we spent alot of time together as we were of the same type .. we didn't like to speak alot .. kind of reserved nature ... so we became very good friends. He is very hard working person and is always a source of inspiration for me. In 1st sem, he faced a lot of problem because of english as he was from a hindi medium. But he worked really hard and removed that barrier <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is the kind of person who never gives up untill the thing is over <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. That quality has always inspired me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>In studies, I have taken most of the course with him .. even a few project. He use to take a lot of tension regarding the courses ... assignments and exams. Even in the last sem he is taking a lot of tension abt the LP course <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>His favourite hobby is photo session ... you can always see him in different posses when someone is taking a snap. Whenever I use to open the photo gallery of my mobile phone, I use to find only Paro's photographs in that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Till now he speaks very less so rearly take part in BC sessions. He is addicted to tea ... you can see him at CS in the morning, noon, evening and night till the CS closes .. taking a sip of tea <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>He is really good at chatting ... don't know how he made a girl fall in Love with her by chatting only <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. A few girls in career point were also impressed from him because he was topper thr and got one of the top ranks in AIEEE <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>We are in Hyderabad so we will be in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Best of Luck for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhinav Parashar, tak tak tak, Umra 19 saal, tak tak tak, Gaon Deeg, tak tak tak, Career Point Rank 1,  tak tak tak, All Kota open test Rank 1, tak tak tak, Narayana Rank 1, newspaper mai bhi bada sa naam chhapa tha, AIR 149. Ek saal tak Kota mai sirf Abhinav parashar ka naam suna tha lekin shakal nahin dekhi thi. Fir ek din 18th July,05 achanak mess mai kisi ne bataya meet abhinav parashar. It was like dream come true. But he was quite reserve in the early days and i still remember when i used to meet him in NBH mess and ask him to mingle up with others. In my first semester i very often visited 3rd floor to see Pankaj and just say hi to him. Jab hum aapas mai ghulne lage to pata chala isse ek mirgi se bhi bada rog hai and wo hai chaay mania. Ek time to aisa ho gaya ki he pulled my shirt so badly in order to drag me to Coffee shop that I lost my temper. Then I started leofying him saying " yaar tu mera room knock kardiya kar mai darwaze ke niche se chaar rupaye fak diya karunga aur mere naam ki chaay kharid ke pi liyo" lekin bhagwan ke liye mujhe maaf karde. Lekin fir room se coffee shop and coffee shop se room ke janjal mai aise fase ki bas aajtak inka pichha nahi chhuta. <br>Jab tak hum 5th semester pahunche we had come very close to each other. We almost shared all our secrets to each other. Ittafak se, iske kuch kota ke kuch khaas frnd hamare common frnd nikale <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . bas aise hi samay nikalta raha aur fir aaya placements. . We had spent hours together preparing for placements. Tab maine ise ache se jana. He is very helping in nature, trustworthy, feel good gesture, optimistic, smart, and laborious. Man I know I could not do justice to you as there is much more to write about you.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Paro or Abhinav or Parashar formed an one fourth of the quatret at Bangalore during summer 2008 (Pagare, Khatri and me being the others). And no <br>exhaggeration, those were some of the best days we've had! Before the Microsoft internship, I only knew him as the guy who kept visiting Vig's room in cellar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But we hit off quite well in Bangalore.<br><br>Our day would start with breakfast, and you cant help but notice the kind of passion he has for food. He loves eating, and was the one who'd finish all the biscuits in our section of the office! I'd certainly advice a woman that the way to his heart is through his stomach <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Offer him a buffet, and he'd love it! We'd reach work, where we would push off for foosball. Foosball, well we loved playing it.. It was our most important activity everyday <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Khatri and Paro would be in one team; Pagare and me in the other - they would beat us 7 out of 10 times! But we still had the verve (especially Pagare) to keep <br>challenging them for a scoop of the 'Gudbud' sundae icecream <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The next thing you'd notice about Paro is when you hit the gym. He is obsessed with looking good and getting photographs clicked. I even had to click a pic of his in the changing room! He loves putting up new pics on orkut <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Ask him about his innumerable <br>rendevous with chicks <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Other lovely memories include the Ooty trip (remember the cut); leofying him left, right and center (Khatri's fav victime) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ; Wonderlaa; shopping together..<br><br>A prominent part of him is the independence and clarity about what he wants to do. He always had a lot of passion for his ideas, and kept talking to people about executing the business. He has the passion to do his thing- which is the first and the most important recipe for success. Hes also very hardworking- something which I've seen both at Microsoft and college (placements). He had the tenacity to keep going inspite of the setbacks of the first few days and hats off to him for that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Hes also a keen learner at every stage, which is very heartening to see.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Very few person are in this world, who are same inside-out. Paro is one of them. We were in diff section in first year, and it was at the end of the first year we talked for the first time in relation to our scholarship from CBSE, which we din get. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>The very first impression was that this guy is pure and friendly like me. Again the same thing. All the friends I made were either section apart or hostel apart. It was in 3rd year we started hanging out quite more often and our friendship grew more deeper. uske baad toh phir BTP partner ban gaye. thanks to him, that mera BTP complete ho gaya in which I meagerly worked. <br>I think over the time Paro has evolved. From a reserved guy he has become now a cool, more fun loving, and I-don't-give-a-damn kinda person.Ab toh SRK ban gaya hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Jolly gud Paro.Last year toh kafi time spent kiya humne. wo placement ki preparations, Coffeeshop k round marna atleast 4 times a day, sath mein movies dekhna.<br>par janab ek mod aur aa gaya is dosti mein. We going to become city apart, but thats only physical distances. Aage bhi mil ke aish karenge.<br><br><b> Strong points : Determined and dedicated, honest and true to the def of friend.<br>Not so weak point : People may exploit his soft nature.<br>My advice : Be the same...U will rock.<br>Song 4 u : I am the best..(SRK wala <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br>... to be continued.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhinav '<b>bhole to</b>' Paro aka S..S..S..Saarukh <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> is a hard working guy. He is very dedicated and sincere towards his work. From the 1st sem till date, he is concerned about his studies, although CG itni achchhi nahi hai, but believe me he has more technical knowledge than anyone else. By nature he is a shy person, who knows himself well under his limitations. <br>Photos khichaane ka bhi bada shauk hai ise, always ready with a new pose.<br><i>A brief Incident</i>Once, Gupta (of course, Nitin) has to give him 5 Rs., gupta nahi de raha tha. He took gupta's facewash, used it for 5 days and returned it back to him. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>Still, a very friendly person indeed. All the best paro for your future.

<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhinav Parashar aka Paro aka Srk is one of the most friendly person of our batch. He looves camera and would do almost anything for a pic <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. A rare person who is actually good at heart. Had a lot of fun with him at Goa. Total mastiKhor and a stud when it comes to girls. I have seen him not getting bogged down by placments and coming back strong. I admire him for that. I think what's common among is that we both dream big and while doing so have a sense of responsibility.<br>Will Miss U for:- bakar , masti and your spooky stories <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Most Memorable moment:- Goa Trip<br>Msg for U: Keep in touch<br>Song for u:- yahoo...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
