<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Popularly known as Bhalu among his friends, Himank and I have sadly not interacted much, except for few times. I consider him as one of the most consistent bloggers among the good ones I've met and read about. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He's quite an extrovert guy and likes to have fun. The night in club 8, he was so drunk, he was shaking to and fro while paying the bills. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He likes to do a lot of masti and BC.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=yvsandeep.html>Sandeep Y V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Himank..... i think this guy is one of the most fun loving guys of our batch... well he can do non-stop BC all night (a trait which we seem to share... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )... <br><br>first time met him at the back of B section in CO class, still remember that to this day... Whenever I see him he is always teasing some one with a smile on his face...<br><br>He is also very talented... still remember his mock scores. He never used to attend them regularly but when he attended them, boy did he rock them....<br><br>He writes blogs very well and always ends his blogs with a song for the day.. I think he never missed it... IMO some blogs deserve to be published as newspaper articles... <img src=Smileys/77.gif />...<br><br>All the best dude.. do remember me and keep in touch... <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Himank the most active and talkative guy of our batch. How can you talk so much. I wonder about it <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br><br>He used to pull my legs a lot. Always enjoyed your company dude. <br><br>We used to comment RG (rohit) a lot. It is in 2nd and 3rd year where we became very close. We are in the same lab. I was always wondered by his ability to manage people even if he has nothing to show. Great dude. But I know his kasi too.. If he likes the work, he works a lot. He proved it to me in ITWS project.<br><br>His jokes are awesome. He can crack jokes on anyone and on annnyyy subject. you know what I mean <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I missed him in 4th year. He was very busy in his cat preparation. But I still read your blogs dude. They are amazing.<br><br>Wish I come to place where you are there to get back old days. <br><br>All the best. I hope things go as you have thought. miss you<br><br>bye <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br>Whenever I get nostalgic about our college times, your blog will be one thing I'll be referring to. Didn't like it at first, but now I think it totally reflects our daily lives at the college, and I am in love with it now. <br><br>Kudos to you. I can never forget you and let's hope we keep seeing more of each other in the future!<br><br><b>Fav. Memory:</b> The two incidences described above, reading and commenting on your blog.<br><b>Nickname for you:</b> Bhaloooo! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bhaloo Bhaiya!<br><br>Kaya gazab ka banda hai. Ekdum bindaas! Matlab jitna hona chahiye utna. BC, BC and more BC. Not just in terms of time, but in terms of intensity, too. Ek saath 4-5 type ki BC. Ek blog likhte huye, el blogs padthe huye, 3-4 logon se chat karte huye, aur 3-4 logon se baatein karte huye... add to that ki koi badhiya sa Beatles baj raha ho... sab ka sab ek saath. Bhayanak wala BCbaaj aadmi hai bhai. Add to that ki he's one of the hardest drinkers of the batch, one of the biggest suttebaaj, Farewell par bhi shave na karne wala, and the one guy jo ki apne room mein alarm baja ke poori wing ko jaga de, par khud na jagey <img src=Smileys/77.gif />... and you get the picture.<br><br>Of course you cannot judge merely on these things, for Himank is also one of the sharpest and the most energetic guys I have ever seen. Look at his academic and other achievements. First year mein Workspace mein awesome coding karta tha bhai! Fat leti thi. He's also a big fan of Hindi like me, and a fellow blogger and we also share similar musical tastes. We also share some similar funde about life - Both long for the shaant, peaceful types life, something which is difficult to get in the line we have chosen to be in. He has a good circle among the fairer sex, too, so that must mean that he knows how to behave himself properly, although I see few examples of that in our daily interaction together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Have been in a few incidences with him that fall outside the purview of the daily discussion and BC. I can never, ever forget the time when the four if us reached some other place from his room. It was the first time for him, and the absolute drama he did after that, well, I would pay a thousand bucks to see such drama again <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Another was this Felicity '09 Rock show, when we devised the famous Law of ours. Of course the others won't understand, they can never reach our heights after all! The time during Placements and CAT also, we were together. Indelible memories those are... <br><i>contd.</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>         There will be 3-4 chat windows open, there will be some loud music being played, somebody will be trying to teach him sitting beside him and he will be listening to music, ensuring the pissed off person who is so laboriously trying to teach him, reading 2-3 blogs and chatting - all the four things at a time. If you are thinking, well we all do that on just any other day, no. My dear friends, thats Himank for you, just hours before exams <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	When I try to reel back and think when was the first time that we spoke and how exactly did we become good friends, my memory gives me away. I think it was through Prashant that we met. Himank is a total BC baaz, you only have to have 25 hours a day to listen to his stories. We always have a lot of topics to talk - movies, music, books , blogs .. He is quite passionate about his blog and is very regular at it. A guy totally stung by BEATLES, a co-lover of NIRVANA and Curt <img src=Smileys/1.gif />Knowing him so well, I can never form a mental picture Himank studying, but hell, he is a total <b>BOND</b>.. The fact that he cracked CAT without much effort shows how damn intelligent he is. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>	The best memory for me would be the way we all played in the rain back in 2nd semester  after our endsems which was followed making paper planes - it indeed is one of the best memories I am going to take back from IIIT. Another would be the jal jeera 'shot' we had during Nishant's treat - absolute disaster it was. Even before I took I sip, Himank finished the whole glass. Apparently he is an expert in taking shots.. Bad.. very bad!!<br><br>	Wishing you truck loads of good luck and yes, do stay in touch, atleast for the sake of the treat that I owe you <img src=Smileys/3.gif />	</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Finally a testimonial for my best mate, my first ever best friend and a person who had always hold a special place in my life. Himank aka Bhalu is among those very very few people whom I interacted with in the first year. Actually it won't be an exxageration if I say my whole world was confined to 2-3 people and he definitely topped that list. I never had a good friend before coming to college and I actually find one in him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>I met him on the very first day in cellar and he was quite unique in his behaviour. Hair all messed up, dressed in his legendary yellow shirt, biting nails and talking n some more talking. As many people have noticed, my first impression was also of a jackass who looked quite irritating. Then I came to knew that he was in my English group and it was there that a new relationship took birth which later became so strong that both of us would have never imagined. Due to the same group, we had the same tutorials and lab sessions. We used to go together to the class, tutes and English class. He was very lazy and careless so he always wanted me to take care of his notebooks and carry them if he forgets any of them. I was his pseudo PC partner in the workspace. Back then, I had shared so many things with him that I have never done in my life before that.<br><br>Those daily walks around the campus and on the Microsoft road will definitely be among my most memorable moments in the college life. We used to talk about ourselves for hours and it was always fun to do that. He was the first person who helped me get my feelings out. I was very shy and introvert back then. He always pestered me to speak up to people and whatever change people notice in my behaviour these days, its all because of him. I owe him very much <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He totally changed me for my own good and has been my constant support. He gave me the name "Pagal Kutta" and that's because I used to "speak so much".<br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Come second year and he converted to CSE from ECE and used to sit next to me in lectures. He was never into studies and never let others to study. Constantly talking, irritating by doing somethings or playing on his mobile during the lectures. There have been a number of times when he told me some of his secrets and two of them are very special because both the times I was the first one to know about them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of them is now known by many of us but another one is still lying deep inside his heart and I hope your dream gets fulfilled <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Thanx a lot for putting so much faith in me and telling me that because it makes you feel very special when someone does like that.<br><br>There have been bad times in our friendship but they never lasted for a long time. I remember an incident when I was upset with something and I wrote a mail instead of telling him. He replied with a mail and it was very touching. He also told me that the first poem he wrote on his blog was dedicated to me. I was overwhelmed by this and can never forget that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He has been with me everytime for the first two years and when we shifted to OBH, he again became my neighbour. Here he became much more irritating and he along with Chand have irritated me so much that I actually decided to change the wing once. I would have never wanted it with him but things started degrading and somehow differences started to creep in between our relationship. I don't know if he has realised this or not but our bond is not the same as it was in the first two years. I get irritated very much and sometimes I cannot even bear a sight of him. He pisses me off more often than ever before. We do not talk much, do not share things. I seriously hope things get back to normal between us because he is one guy who I never want to lose. <br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>On a lighter note, he is a damn good blogger and until some time back, his posts were always fun to read and one of the favourite pastime. But now he writes some shit and I do not read. But he pesters people to just leave a comment on the blog even if you don't want to read the complete post. Multitasking like girls and has more girl friends than boys. Everytime you go to his room, he'll be reading some article, chatting with 3-4 girls, playing solitaire, twittering and smoking. During all this, a video or movie is being played in the background.<br><br>The thing that defines him other than BC and blog is daroo. He is a tank when it comes to drinking and you can pour as many alcohol as you want. Until recently I have never seen him out after drinking. But these days sala har baar out ho jata hai. He is the chairman of the elite bewada group <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. As far as I remember, there has been no booze session where he was not present except one and that too because he was not in the town <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He was the one who introduced me to drinking and smoking, though I quit smoking some time back. You can always find him irritating people all around the campus. He never discriminates between girls and boys when it comes to irritating and his all time favourite victim being Prashasti. He has not left a bit of his nails, even then he keeps on biting them. Janaab sutta aise maarte hain jaise kisi ne zabardasti muh mein thoos diya ho. bhai agar itna hi bura lagta hai to mat piya kar <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 4</b><br><br>I always wanted some people to stay in Hyderabad after the college and he was always in that list. I'm happy that he didn't make it to IIM <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and he is placed in Hyd. Just want to tell you that you have always hold a very special place in my life and due to some reasons which I don't know, things have changed. I'm really sorry if I have ever hurt you and I forgive you for all that irritation you caused. I hope things will get back to normal.<br><br><b>Most memorable moments</b> include MS party, those innumerable walks during the first years, English classes. Its been one hell of a  ride with this chap with so many ups and downs and I'll cherish soooooo many of the moments spent with him. We'll always stay in touch. Thanx a lot for everything <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May God bless you with all the happiness and you get the girl of your dream soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Good luck for that and keep trying for the same <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Remember the first day and how the registration went? It all began there with me, Tejaswi, PK and Himank standing right behind each other. Himank was the guy who bitched the most and cursed the administration for taking things so slow. His popularity in first year can be seen from the fact that he (with Rama Reddy) was the bakra of section B. Any anything happened and he would be given bumps for no reason at all <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> One must also not miss out on the hair style he had during those days. If you ever get the pics of independence day celebrations of 2005, do check out his hairstyle. Totally hilarious <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> An honorary mention should also be made regarding his love for Preity Zinta in first year. He had this huge collection of Preity Zinta wallpapers which he used to so shamelessly flaunt <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>He loves doing BC, talking about stuff around. He realized it in first yr. itself that he can do BC with at max 4-5 people in the wing but if he uses a blog, he can reach out to a wider set of audience <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and thus started his blogging days. He is one of the most prolific bloggers and his name is sure to come first if history textbooks ever talk about blogging + UG2k5.<br><br>Throughout these four years he has taught me loads of stuff and for this reason becomes my guru. He taught me the right way to drink beer, smoke cigarretes and take neat vodka shots. Introduced me to the world of Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley. He is also pretty cool and handles difficult situations pretty well - one more thing I learnt. This list just goes on endlessly and I'm sure many others also regard him as a guru <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We were in great contact when he was in NBH and me in GHEb and then from 3rd year onwards when we became "adjacent-wing" mates, we've known each other so much more. Tomorrow when he goes away I'll really miss his occasional BC, his jokes, his sarcasms, but most of all - him. Here's wishing him best of luck in whatever activity he takes up. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>most memorable moment - I, Raman and Himank drinking beer on the road. Police comes and catches us. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

But met him pretty late in cellar, he looked dumb in the beginning.<br>But we jelled well. This guy is perhaps the fastest brains I have come across. He calculates powers of 2 for fun, remembers  vehicles registration numbers. tries to find out arbit relation between any number sequence, multiplies numbers just for the heck of it, counts stairs while climbing them. Has a feminine brain, he is damn good at multitasking, he can play strip poker, do an assignment and can watch a movie at the same time. For many he is irritating, has a habit of biting his nails. He is bad at remembering faces, for him all the<br>strangers look alike. Its fun to hear him singing.. have you heard an old tape recorder when the voice gets squeaky, if not then you can ask this guy to sing, especially "Kal ho Na Ho".<br>Has an interesting laughing style,spins his head while laughing. A sloth, he has placed his bed in the middle of the room so that he could access everything from the bed itself. How can I forget<br>his prolonged "So raha hoon be" whenever I ask him to come out of his room.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>I have never seen him serious about his acads still he manages to do good. He has a wierd explanation to it, he believes that he fails in things for which he sincerely works! And interestingly he has managed to do good<br>without much effort. But, saying this doesn't mean he is not serious or dedicated about anything. He loves to blog, which he believes<br>is the only thing to which he has been committed for so long. He is perhaps the most popular blogger of the college and his blog is<br>more popular then him. He loves Maths which is pretty evident. Loves Sachin Tendulkar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> aah! I have had some interesting question rounds with him on this topic "If you love Sachin Tendulkar then... " He has a great female following. Everyday, you can find him chatting with some<br>or the other girl. And when asked who she is, he has a typical answer "Abe dost hai be!" I have to admit, its fun reading his chats. Likes classic rock, aah! Beatles apun dono ka favourite.<br>likes listening to old crappy ghazals, loves watching black and white movies, die hard fan of Shammi Kapoor.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>We do BC almost every night, I know I am going to miss that. All those pillion rides together. Arbit incidents happen when ever we two are together. There are many things common about us. Be it , our opinion about people, our views and interestingly even our love life, the series of commonalities never seems to end. I am going to miss all this now, the late night BC with a sutta in our hand, how I would disturb him every fifteen minutes and gulp down his filled water bottle. He is a monsterous drinker. How can I forget when he drank the whole "khamba", fucking amazing. He is among the few with whom I have shared every bit of my life. Bhalu, you mean a lot to me as a friend. At times I have been a total jerk but he has always supported me.<br>Bhalu would never let us know when he is sad, this bastard is damn good at faking emotions. Whenever he is sad, he would pretend as if everything is fine. Remember, whatever you wrote for me applies to you as well. He is the entertainer of our group, because he is always upto something. Totally restless. He is a total fun freak, he never gets tired of it, I remember, he came from a long train journey and immediately left for Nagarjuna Sagar. If I have to booze he seldom gives a "NO" for an answer. Me, him Vipul and Adi we form an elite beveda group. I would<br>cherish all the BCs we had after we got drunk. I remember,When you let out your feelings for some girl near the Banyan Tree and the next reaction<br>from our side was "How screwed up are you man!". He has hidden a secret from all of us for very long and I hope my friend you get your girl <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part IV<br><br>Four years, it has been an amazing journey. I don't remember if we had an argument on anything. Some memories, the suttas we had together, Club 8<br>outings, tea at Manoj's stall, Victor ki sawari, going late for the class together,reading your chats, Leofying you, copying your singing style, finishing your paani ki bottle, the third day of Felicity when I saw you crying for the first time and that too for no reason(he couldn't see Maroo crying!), cursing you for writing stupid monotnous fucking long blogs, "spoj"ing together,asking you random numbers multipication, aapna bottoms up competition (which I won hands down), the support you gave me during placements, our late night BC sessions. These four years have been memorable for me, I never really had good friends before coming here.  But, my search for friends really came to an end here. You made these four years even more special and memorable.You have been an amazing friend, supportive, I owe a lot to you.

<b><a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>There are many notorious nicks by which people call him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, and he has distinctly framed an image of a super hyperactive guy who just whims to have fun and BC all the time. In first year oftenly I have shared a neighboring seat with him in the class. To hell with the lecture, this guy was immersed in his own fancy, always humming some hindi song lullaby. He is one of the few person whom I met till now and are very passionate..the pulse of passion is always in full flow through his veins. I still rem how weirdly he used to play antakshari in class. Let sing 10 Kishore da songs starting with the word "jindagi". He can't remain sit idle even for a while. If there is nothing he pinches u hard - C'mmon why so serious? Then in workspace I alwayz find this guy on high. He is bond in coding, all knows that. I used to sit opposite to him in workspace. "wah kya gaana hai, sound full kar"- he would kind of scream out when he heard one of the kishore da or lucky ali's song playing on my sys.<br>Lots of our talk involved to my home town, to garhwal where he has spent 5 years ...and is totally in love with it. Well I will make u recherish those days again...let visit the place again sometime near in future, I will be looking fwd to that trip..whateva I used to narrate u about that place u will urself see that.<br>I admire him for his passion. Someone told me that this guy completed the whole series of Friends in straight 2-3 seatings skipping even meals. I am avid reader of his blog. This guy just pour out his heart on the blog. I really enjoy reading them.Keep writing.<br>I know you as a good friend, though haven't spent much time with u..stay in touch. *Friends Forever*<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Himank ya Bhalu , the guy next door in cellar. I remember one day I was playing lucky ali's Sunoh in very high volume, suddenly he came to my room, I thought he will  ask me to lower the voice, on the contrary he was happy and told me how much he love Lucky ali and recommended me few of his songs. Banda nhate samay hamesha gaata tha, he, alok aur shashank used to make that place unbearable. Is a fodu blogger and 200% BCBaaz, BC ke liye hamesha ready rehta hain, chahe woh mailing list mein karni ho ya fir any place. Peene ke maamle mein I don't think anyone in our batch can give him a competition <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Banda intelligent hain, means w/o much effort he manages to crack IIM, MS intern exam <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His multitasking is really admirable. Placement ke samay bhi banda har written nikalta tha, when I told him "You are selected in IVY" , his response was "abe yaar mazzak mat kar" <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif />, who does that. Highest Level of coolness yeh yaar yeh toh <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> His passion abt cricket and Sachin (Tendulkar <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) is worth mentioning. Banda knows everything abt him.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Greatly fond of numbers and loves playing around with them, even while he is drunk <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Can do even the toughest of calculations in no time. Travel with him roadside and one can find him playing with numbers on number plate of vehicles and is fun to watch. Testimony to his love for maths are his exceptionally high scores in quant section of aimcats. Even managed to get a call from IIM-L without any preparation for CAT which is indeed commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Loves his music esp. Beatles and listens to a wide genre of songs from old hindi to hard rock.<br>Restless to the core and is very much curious to know about each and everything around him. A total nocturnal and a big time lazy. No matter how hard you knock his door during his sleeping hours, he won't care to get up and open it.  If by chance he wakes up, most of his conversations with other people takes place with his lying on the bed and others standing outside his room shouting through his window. One of the biggest suttebaaz and bewda our batch. Saale ko daroo kabhi chadti hi nahi, kitni bhi pila do <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Lots of sweet memories to associate with him in the past four years like - outing on Dusshera in 1st sem, his bhukkad style of pizza slices in pizza hut during Ramzan offer in 2nd year, endless BC sessions in NBH-47, infinite cricket chats praising Sachin, Goa trip in Dec'07,  Halo - typical Bhalu istyle <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, Kal ho na ho - har ghadee badal rahi hai .... again the Bhalu style <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, daroo sabha on 3rd night of Felicity'08, swimming sessions in Feb'09 and many more.<br><br>All in all Bhalu has been one of my good friends in IIIT. All the best for your future bro. Ivy mein macha dena hamesha ki tarah <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br><b>Fav.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Bhalu. One of the first memories associated with him is the ragging period when one of the seniors asked me to find Himank Sharma and bring him to them. Since I was not aware who he was, they gave me a hint that the restless guy from your batch who goes on speaking and biting his nails. And as I reached NBH entrance, there he was BCing his usual way with some of our batchmates and irritating them. Back then he appeared a total ch***** to me <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. But as I got to know him more that image transformed into a totally opposite one. But one thing that still remains the same about him is unique style of irritating people around him. This was of the reasons why I used to avoid talking to him during the first year, banda sir mein dard kara deta tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br>The guru of multitasking who is always busy doing 4-5 activities a time and each one with perfection, wonder how <img src=Smileys/7.gif />.  Still remember those tutes in Shashank's room in first year when this guy used to just sit around with cellphone in his hand, busy SMSing people. Everyone used to get frustrated by his acts and I felt banda bahut hero banta hai, jab saale ki paper mein lagegi tab akkal aaegi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But still he was the one who understood more than anyone out there and paper mein fod ke aata tha.<br>Has immense love for blogging. Loves writing about anything and everything around and even promoting his blog by any possible means <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. One of the few who have kept the blog culture alive in our campus and even made attempts to encourage the juniors to do the same. A total BCbaaz who loves speaking and speaking. Cricket is one thing on which we had done more BC than anything else. Those swimming sessions in Feb'09 when we used to get so much involved discussing about cricket that we used to completely forget that we were there something else. When I put Bhalu and cricket together how can I forget to mention his obsession for Sachin. He is simply crazy about the little master. Don't even dare to speak against Sachin in front of him, he might even kill you for that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>HIMANK was one of my very first friends in the college. He is a very cool guy who impressed me with his knowledge within a first few classes of our college. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> In DLD class, when our prof. used to ask a question, he was the one who used to give the correct answer within seconds.<img src=Smileys/13.gif /> And that used to awe me a lot cuz I was not able to guess that how could a guy answer a question when some concepts related to it were still to be taught.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> But then later I came to know that he used to come to the class after reading the topic.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>But that does not mean I am doubting his intelligence.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Even I must say he is one of the most intelligent guy in our batch.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Without studying much, he performs well in the exams.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> And one best example for the last statement is that he passed CAT(written) without much preparation.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I usually don't consider myself studious but if you are comparing me with him then i have to accept that I am studious but in spite of that I do not perform as well as compared to him in exams.<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> That surely implies that whenever he studies, he dedicates his whole concentration towards it.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I must learn this trait from him.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>In addition to it, he is a great blogger. Whenever he touches his blog, he generally posts 2-3 articles on the same day. <br><br>And one thing which we loved most doing together was keeping same status message on gtalk -<br><center><b>"How much hours are still left before the end of exams."<img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></center><br>We both used to night out at the last day of exam.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> And I used to ping him throughout the night regarding the updation of status message. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> It was really a fun.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I just wanna say that Himank, you can do wonders in whatever u maneuver.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Wish you a great future ahead.<br>MISS YOU A LOT!!<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

Maroo bechara CAT ke dino mein bahut pareshan hua hai. Dumble vala incident to yaad hoga hi jab har bande ne humein next din jam kar gaaliyan di thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Mathur ki chop karna, saath-2 paani bharne jana. Seriously man, I can never forget the kind of things we have done while living in this wing. Awesome memories. I can never ever forget you guys. Bahut saari baatein rah gayi hain. But you know this fu**ing time limit and my laziness .... will continue more on orkut for sure. One suggestion( this is the first suggestion I'm giving in my testimonials but I think this is required): Realize your potential. You are very-very sharp but you have got a very careless and carefree attitude. I feel that you can achieve wonders in your life with your kind of brain but it needs to be concentrated at something. I won't say that may God give you whatever you aspire for in your life (because I know ki teri bandiyon ko chod kar life mein kuch aspirations nahi hongi.) but I'll definitely say that may God give you some aspirations and then you can achieve those yourself I'm confident about that. Ab toh mujhe irritate karna thoda kam kar de. Pata nahi aur kitne time jhelna padega tujhe <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But actually speaking, if you won't irritate me, then I'll miss something for sure <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Remain in touch even if one of us moves out of Hyderabad.

God knows how does he manage all that. Iska phone par hello bolne ka dhang bhi awesome hai .... Aello .... nail biting is also one of his habits. Duniya ki har weird cheez agar ek insaan mein dhoondni ho to Bhalu definitely jeetega usmein. This guy loves blogging and one of the most successful bloggers of IIIT. But, jab Chand iski maarne par aata hai, chahe vo blogging ho ya belly ho ya bandiyan, gandi maarta hai. Mazaa aa jata hai. He loves Sachin Tendulkar. Agar Sachin ise kuch bhi karne ko kahe, kuch bhi (you know what I mean <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), to ye uski har baat bina soche samjhe maan lega. <br><br>We did internship in MS together.

I have never seen a guy who could irritate more than him. Isko kabhi bhi kisi ko bhi irritate karne ko bol do, ye kar sakta hai and he feels proud at this achievement.<br><br>Interaction with him began in the first year when we all went for Dussehra outing. Ultimate cool banda hai. Kabhi bhi ise exam ki ya CAT ki (<img src=Smileys/4.gif />) tension lete hue nahi dekha. BC kabhi bhi karva lo, hamesha ready rahega. An extremely intelligent, talented and gifted guy who doesn't need much preparation for anything and if he does, then he screws that up. This guy got a 99+ percentile in CAT and an internship in Microsoft without preparing much for those. He has a passion for numbers and calculation. Har time baithe baithe kuch na kuch calculate karta rehta hai ya numbers ke saath khelta rehta hai. Class mein baithkar mahashay ko 2^100 calculate karne mein khoob maza aata hai. I think he should have born nearly 50-60 years ago. Isko har cheez purani hi pasand aati hai. 70s ka music sunta hai, 30s - 40s ki movies dekhta hai. Ajeeb hi interests hain is bande ke. Hitler se pyaar hai inhe (saale tu bhi Hitler se kam nahi hota jab tu irritate karne par aata hai) . Iske room par jao to jab bilkul shanti hogi, tab 5-10 min baad SHAYAD tumhe aisa lage ki kuch music chal raha hai. Bahut hi low volume par music sunta hai aur jab tumhe pata chalta hai ki music chal raha, then you'll also notice that he is enjoying the music as well. pata nahi ise sun kaise jata hai. Jab bhi bahar nikalte hain, tab stars mein pata nahi kya kuch dhoondta rehta hai. Sahi mein ajeeb hi banda hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I think he is the biggest boozer of our batch. MS party kabhi nahi bhoolunga main haramkhor <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Iske jaise kamine suttebaazon ki vajah se main bhi passive smoker ban gaya hun <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . Banda Casanova to hai hi.

I had nothing to do so I agreed.. phir to kya tha .. nikal gaye hum log ... lingampally station se left right left right karte karte kahin pahunche .. and we realised that we were lost... phir socha ki wapas chalna chahiye... matlab we were almost 10 kms away from DLF ... jab vapas aa rahe the tab ek building dikhi... bhalu bhaisaab bolte hain ki abe ye to DLF aa gayi ... I then realised that something was wrong with bhalu ... On our way back he told me that he was on high at that time... This shows that u never know what he is upto ... <br><br>4. Club 8 Parties and his dance step : I will remember u for all the parties we had and your typical dance step that u always do and that made us ROFL ... <br><br>Coming on to other side of Bhalu <br><br>5 Multi-Tasking - Whenever you visit his room .. you can see him <br>chatting to 4-5 "GIRLS" .. phew! <br>listening and maintaining playlists ...<br>using last fm using twitter ...<br>Phone pe msging .. <br>sutta ...<br>ETC ... <br>In all limitless BC karta hai ye banda ...

Always insisted me to write something or the other. Infact, I started writing one, but my lazyness didn't allow me to continue. He along with Karan have worked their asses off(even after coming to 4th year) to keep-up the spirit of the blogging culture in IIIT. The first post that I read on his blog was about the whole batch putting up "United we stand" as status messages. And the next post was the most hilarious one. About Pagare Baba's style <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And according to me its the best post ever written by him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Cricket.</b> He;s a very big fan of Sachin. I dare say anything in front of him reagarding cricket.<br><br><b>Music</b> Again he's a music freak and a great fan of the Beatles. Also he has a very big database of Old Hindi songs. Even to date, this guy hates rap. Dude, kabhi to rap ko appriciate kar liya karo yaar. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Itna kuch bata diya to chalo <b>padhai</b> ke baare me bhi bata hi doon. This guy is a bond, real bond. He's pretty quick at understanding all difficult subjects. Also he's a big math g33k.

Also, his fodu verbal skills have helped him in cracking CAT. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>There was a time when this guy really irritated me and I got all frustated and beat him. I'm sorry dude, sometimes I can't control my anger. That day, I thought that this behavior of mine can create some disturbances in our friendship. But I was shocked to see that he took it positively and continued talking to me in the same way as always. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.

Once we went outside just for a small walk and we ended up reaching Kothaguda.

This also meant that I had to be away from room. This kind of became a hurdle, and we slowly drifted away from each other . The next summer, I worked hard in CVIT and had rarely spent time with him. <br><br><br>In third year, he was the only one from the entire group to help me shift from NBH to 3rd floor OBH.

This was time I shared all my secret stories, including the bajji one <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. We became one helluva of roomies, we were compatible with each other. <br><br>I had no problems listening to what he used to play <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. It was good for me too, I didnot have the trouble to maintain a playlist <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . That is why I didnot unpack my speakers, which eventually got lost in felicity <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . He did allow me to play some eminem rap at times, but on the condition that I allow him to play Hindi-oldies which I hated the most ( I still do <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> ) . Shifting with me did create a some problems for him, the room got congested because we had two tables instead of one. Cleaning the room was an herculean task, that is why we used to do it once in a month or so <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>One incident which I will remember :- <br>We went to mehdipatnam, for shopping.

I raised my head to see who it was, and I saw a chu*iya discussing solutions/doubts in the assignment with another chu*iya <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . And I thought, What the fk is this guys problem ? He looked like a g33k, another faccha who has knowledge of progg. b4 coming to IIIT. And he was kind of irritating too.<br><br><br><i> Well that was his first impression on me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </i>. <br><br>The rest of the sem, I found him in lab late in nights doing one thing or the other. Just like me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br><br><b> Sem2 </b>, <br><br>We were in the same friends group. And he was one of the first guys whom I thought I should be friends with. By now, that chu*iya/g33k image had changed, but he was still irritating <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Sem2 was the time we became close. I was kind of like his pseudo-roomie. His roomie used to be out of the room except for sleeping in the nights. And <br>the rest of time we used to listen to songs/ talk abt random things/ blog / browse .. basically do Himank's fav thing, that is BC <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . Late at nite, his roomie would come, that meant I would have to leave for my room in m*f*kng  GHEB <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . He was the first guy in our group to get a cell phone, that day was so awesome. We started taking pics of each and everything <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Each and every outing was well documented by his camera. He became a phone-addict, used to listen to songs on his erricson, used to sms to lots of people( read girls ) . I think he still holds the record for fastest-SMS writing among us. Vipul and Himank used to hang-out a lot at that time too.And thus I got introduced to Vipul thru him<img src=Smileys/10.gif />.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i> Part 5</b></i><br><br>Next, the water cooler tradition (started by him and me). Everytime we have to fill our waterbottles, we take each other, Manish, Vipul, Chand, Kshitij and Mathur along. Anybody who refuses is given the strictest possible punishment!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> It is as if we've become kids all over again. Remember "Dishum dishum" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In fact, I've absolutely loved this wing, its given me such sweet memories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I'm really gonna miss all this <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Ahh.. Staying in this wing, I've also noticed his wierd habit of laughing out really loud when he is alone and watching sitcoms. Everytime you hear loud claps and laughter, you know its Himank watching That 70s show <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Haha!<br><br>Placements '08. Everyone knows how it was. We were the comforting factor for each other. We would always count the number of unsuccesful company-interviews we'd given; and I remember Bhalu, Soni and myself being in the lead. I remember the CA interview, when he didn't get through. We were all very sad, and Adi (who was with him then) called me and asked me to console him. I tried, but it was very difficult. That was one day when we could really feel the pain. And <br>come 18th December, the next day. Ivy Comptech, both of us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Destiny. What relief we felt back then! That night, when we were BCing in his room is one of my fav memories. Yes, we had got placed- but it did not feel alright. First of all, how could we (especially Himank) face Chand, with who he was supposed to get placed? And second, we felt so wierd that most of our close friends did not even congratulate us (even a few days after getting placed) (The former is understandable to an extend as the others had not got placed then) And the final count - Himank 7 companies, me 6 companies <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 4</b></i><br><br>I also remember the poor chap going behind IV to get money from Microsoft <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Post Felicity, we'd have a lot of BC on the same. And the daroo party after Felicity - awesome. I also remember that after the farewell daroo party last year, he was the one who dragged me back to my room at 5 AM in the night so that I could attend Amazon's internship interview. Atleast I got to give the interview at 10 AM the next morning in a state of hangover. But for him, I'd have missed that! Its also the right context to mention two things- one that Himank is the biggest boozers around and two his MS internship, which he got through without much preperation. Oh.. And yeah, hes scared about me for something which I cant mention here <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>How come I haven't mentioned his blogging as yet? Maruti and he were the guys who originally took up blogging in the batch, and they've continued it to this day. His child-like obsessions with the blog comments and hits is amazing, and everyone knows how Himank would bug everyone till they visited his blog. Both of us also conducted the first IIIT Bloggers' meet. Btw, visit his blog at lifeizlikethat.wordpress.com <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And Sachin.. Sachin is his biggest passion after numbers. As fellow cricket lovers (add Pagare to it), we've had some amazing discussions on cricket, especially when sloshed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Both of us keep discussing all matches, and enjoy reading the cricinfo commentry <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>In fourth year, I got to shift to THE wing, and luckily have Himank as my neighbour. We have had some fabulous memories in the wing! I christened him as my 'Guruji' and he has been the one to defend me whenever I get leofied! So much so, that I am on the other side of the table now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The way we leofy Maglu in OBH mess- rofl!! Everyone else would get irritated, but we would go on and on! Absolutely love that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Every night, Chand and he would have the BC-sutta (<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) <br>sessions, and I've always enjoyed joining in (only the BC part).<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>Come second year, and I moved to cellar. That was when I started hanging out very regularly with this chap. I remember leofying Maruti like crazy. And the rock (He is crazy about Beatles) we'd listen to in his room. Or the stinking room which both his and my room would be <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Or the regular BC sessions in the corridor. It was at that time that we started going for walks together.. And we'd discuss a plethora of things. In fact, it was with him that I went for a walk along the MS corridor for the first time. And he is the one who discovered how cool a place the new main building terrace was <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The evenings spent <br>there.. Awesome! <br><br>A lot of those walks were devoted to talking about our personal issues. First thing, like all of us, Himank has also changed a lot over the last few years- his ego has certainly gone for a spin. He is the kind of guy who always likes his friends to be united, together during the good and bad times and is very touchy about this. He is a huge well wisher for the people he likes. Yes, during those walks, we'd also talk about people <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And one of my most memorable walks with him was during the scuffle incident- when I kept trying to convince him something. But yeah, he doesnt like it when he keeps trying to convince <br>others about joining in for an outing, and people disagree. Case in point, the recent Holi when guys did not join in inspite of a lot of persuasion. He went red with frustration and anger!<br><br>Another of my favourite memories with him has been organizing MnM in Felicity '07 together. Rathi got busy, and it was upto two of us to do the event along with the junis. And we had an absolute blast while doing the same! Himank, remember that girl in pink who comes around every year? And how you refused to let her participate? Haha. It was an amazing moment when MnM finally got over and we got to hug each other. The experience helped him in being the main organizer <br>for MnM in Felicity '08, which was again very succesful.<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>He loves just lying around in his bed, chatting, twittering, blogging, browsing, BCing.. All at once! I just cant see how he multitasks so easily.. Its just the opposite for most of us.. In fact, I had to switch off the music in order to be able to write this testimonial! He absolutely loves social netowrking, and just cannot stay without the same! I remember he (and <br>Pagare) checking their scraps everytime they'd go for BC to someones rooms. Ahh.. And I also remember how desperate he was to get to the 1000-scrap mark before 1st year vacations. I think he was among the first persons to do so. Congos for that <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>But inspite of being very lazy, this guy has always managed to do well in his academics. His flair for numbers is well documented. He did very well in CAT in spite of hardly ever bothering to prepare for it (Coincidence that we managed to screw the same section up). However, an MBA's probably not the thing for him. He has other passions, and we'd all love it if he decides to pursue them. Well actually, hes confused about what hes gonna do in the future, and I think <br>thats a good sign. I say that because it shows that hes thinking about his life and career. Which is a big thing in itself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>My next memory of his is after the gang was formed.. That of his new cell phone camera. The camera (inspite of being a VGA) was a craze back then, especially given that NONE of us had camera phones back then. And the amount of photos we've taken with that phone.. Unbelievable! He also has a fetish for SMSing, especially the fairer sex! Ahh.. and coming to that, hes always had a queer relationship with females. There are some females in his life who are neither girlfriends, nor sisters, nor friends.. But are still very close to him! And in spite of having way with the ladies, hes managed to pass the four years in <br>college without a girlfriend! Needless to mention, a lot of us think that hes among the most frustrated souls around <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I wonder when he'd find his dream girl!<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>I am about to embark upon one of the most exiting journeys possible, that is writing a testimonial for Guruji <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its been such an amazing journey, one which seen absolutely no downs! Our friendship has hardly ever (read never) seen skirmishes and its been an uphill journey (if I can use the expression) throughout. I must thank God for blessing me with such a friend!<br><br>Lets start right at the beginning. In the initial days, I just knew him as that 'chutiya' from cellar who always hung out with that other 'idiot', PK <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Of the few times I visited cellar, I found him very irritating. In fact, I found a lot of people in cellar wierd at that time <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Fast forward to Dussera 2005. It was for the first time that we really got a break from the crazy first year schedule. We had a lot of time on our hands, and were wondering what to do. <br>That was when I suggested that we go and hang out for the entire day and a lot of people agreed. I was chosen to show people around, having a fair knowledge of Hyderabad. I remember a lot of guys joined in.. Himank, Adi, Chirag, PK, Shrikant, Raman, Kabra, Manish, Shashank etc. And we had an absolute blast that day! We visited a lot of places.. Central, Lifestyle, ccd, bakers inn, hi-tech city, cyber pearl and that resturant.. It was an amazing day. That was when I first started interacting with this guy. And I realised that hes not such an ass after all <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In fact, I found him very funny!<br><br>That was the starting point for our dosti. I remember the way he used to play stick cricket in workspace. And his always chilled and relaxed attitude. He would be among the last guys to start off with Jawahar's assignment and always finish them all! But he was (and is) as lazy as one can get. Just try moving him out of his room when hes lying on his bed. It is nothing less than a Roadies 6.0 task!<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Himonkey, is one of the most coolest person in our batch. He is very relaxed about everything. One of the avid blogger of our batch. <br>I remember mainly the exams which we gave during first year <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> !! <br>He is a person who comes last in the examination halls and leaves the first. Always fidgeting. <br>Good luck !! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Writing a testimonial for Himank is fun because as much as I think of the times spent with him, all I do is smile and smile some more. I headr of him for the first time from some senior saying "abe vo chutiya kaun hai jo kal raat Naman Tyagi se milne aaya tha". Next day I saw him in front of NBH roaming arounf wearing a long shirt(tucked out) and totally lost -  abig chutiya he was back then <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I dont' exactly remember when we became friends but yes the earliest memories would be me always bugging him to do my code. Yes I was besharam enough to ask him to write the entire code for mr and not just debug it. I used to meet him almost daily in Raman;s room where he used to come to meet Vipul mainly. Back then he was a regular guy to me. Come third semesterwe had a cold war. which persisted for atleast a month or so. The reason was he teasing me on that baba thing for longer than I expected and he not knowing that I was pissed. But then we sorted things out and since then it has been one hell of a roller coaster ride with this asshole.<br><br>Very late I realizes that he is a big genius and a Maths freek. Thats because he would be the last one to boast anything about himself. Restless to the core, he just cannot do a single thing at a time. Most of the times in his room, he is chatting on gtalk, yahoo, reading articles on cricinfo, indiatimes, listening to Beatles and John Mclean, SMSing on cell and coding on another laptop - all at the same time. Its like the first word he uttered at the age of 2 was - multi-tasking <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is totally obsessed with Sachin, Hitler and Beatles. And he has this flair for old English black n white movies ( Iwonder how any one can bear them).</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Boozing with him has been a total delight at times and then totally frustating at times when he just speaks and speaks and speaks - all bull shit. Firstly, I take the credit for introducing him to booze <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But from then on he has covered a long distance and he is on his way over my league in terms of capacity. We have had some truly amazing times drinking, starting from 12th July 2006. That was the beginning of zillion more drinks to follow. Whenever the two of us drink together, there is one and only one topic that we discuss - bandiyaan, be it in the room or Suraj or Gardenia or Nikitha. We even came to a conclusion once that we two are the only desperate souls left, others are content with what they have <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He has this mammoth capacity to drink a lot - I mean lot. Once he finished one whole bottle of vodka almost by himself. Memorable moments include me and him debating on Sachin with this guy( who claimed he was a prof. from NIFT) at Gardenia. We ripped him apart for sure. Then there was Bhalu calling Chand - "abe to aaja lene Indirapur, hum log Kondacity mein out hain".</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Another facade to Bhalu is his friendship with the fairer sex. Its like he has a ladki dost n each and every city of India, and that too the pretty one's <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And since I knew this I have ever wondered what is so special about this guy and it is a still a mystery to me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Inspite of having so many friends, he is still single (atleast thats' what I know <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )-poor girls. With Bhalu its never 'mera dost', its always 'meri dost'. And he takes absolute pleasure in telling his yester year's stints with chicks. On a future note, I am pretty sure he'll have the prettiest chiks around him(actually he still does).<br><br>He is very much into astronomy and constellations and if you are walking with him in the open sky, you are sure to find him halting and staring upwards(so irritating that is). He is intelligent enough to do an MS internship and get a IIM-L call. I hope he makes it and gets out of Hyderabad and that is the only way he would be satisfied(you know why <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br><br>Memorable moments include the 20-20 WC final. We had decided that we would booze to Indian victory, though we had Compilers end sem the next day.India won. Our bad luck that it was dry day that day(Ganesha Chaturthi),we travelled some 20 kms and managed just a fruit juice <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Another and the most recent once would be our random night out at Medhchal(NH-7),some 40kms from college with no prior plan and minimal paise in pocket. Some fun that was.<br><br>I know a secret of him which no one else knows, purely no one and I take pleasure in that. Probably the only guy in whom I find very little negatives (bas irritating hai bohot saara <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) I am very very fond of this asshole and wish him all the success in life. A request - bastard call me in future when I am not around.<br><br>Song for you: vo to hai albela, hazaron mein akela, sada tumne aib dekha, hunar ko naa dekha.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
