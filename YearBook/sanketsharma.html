<b><a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>dadddddu ... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I must confess - mujhe ise dekh kar hi hassi aa jaati hai. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Whenever I see this person - I wonder what he might be thinking! When he is talking - I wonder what else is he thinking! When I see him walking alone (with his million dollar laptop bag <img src=Smileys/3.gif />) - I still wonder ab is ka khurapati dimag kya soch raha hoga.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Even when I read his mail... ... In nutshell, this person makes me think a lot!! I am at loss to figure out when he is talking seriously and when he is joking. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I seriously start laughing whenever I see him .. and this is true so much so that - in one of our courses, from the moment he came in front of class to give a presentation, I started smiling and I laughed my heart out during the whole presentation. I think it was his style of speaking. Though the presentation was very serious. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He can make every dull moment - rangeen !!<br><br>Daddu ki alag hi 'ada' hai!! I am a huuuuge fan of his style of doing things.<br>Ab dont get the idea - that he's only a mischief maker. He has done a million and one things for the batch and helped many individuals. Kisi ka mobile kho gaya tha and someone narrated how daddu managed to get it back -- I thought it was a well-knit story by some one to mock daddu ki 'daddu'giri <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Bindaas banda hai. And samajhdaar too. He can single-handedly handle huge responsibilities. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He has excellent communication skills and can convince people 'of any thing'. Believe me!!<br><br>When he gave his farewell speech and reminded us of things we are going to miss.. I thought of one more thing that he could have added -- "there will be no daddu around to do things for you people".<br><br>Good Luck and wish you loads of success in life!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mere pyare dadde, sabse pehle to I must apologize you for doubting you in the past. For all our difference of opinions, I now know you never intended to make me unhappy or win any argument, you always intended to tell me something valuable you knew. <br><br>Abey, 1st year ke baad maine perform hi kahan kiya. Abhi dekh, ho saka to tum logon ke jaane se pehle ek performance ho jayega <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Ok then, Sanket is a witty wily old fox, with the sense of humour that if targeted at you would drown you in embarrasment after knocking you speechless and sometimes it may take you a little while to understand that he is having a go at you. The confirmation comes with a wicked dimpled grin and you know you were being mocked at. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>But, that's the best part of him, no matter how serious the matter is, he would always end it with a smile making you feel that even though there might be a disagreement on opinions, there would never be a strain in the relation <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>A good manager, leader, and public relations maintainer, he has the knack of resolving the most serious of conflicts somehow. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> And that's all most people think of him. Don't know if anyone knows (I doubt even if he himself is aware of the fact) that he is a very sensitive person deep within. He hides it from the world and from himself, for it would portray him as a weak person.<br><br><br>Bas, aur kya kahoon, had the best of days with him initially in the college. Then did not get to share thoughts and time with each other very often. But Dudz, don't you miss those days.. everything will be back, just the way it was.. tere dost ka promise <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br><b> Aur is baar wo Doon ki tarah dhokha nahi dunga. Waada!!! </b> Hamesha aise hi khilkhilata, chamchamata, muskurata, motiyon se daant dikhata, doston ki udaata rahiyo. All the best for future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Milne aa jana kabhi kabhar Bank of America se, main to pada rahunga yahin, Kannan ki god mein. Waise, kahan hai ye bank? America mein?

<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br> Sanket a perfect organiser, a perfect leader and a very good friend of me. The first impression that came to my mind is he could be a good politician when elections for CR candidate were conducted and he told a manifesto while campaigning. While others are just confident of their so so blind supporters. Any subject he takes, he presents himself in a very impressive and convincing manner. I personally observed this boy doesn't have regional feelings at all and thought that he has some qualities that resemble me and we came together to work for batch trip. Here our friendship got stronger. But felt sorry many a time for Sanket for many reasons. I'll say the reason at the end of the batch trip. <br>         I felt bad when you didn't concentrated on MBA. You are the perfect person for that and I really wish you a success in your future. <br>           If you want to form a political party I'll be the first member <img src=Smileys/4.gif />   </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>and because this guy is like a brother to me, I blindly followed his advice, went to my room and started redaing again. and whoa!! I got placed in the very next company. Thanks bro, thanks for your advice. Nobody will ever forget the firt job of his life and the one behind that success. So am I.<br><br>Kerala trip ke kuch yaadgar pal: dormitory in Munnar, pillow fight,the incident of playing cards with MAGLU <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, the leeches that caught you near those waterfalls. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, that bus drive from periyar to cochin, jahan humne khoob jor jor se gaane gaye the. <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Cochin beach par wo Kabra ke deadly cesored pics <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In yaadon ko main kabhi bhula nahi sakta.<br><br>I know that 2nd year batch trip ke time par, mujhe south wali bus me bula rahe the. But Daddu bola ki "nahi.. Ranga hamari bus me hoga. Bas!! ". Thanks a lot for that man. Agar me 2nd year batch trip par nahi jaata na to aaj main half of the northies ko achi tarah se pehchaan hi nahi paata. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Well, so I come to the end of my testimonial to Daddu. Wanted to write a lot but sala time constraint ho gaya.<br><br>Bas itna kehna chahta hun ki jahan bhi jana haste rehna. Hasaante rehna. Aur apni is pehchaan (Daddu) ko hamesha buland rakhna.

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sanket Sharma aka Daddu aka CR<br><br>Daddu is like a big brother to me. Sorry bro, maine socha tha ki jo bahut close hain unke saath memories jyada hnge .. so last me likhte hain. But saala ab time hi nahi raha <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>ok So I was saying that Daddu is one of the most versatile guys of our batch. He can speak to any group and anyone. And most importantly, the way he speaks with anyone is so pleasing that "One can't deny the offer that he makes". <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He's my batchmate but I don;t know why, whenever I see him I feel like, he's very matured and disciplined. (maybe coz, I'm not <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). There's a lot of maturity jo ki jhalakti rehti hai bande ko dekh kar. The way he walks, the way he talks and the say he smiles.<br><br>This guy always brings a smile to my face. Jab bhi dekho hasta rehta hai. The most important quality that I've noted in him is that, whatever the sitatuin may be, this guy has the guts to face it and <b>enjoy himself</b> in it. That's a great quality dude. I mean har situation ko enjoy karte hue jeeta hai. And that's one thing I've learnt from him during the Kerala trip<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. And the result was that just one month after the Kerala trip, during our batch trip I became famous as DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Dude, there's a lot of things that can be learnt from you. You are <b>awesome</b><br><br>I still remmeber in 1st year, as a CR, this guy has always helped us in postponing assignments whenever necessary and planning different things. I wish I can go back in time and spend more time with you buddy!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He's the most most optimistic guy I've ever seen in my student life. The most optimistic. He was such a moral support to me during our placement time. And I owe you a treat bro. It was 2nd Jan I I was watching Slumdog .. for 6th time. Then comes Daddu and says "Ranga! Dekh abhi bas 3 din hi bache hain. Uske baad companies ke aane ki frequncy kam ho jayegi. 5th ko Airvana aa rah hai padh le .. jaldi se nikal le. Fir milke aish karte hain"</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I don't really know much about Daddu, or Siyar of UG2K5. All my encounters with him have been pleasant.<br>First time I saw him in NBH mess, sitting at the corner position of the table, talking to few of our batchmates, and the manner in which he looked at them and talked was enough to show his Netagiri skills... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He helped me complete my honors project 1 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I'm a BIG fan of, "Daddu ke nuskhe". <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>The batch trip in 2nd year was one of my most memorable moments in my life, and it was he who convinced me a lot to come to the batch trip. Thanks a lot for that. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>The 31st Dec '08 experience was also great, and it was daddu who dealt with the police waalas.<br>He is one of the most skilled people of our batch, the skills which can't be explicitly shown but is quite helpful in one's life. Lol, he's much mature for his age. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Nice speech on the farewell day. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> For obvious reasons... it included my name. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his special ability of knowing how to react to particular situation in a apt manner and managing things...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>the first encounter of him is during his project with sandeep.

<b><a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sanket 'Market' Sharma alias Daddu, is <i>the</i> most talked about guy of our batch. Bring anything up on the discussion table, his name is sure to crop up. We've shared relationship has been very eccentric all these years. More of a blow hot - blow cold type. Umpteen times there have been quarrels, tiffs, arguments etc. over a lot of issues between the two of us. Difference of opinion has been the bottom line of each and every one of our 'discussions'. <br><br>I remember him saying one thing to me - 'When our college days would become numbered, no matter how many arguments there might have been between us, all of these would be forgotten in those times of nostalgia'. I must say you were very correct that day <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I look back at those days and laugh at the arguments we've had. It all seems so laughable now. <br><br>He is someone who've I've admired for his managerial skills. No event is possible in IIIT without him being a part of it. Felicity, Placements, Batch trips etc. he's done them all. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Also his commitment during placements has been really worth appreciating. Even after getting placed,  he took a number of tutorials to teach many of us. The concern he showed about me getting placed was really heart-warming. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He is one of the very very few guys of our batch who can build a great career in politics if he wishes to (Give this option a serious thought, offer letter from Bank of America is still pending <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). On that note, I would like to advise you to be a little less politically correct. Speak you heart out and you'll do just as great. Being  measured and calculated always doesn't help. Let your heart speak for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>Well, it has truly been wonderful being your friend knowing that there would always be a helping hand from your side. A guy who knows how to handle different types of people <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. It is a great quality dude, one that I have always longed to learn but have not quite done it.<br><br>Here's wishing you all the very best for the future (I know you'll be pretty successful in what ever you do).<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Daddu<br><br>Daddu and me had an interesting friendship story,<br>I remember how close we were in the first two months. In the first year we got an assignment in the English class to describe a friend and I wrote his description and got a special remark from Ma'am for the description. I remember supporting him for the CRs post going to batchmates room asking them to vote for him but things change a lot after the C assignment incident. We were friends and we are still friends. We had our shares of ups and downs, I did not support him much during the Coordinatorship thing and we had our arguments then. I hold major part of the blame but he worked his arse off for the fest he was damn got in sponsorship getting two major sponsors. For me "he is the best CR" and some of the things he has done in the college is truly commendable. Time and again I have not supported you and there were my reasons for it but believe me we all are aware of the work you have done for our batch and for our college. You have been a great friend. You have immense leadership qualities and you have amazing ability to deal with people. I hope you reach great heights.<br>Daddu bhai a sincere thanks for the batch trips<br>and hopefully this one will be a dream trip.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Just look at the interviews which he took from various people in a train on some of his trip (probably Sikkim). It was hilarious man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I can never forget that. I saw it in TV room in NBH. No one in our batch can forget that how often and badly you used to get bashes especially in workspace. The way he narrates stories or incidents is class. He is best at that. Diplomatic at times, but good at heart and very helping I must say. It was he who used to get all the deadlines extended for us. Thanks a lot man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>We have had our share of differences though. In not just one issue, but many of them. For example, I don't like certain things about what he does, things like the amount he exaggerates, the way he sometimes thinks unidimensionally etc. But credit that both of us could put aside those differences and work together. Felicity is a case in point. In spite of the differences, he lent me immense support during the entire festival. I still remember the day when he thought that work for Felicity needed to be speeded up, and came up and told me how to go about doing it. He put in work like only he could have - convincing companies to shell out cash. His suggestions and support during the entire festival were invaluable <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .<br><br>In spite of the screw ups, I enjoyed working under him for the batch trip. Though I guess that experience left him disappointed and he did not invite me for this time's batch trip organization <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He also put in commendable work for our placements, thanks for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Did I also mention his acting and direction talents? I think when it comes to skit play, Anthwal, Chand and he are the best around. His cheesy sense of humour and sarcasm are quite enjoyable.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>My first memories with Sanket date back to the initial few days. There were posts up for grabs, and a lot of us had ambitions for them. Yours truly was one of the hopefuls <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . So a few days before the elections, Chand and I visited Daddu in his room. Now, I wanted to be the cult sec, and hence asked Chand to be the CR. Chand agreed, but there was a huge roadblock. Daddu. He, in his gentle manner absolutely refused to budge from his position, and suggested that we stand for cult sec and cult rep respectively. Finally, he had his way. I remember, he'd won against Pradeep. It showed the kind of popularity he enjoyed even during those days. (Both among the seniors and our batch mates) Those speeches which we made.. Hilarious mate! Australia <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Of course, it goes without saying that Sanket has done a very good job. I think throughout the four years, <i>he</i> has been <i>the</i> CR for both <br>sections. Right from getting assignment deadlines postponed to organising the batch trip to rallying together for a cause to taking attendance in Zulu's classes, he has been brilliant! In fact, hes your quintessential neta. Some time back, Himank, Sharat, Manish and I were discussing on who was the guy in the batch who could easily convince anyone, and Himank's reply was Sanket. I think I coudn't agree more with him. You should have seen him trying to convince <br>Bezawada and Kothapalli in the BTP Viva!

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Daddu, the CR of our batch. A very, very methodical person who, during whatever he does, covers every trick given in the book, and then some more. E.g., the way he talks is very bookish at times, but I think that frees up the mindspace to think of some really creative and devious tricks. You have to listen to the stories of his exploits to believe him - Kota, Jodhpur, the different hair raising trips he has undertaken and so on. The list is quite endless.<br><br>Daddu has been the CR for the past four years, and like him or dislike him, he has worked hard for the batch, and that remains a fact. He has organized trips (although none to Australia <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) where so many of our batchmates have had their glorious moments. Both the batch trips have been planned by him, and even now when people are in retirement mode, Daddu is the one surfing away at his laptop, making phone calls and finetuning details. His work as a placement lead is again something else. All in all, a person who has worked hard for his batch and his friends.<br><br>Being at the center of everything, he has also happened to be at the center of birthday bumps and fun poked at him by our batchmates. Many a times it had been me. But you knew that that was all in good spirit and never took offence.<br><br>Lots of delightful memories associated with him. I sometimes regret not having gone to any major trip with him, and even now our plans to the high mountains seem not to be getting fulfilled. But there's always the future to look forward to. <br><br>There can never be a dull moment when Daddu is around.

To hua yeh hamare saath ek kanya baithi thi ( saath maine uski mummy  bhi thi...) aur hamare daddu ne unhe baithe baithe pata liya... jab tak woh log train maine rahe.. google microsoft se neeche hi nahin utre... yahan tak ki apne bhai to bangalore call bhi kar diya ek bet ke upar.... aur jaise hi woh log train se utre... bande ka first word tha Ch*****... toh aise hai hamare daddu... he knows wat to speak at the right moment <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... <br>inki ek aur acchi baat hai ki yeh kabhi gussa nahin hote ( ya phir gussa dikhate nahin hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )... but chahe kisi ne inke saath kitna bhi bura kiya ho he will not get angry aur hamesha cool rahenge... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> iski presentation dene ka ya phir coding karne (<i>Karwane <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> </i>) ka tareeka is also awesome... Had loads of fun with him during summer project under Kamal... <br>So daddu thank u for being our CR and doing all things u did for us (be it deadline ext. or planning trips... or placement tutorials... [agar maine likhta rahunga to db. bhar jayega but batein khatam nahin hogi..])<br>Message: Sometimes being spontaneous is helpful then being prepared/calculated bec. people may take latter as manipulation. <br>finally, BOFA maine ho to roz milenge hi:</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sanket Sharma aka daddu, I also call him guru <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. What can I say about him!! He is a bond in all kind of managerial stuff. I think he can handle any kind of situation and the outcome will surely be the best. I have been going with him on last 3 trips and it was an unforgettable experience. I have worked with him on a project and it was a life time experience. Every time he comes up with a superb trick to get the things done and every time I see him doing that it was like OMG!!! He is a prefect leader and I m a big fan of him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is also very adventurous and enthusiastic  always ready to go to a new place for sight seeing or some adventure. If u are doing any work with him, he will always be thr encourage u. He can convince any one through a presentation (if u hv gone to any trip along with him then u might know <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). He never hearts anyone's feelings. I think kaafi tareef ho gayi ... now lets come to the main points <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Daddu is always our <i>bakra</i> for bumps, can't forget the days in workspace, when ever we wanted to give bumps, daddu was our first choice <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Waise daddu ki lete bhut hain sabhi log <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Aur daddu kaatne aur katvane mein bhut mahir hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Daddu's trip to Australia is pending <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.. he promised us and daddu never breaks promises <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>Thr are many other things and incidents about daddu that can make all people laugh but I think daddu won't be able to laugh after that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>In the end, I can say that he a good friend and if u want any suggestion then he is the right person. Want to have full masti and an adventurous trip then u can completely trust him. <br><br>Best of Luck for your future and always be the same as u r <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>We are in Hyderabad so I hope u have a lot more trips to plan and I will surely join u. Always be in contact.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>As his name strike in my mind, always a smile flicker on my face. His persona is enough to charm anyone- very humble, down-to-earth *ahem ahem* <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> , and always make everyone comfortable in his company. I think that is the main factor that almost everyone appreciate him.<br>In first year, we only exchanged acquaintances. He was CR, and I wud say "Hi' whenever I meet him, to which he promptly give a humble hand wave. My philosophy says - avoid people who don't make you feel comfortable. In "daddu's" case I always wanted to be in his company right from the first year. But we were hostel-apart till second year, and we usually meet at the mess table. Our friendship started growing more in third year when I shifted to NBH. This was then I started understanding him more clearly. He appreciate u for good things, criticize for bad things to make u bring change in u. It was only then I realised hes Daddu not only by "naam" but by "kaam" also. Mind u He has holidayed in  25 cantries ( whoops countries) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , I hope this number will increment soon. ( with mine too, starting from  nill). On almost everything he can give u advice. It was fun when we started crash tutorials before every exam in my room. Padna toh ek bahana tha. Inko managment skill ke kisse toh sabhi ko maloom hain, no need to recount here. Had some wonderful time with him in Kerala trip, Tripuati. <br>And yeah those time spent in placement preparation will be cherished for long. Aajkal mere ko bike riding k lesson de raha hai...thanks daddu, mein tere armanon mein khara utroonga. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br><b> He is : Impermeable to any bad comment.<br>    My advice : is that never let ur passion dry for fulfilling ur aims.<br>    Song Fit for you: Tere jaise yaar kahan... </b><br>to be continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
