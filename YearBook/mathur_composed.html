<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>3. Music Lover - His taste of music changes as he comes in contact with an individual ... <br>When he and Adi came close his taste changed to rock ... When he and Bhlu came close his taste changed to Beatles kinda music ... And now Coldplay ... Ye taste iski newly made GF ka hai .. (whose name has 7 letters, starts with B ends with A)  <br><br>4. Shopping freak : This bloody ass**** spent almost all 50K that he received from LTRC. His taste changed from local brands to Levis and what not ... aajkal ise local theatres mein jana pasand nahin hai .. sadak chaap desi dukan mein ghusna pasand nahin hai ... lekin banda down to earth hai ... <br><br>5. Movies - Buddhe ko Vivah jaisi movies pasand hain ... Hum Saath Saath Hain is his favourite I believe... Bhai ki hamare group mein sabse pehli shaadi jo hogi ... <br><br>6. Caring - "Buddha" actually came into existence because of this quality. Heused to tell others what to do and what not .. what is good for u .. and blah blah ... Tab se sala Dadaji ban gaya hai ... but he is actually very caring... <br><br>7. Chupa Rustum : Bhai bande ki girl-friend ban gayi hai .. lekin kisiko batata nahin hai ... mind you agr chatting kar raha hoga to room band kar lega... lets no one enter his room when he is busy chating... <br><br>8. Dance - Chora dance bhi bahut badhiya karta hai ... vo bhi gana "Nain lad jayi hai .. balma kasak hoi we mari" ... aur uspe jo Buddhe (MIND YOU BUDDHA) ki kamar lachakti hai ... sare students mujra dekh rahe ho jaise... <br><br>Some more qualities of budhs ... <br>Bears helluva pimple marks on his face... <br>Naak iski phool phool ke pakoda ban gayi hai ... <br>Pigeon chested buddha(as told by chand)... <br><br>and there is more to write ... I think this is enough as of now .. <br><br>Chalo ji bbye <br><br>Best wishes for your MS .. and then future .. <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br><br>Buddha.. Budhs .. Bipul Bhai ... BITCHY(suits him better) ...<br><br>Our road begins from the day 1 I entered the college .. I wanted to be his roomie but some how we couldn't get same room.. blah blah .. <br>So coming on to the point his qualities .. I love this part.. bande mein itni khoobiyan hain ki aadmi likhte likhte thak jaye ... launda heera hai ... koyle ki khaan se taraasha hua heera ... college mein ise hamne hi taraasha aur ab hamari hi leta hai sala kamina ... <br><br>1. Kamina - Log mujhe kehte hain ki main sabse bada kamina hun ... but taking into account his recent activity he overtakes me with a large margin ... Let me describe some of the incidences... <br><br>a)Suppose Chand entered his room ... He wont speak to him .. will wince once twice untill he recognise ... <br><br>b)Maroo enters - <br>Maroo - Hi be <br>Vipul - Hi be .. and then maroo goes bak to his room. <br><br>c) Adi enters <br>Vipul - Hi be adi .. kya chal raha hai ... dikha nahin kai din se .. blah blah blah ... <br>Adi - (Laziness personified) Haan be ... room pe hi tha ... (followed by adi laying down on his bed)<br><br>So If he likes you, you wil notice in an instant otherwise F*** off ... <br><br>2. Working Buddha - Bhaisahab mere prject partner the ... I will remember you for the time we did BC during working hours... So the thing was the time I spent in working the code he used to study the material and later on explaining it to me... <br><br>This part was  bit boring ... <br><br>So coming on to his Drinking capability ... Vipul bhai pe to lete hain bina soche samjhe ki baad mein kya hoga ... aur ten-chaar peg baad chalne ki halat mein nahin rehta ... chaar kandhe vapas le jane ke liye chahiye hote hain ... <br><br>Pine ke baad jo rona chaloo hota ha isala band hi nahin hota ... hadd hai... I cried once after drinking and it felt disgusting .. how do you manage it ?<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 3<br><br>7. AAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLSSSIIIII : this guy can even beat Raman and Adi when he becomes lazy. sala iska room kitna bhi thok lo .. andar se ek hi jawab aana hai ... "Kya hai!!(annoying tone)abe main so raha hun be, baad mein aana."<br>You can rarely find him sitting in his chair, most of the time he would be laying on his bed.<br><br>There is so much I want to say but I cannot write some of those things here in public. <br><br>I will remember you for :<br>DLF <br>Chhat pe BC <br>Daru ki bottles dump karna <br>EPP <br>You ma******ting when you roomie is awake .. effin disgusting !<br>Your IIM rejection and you telling me that I didnt want to tell my parents coz they would disturb me in my sleep. FUCK!<br><br>still not getting things to write down... <br><br>Chalo thats all for now ... <br>Best Wishes for your future ... May you excel with girls in IV Comptech ...<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>3. Activa - This is a fun part for me too... About 2'O clock in the night I have this habit of getting hungry and Bhalu at that time needs his Sutta ... DLF is the right place to be for our needs... ek baar ki baat hai .. main aur ye nikal gaye dlf ke liye ... vapas aate time he told me that he wanted to go on a ride in the night ... I had nothing to do so I agreed.. phir to kya tha .. nikal gaye hum log ... lingampally station se left right left right karte karte kahin pahunche .. and we realised that we were lost... phir socha ki wapas chalna chahiye... matlab we were almost 10 kms away from DLF ... jab vapas aa rahe the tab ek building dikhi... bhalu bhaisaab bolte hain ki abe ye to DLF aa gayi ... I then realised that something was wrong with bhalu ... On our way back he told me that he was on high at that time... This shows that u never know what he is upto ... <br><br>4. Club 8 Parties and his dance step : I will remember u for all the parties we had and your typical dance step that u always do and that made us ROFL ... <br><br>Coming on to other side of Bhalu <br><br>5 Multi-Tasking - Whenever you visit his room .. you can see him <br>chatting to 4-5 "GIRLS" .. phew! <br>listening and maintaining playlists ...<br>using last fm using twitter ...<br>Phone pe msging .. <br>sutta ...<br>ETC ... <br>In all limitless BC karta hai ye banda ... BC is an integral part of him ... koi bhi arbit site hogi and he is not registered to it, is a rare case. <br><br>Be it forum or Lifeinlines or gmail pe bc ... Bhalu stands out evryone ... <br><br>6 Intelligence : Ab ye to sabhi ko pata hai kitna intelligent hai ye banda ... He has a thing for numbers ... evryone says he gets aroused by them. So he is our calculator whenever we try to settle down the figures of any trip. <br><br>One more Incidence that proves this point - <br>When I visited his home in Dehradun I was shocked to see how many effin medals he won ... Aunty told me that he used to be outstanding in classes in school.. I was so tempt by this and I so much wanted to say this "Aunty now he stands out in class" <img src=Smileys/24.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>PART 1<br><br><br>Our Dear Bhalu ... mota bhalu .. jhaantu bhalu... annoying bhalu .. bhalu re bhalu ... and One of my "best" friend in college ...<br><br>I am not exactly getting it how we met, but I guess I used to come in cellar and we must have met there it seems. <br>So I'll start off when we actually became good frens... As far as I can remember our road begins in second sem and is still going on a neverending journey .. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>So some of incidences which describes bhalesh :<br><br>1.  Sale ko daru kabhi nahin chadhti... tanki hai .. kitni bhi pila do ... I remember the night jab mere room pe daru pi thi ... Mujhe chadh chuki thi ... and then jab main kuch khulase karne laga tab sala bola hai sabko ki "abe chup chup, mathur kuch bolne vala hai" ... mujhe bolne par majboor kiya sale ne... and I still regret what happnd that night ... This shows his KAMINAPAN <br><br>2. Annoying Bhalu ... mere room pe aata hai .. khidki khuli hui hai to zor se band karega ... agar band hai to khol ke band karega ... and I have this thing of getting RED time to time ... he makes full use of it ... jab bhi milta hai tab ya to gaal khichega ya chuuti bharega ya kanga se kuch karega ... hadd hai .. ye sab ke liye main hi milta hun kya ... this shows his ANNOYING quality ...<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
