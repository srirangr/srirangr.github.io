He said we have time to properly aim for our goal in life, while others have already taken their first shot in life by joining the company!<br>Looking at him one doesn't have to think two times to decide that he's from Rajasthan.<br>He's a very wise person but prefers to use his wisdom in this he pleases. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! waise hum toh 1 saal abhi yaheen hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

He has opened a site as well related to MBA preparation which is doing really good and is quite a nice and intelligently made site. What I admire in this guy is his straightforwardness. I remember that in front of jury which sat to investigate the fighting between 2k5 and 2k6, when everyone was telling lies(I wasn't fighting, I wasn't involved etc), is bande ne seena thok kar bola tha ... "haan maine maara tha, maa ch***o ". bcbaaz to hai hi bahut bade vala.

Hum log jab bhi milte hain, hamari hi-hello gaaliyon se hi hoti hai. Hua aisa tha ki isne ek baar 2 din ka maunvrat kiya tha aur jab mujhe pata chala, to maine is bande ko itni jyada gaaliyan di thi ki bas, iske usse bahar aane par ye silsila chalu ho gaya aur abhi tak chalta aa raha hai aur aage bhi chalega <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We organized equity pulse together along with Paro, Banga, Ankush and Daddu. I must say that he is a good organizer as well as a good manager. Peeche pad jaata tha, chal-chal, aaj to ye kaam kar ke hi rahenge. I must say that his knowledge of share market is class. I got to learn a lot from him during that time. Then we took SE presentation together. It was hell lot of fun. Remember that Dr Verma thing and that Valentine day thing <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Banda awesome blogger hai. Ek hi article likha isne aur us time IIIT ka sabse popular blogger ban gaya <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Pyaar to bande ko har mod par ho jata hai. Saala dil-fenk aadmi hai. Ek baar canteen par baithe the aur kuch bandiyan jo gachibowli stadium mein aayi hui thi, they came. Bolta yaar mujhe is bandi se pyaar ho gaya hai. Fir thodi der baad ek aur bandi aayi, mr mahaveer "abe ye bhi mast hai yaar, mujhe isse bhi pyaar ho gaya hai" .... i was like wtf !! kuch bhi. This guy is damn witty and funny. Iske saath baith kar kabhi bore nahi ho sakte. Aur jab lene par aata hai to gandi maar leta hai. A damn good cricketer, very sharp sportsperson, bande ko samajh mein aa jata hai ki saamne vala banda kya karne vala hai ya saamne vali team ko kaise confuse kiya ja sakta hai and the clear example is volleyball. My FIFA guru. mujhe FIFA khelna isi ne sikhaya hai .... thanks a lot for that buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. But ab ye kameena ho gaya hai .... ab main jab bhi khelne ko bolta hun to mana kar deta hai, bolta hai ki ab main FIFA'09 khelta hun ...

Mahaveer, on the other hand, always stood first and that too maintaining a huge difference between him and the next user. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Later I came to know that this guy used to sit for hours and gather information about the shares that he's going to buy and then take a decision. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your dedication bro.<br><br>Coming to the sports arena. He's left hander batsman and right from my childhood days, I've never seen anyone hitting so powerful shots in his batting. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Also, Mahaveer is an awesome fielder. Once I saw him throwing the ball just when it reached his hand (left), without even looking at the stumps. Bingo! A direct hit. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He plays football too.<br><br>All the very best for your future buddy and never forget me. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mahaveer bhai.. Over the past few years, we've had a decent level of friendship except for one incident, which changed it all. <br><br>Cricket has been the unifying factor for us over the past few years. I have played under many captains in IIIT, but I have no hesitation in calling him one of the best captains I've played under. He is so proactive with his decision making and so encouraging for the lesser players (which I was). I still remember the kind of support and encouragement he gave me in second year, and included me in the batch team <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . It was my bad that I screwed up the chance back then. He has one of the sharpest sporting brains on his shoulders and has always been one of the core members of the team. Even in a sport like volleyball, something which he'd not played much, he transformed his inexperienced team into a winning one.<br><br>It is so unfortunate that our skirmish also took place thanks to cricket. Now thats wrong on my part- blaming cricket, I think it was ego which came in between the relationship. But well, things got better, and we had a talk in the daroo treat from juniors. And I hope we're on decent terms now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Apart from these, I'll remember Veer for his post on IIIT girls (It was hilarious <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ), the mentor that he has been for UG2K7, his amazing sense of humour, our common levels of desperation <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , Marwari, ragging, the good work he put in for Felicity, the ideas and plans he has for the college.. He is one person who <i>always</i> has my respect for following his heart and principles. What I dont like about him is the moody nature and the kind of ego.<br><br>Wish you all the very best in life mate! May God bless! Really hope that we do stay in touch.<br><br><b>Fav memory: You encouraging me during practice sessions.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

But, I really liked his decision to complete his MS under K.Shrinathan Sir. Pls jab bhi teri MS presentation ho, mujhe jaroor bulana.<br><br>We have been together since first years. We were among the first persons in our batch, who gave the ragging. He took me to the gym, and within a mintue we found ourselves surrounded by the seniors. I still remember the way, isne seniors ka ragging mein kaata tha. He made them extremely senti by saying that he belongs to a village and is very poor. He has never seen a TV. I was really laughing on the seniors that time, bechaare. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>We had lots of outings during first two years, then (I still don't know the reason) he suddenly stopped talking, go outside with us. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But since we are in Batch Cricket team, I am always in touch with him.<br><br>The most dedicated person in sports I have seen in past 4 years <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Koi bhi match ho, ya practice ho, hamesha field pe dikh jaata hai. He is a very good cricketer. A gifted batsman and a reasonably good bowler and fielder. <br>He helped me a lot in becoming a good fielder, gave me a dozen of catches.  <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Plays Chess very well too. Although I won the first of our 2 encounters, but since than he has won lots of them <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> But ek baar Inter House mein ek fachche se haar gaya tha, khoob gaali diya tha tab main isko <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Apart from this, he is an active orgaiser. He worked a lot on the Equity Pulse during Felicity'08. ALso organised various cricket tounaments during carnival. IPL was a big hit.<br><br>Most of the times, he is seen with juniors. He is like an idol for them. I appreciate his bold nature to speak whatever he feels and to stand on his point. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>All the best Veer fro your future.

<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mahaveer aka dulla <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. is the best sports person I hv ever seen in school or college. He can play any game and also plays them really well. He is a big fan of soccer, u can often see him choosing a soccer team on a website(but he is really bad at that .. always chooses a bad team <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>His best time pass is celebrating New Year <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The best thing I like about him is the way he can speak out about his feeling towards any person ..it can be good or bad. He will say what he thinks about u or anybody <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is very generous and caring of nature .. he always keeps me telling new ways abt how to become fat <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>I think he is the only person who has guts to fight and is never afraid of anybody. He is the man of his words <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and sticks to what he has said or done.<br><br>He has rearly talked to any girl in our college so humari trhaan he frastu hai .... but don't think that he is the same in his past life .. He has shared some of the experiences with me in which he was like a hero .. every beautiful girl of his town and in Kota had a crush on him .. after hearing all the incidents I was like wtf!!! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ... how can a girl had a crush on him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Aaj kal jyada ladkiyon ko bhaav nahi deta nahi to college mein bhi GKB ki jga aaj mahaveer ka naam hota <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is the favourate among 2nd year guys .. so we also call him FKD ... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>The best thing I like abt him is the sense of humour he has ... he can make up the things really fast and I m sure that will make you laugh your ass off <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and won't let u feel bored of a single minute. He also dedicated person .. does the things that he likes to do .. except studies <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... with full dedication ...always a source of inspiration for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Always be like what you are ... and be as friendly as u are even after we leave the college. Best of Luck for rest of ur life .. hope u will complete ur MS with in next year. Always be in touch .. we will have dinner in Ohri's Banjara every weekends after I join the company <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.... and don't worry I will sponsor them <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
