<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>First thing I remember of him is that he's good at playing cricket. I met him a lot in my third year when I went to live at his floor. I had good time with him playing corridor cricket.<br>He insisted I be his team mate in Software Engineering and I am glad about that. I had real good time while making the video for the presentation !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Next thing, when we played TT together, he always took me in his team and although I suck at TT, he plays so well that we used to win most of the time! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I really had a good time with you, I'm sure the vice-versa is also true. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for the future, I'm sure it'll be better but not as these college days!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Rishi aka Rissi aka cooldude<br><br>Let me start with the best memory with this guy: I was in train travelling from AP Express from Delhi to Hyderabad and I got a call from this guy .... "Manish bhai, mera placement ho gaya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .... kaha tha na sabse pehle tujhe call karunga, to sabse pehle tujhe hi bata raha hun" .... I was really happy for his placement and for me, that gesture of his' was really touching <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Thanks a lot for that mate. I can never forget that phone call in my whole life.<br><br>Initially is bande se kabhi kuch interaction nahi hua, but fourth year mein jaisi friendship hui hai, that has seriously given me a very good friend for my whole life. Start hua TT se jab Gupta, main aur ye ghanto TT khelte rehte the aur fir humne saath mein CS bhi khelna shuru kar diya aur ye kabhi kabhi volleyball mein bhi aa jaata tha. This guy, as his name(cooldude) is, extremely cool. Bahut hi pyaar se baat karta hai. A quick learner. That can clearly be seen from his TT skills. I have learnt patience from him. TT mein har baar return karta hai chahe vo point kitna hi lamba chale, aisa kabhi hote hue nahi dekha ki frustaa kar kuch galat shot khel le. Kameena hamesha mujhse singles mein jeet jata hai .... thode time ruk ja beta tu, tujhe main bataunga <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Felicity ki finance council mein bhi tha and he did an extremely good job. Keep rocking dude. Apan to hyd mein hi hain, to milte hi rahenge. All the best for all your future endeavours <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mera Ajmeri bhai, Rishi has been a very good friend of mine. Bhai hamesha AC se travel karte the aur hum hamesha sleeper se. Garmi mein itna gussa aata tha ki use train se bahar phek ke uski jagah chala jaun <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But I used to go to his compartment and stay there for a long time.<br><br>Has been a very good cricket player and maintained a decent CG. His work for the finance council during the Felicity was exemplary. Very hard working and friendly to its core. Being parts of two different groups we have not talked much during the 4 years but it hardly matters because I know we are very good friends and he'll always be there whenever I'll need him.<br><br>I just hope you make it something big in near future. Good luck. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Rishi aka cooldude.<br><br><b>Trivia:</b> He is the guy who along with Sachin gave me the name DJ Ranga which became popular in a few hours and even today people call me with the same name. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me famous. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He's smart, he's dangerous at times but most importantly he's very matured and behaves highly rational. Handling monetory affairs properly is like hie fav job. He'd never say no to do that job.<br><br>Also, he's an awesome fielder. A very dedicated sportsman on the field.<br><br>Keep rocking buddy.

<b><a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Our interactions for the first 2 years have been mostly on the ground and a just Hi off it.... and then came felicity... where we are in the felicity finance dept and I must say without him finance wouldnt have been handled with such an ease. He is good at planning and effing strict which I cannot exactly follow. <br><br>Yes there are moments where I got pissed of him but yes in an institution, differences are bound to creep in but we never did allow it to harm the fest nor our relationship. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>An awesome fielder, without which this testi would be completely incomplete. I must say that his contribution in the fielding dept is most vital for all the wins which we have managed to pull off. Be it awesome catching or the powerful throw, we are assured of the best possible commitment from him in the field. Buddy will surely miss you when I enter the ground next year.....<br><br>all the very best for your future,<br>stay in touch for sure,<br><br>cheers,<br>rohit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Rishig aka Chota GupTHA  -  My ex-Roomy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>The very first person I met after coming to IIIT. I was sitting in room no. 305 with my guardians waiting for admission. I looked behind and saw rajasthan on his mark sheet. Then we talked first time and became roommates. I still remember he asked me that day ..we'll play basketball to increase our height <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . In first 3 years we have spent lot of time together. Pro of leg pulling , and I used to be a default victim for him <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . He is really sincere for studies. First 3 years he used to be very regular for classes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, but 4th yr me most of the time ghar bhag jata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Bahut logo ko padhaya hai isne. He doesn't look sporty but one of the most sports activists of our batch. So has been a member of batch cricket n football team. He was the first one, who got a laptop in our group. To room me almost daily movie screening hoti thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Playing pocket tank, Rodrash in early days was so much fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .Banda room ko ekdum saaf rakhta hai.. 1st yr me kabhi mujhe room saf karane ki naubat nahi aayi. I still miss u for that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Hisab kitab ek dum clear rakhta hai. so most of the time hisab kitab ka kam ise he pakda diya jata hai. And islie IIIT financial council ka member bhi bna diya <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Jab phone ghar par bat karta hai .. then no one can believe that he is d same guy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. aisa lagta hai jaise pori dunia me isse sincere banda or koi nahi hai.<br>His behavior changes according to his mood. Kabhi bahut softly bat karega kabhi bahut rude :x .. n a few of times I used to lost my temper due to his rude behavior. He doesn't let himself flow in emotions, knows very well to use his mind. He knows very well what he have to do or what not to do. <br><br>So many memories of NBH 3rd floor r cherished in my mind. However it was <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , being with you was really fun. Wish you good luck for ur future. May god give u whatever u wish in ur life. Keep in touch. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And yeah I won't forget u, hope u too <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Rishi, one of the last 4 member of vizag batch-trip. Enjoyed the trip at most. I think we really rocked that thing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All those memories are still fresh and brings smile to my face remembering the incidents we had done in that trip <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Sits near me in the class and makes class less painful for me. Saved me from lots of torture during 4th sem/5th sem <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>	Whenever we go for outing, he quickly calculates the expenses and informs with you by mail titled "AAJ KA HISAAB" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Been in the financial council , worked very hard for that, Hamesha laga rehta tha. Even during felicty''08 when all of are dancing, he was at T-shirt counter <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. This shows his sincerity and dedication for the work he take.He is often blunt and thats why we have a ball while pulling legs <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, yh but when you are at receiving end you don't stop cursing him :x :x Other thing about him is isko <b>"feel"</b> badi jaldi aati hain <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, yh another thing which he is (in)famous among us is his swinigng mood. One second He talks to you all patiently and calmly, but suddenly turns into a shouting violent guy <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>		He is sincere and punctual to classes (Not any more).  Listens to prof. and even maintains notes of the same while playing BOLLYWOOD/HOLLYWOOD with us <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> During exam time he goes mad. Din bhar padhta rehta hain. Hardly comes out for BC. But then humko pda bhi deta hain <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. We had taken many courses together after 4th sem. Maths ke toh saare courses yahin pdata hain <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .Itni fast+accurate maths maine kisi ki nahin dekhi. During placement when we were just reading aptitude question , bhai sahab ka answer ready rehta tha <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>	I enjoyed playing cachein and kode konundrum in 3rd floor. We were among toppers in both of them last year <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .His way of solving puzzles is mindblowing <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .  Plays Cricket, TT and Football very well. Its better to be in his team. He always score enough runs for your team to win <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Even in Bball, pta nahin kahan se bhaag ke aa jaata hain , ball ke liye. His speed and stamina is mind blowing <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />  <b> 29</b> mein toh banda 20 se kaam kabhi bolta hi nahin, agar saamne wala bole toh double/redouble kar deta.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>Placements saw him (along with Bansi and Gupta) come much closer to our group. Adversity increased the bonding in the batch. I remember the amount of work this chap had put in. I'll also remember that I was the first one to give him a hug after he got placed. It was a fab moment, especially after all that he'd gone <br>through. <br><br>The other things I'll remember about Rishi- watching cricket together; the way he says "Bharat" instead of India <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ; the zoo trip with him; batch trip in 2nd year; meals together in the mess; leofying people together and getting leofied etc. And yep, I'd certainly remember him as the person "capable of doing anything" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the very best in life!<br><br><b><br>Person he resembles: Micheal Bevan<br>Fav memory: His reassurance to me after the Indian Ocean fiasco<br>Message for him: Chak de phatte!<br></b><br><br>Peace.<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>In the future whenever I'd think of Rishi, I'm sure the first thing which'll come to mind is the smile. The constant smile and the chillax attitude makes him one of the coolest persons around. Always relaxed, people are often scared ki "Rishi sabke saath mil ke unki le lega" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is undoubtedly a pro at pulling your leg <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>I'll also remember Rishi for being a man for all seasons. Koi bhi event ho, you just need to call him for help. He'll be there. I remember, when we were asked to submit names for the finance council. I thought of Rishi and went and asked him. He was like, "Maroo, tu jo kaam dega, mein woh sambhal lunga." It was awesome to have just dedication for the festival! And needless to mention, he was brilliant when it came to handling finances. He was fairly strict with <br>the finances, and we could never take him for granted. He kept us on our toes throughout, be it collecting money, making budgets or whatever. And at the time of the "Indian Ocean crisis", he was sane enough to not only keep his cool and rebudget the entire thing (with Rohit and Aditya), but also assure me, "Maroo <br>to chinta mat kar. Hum sambhal lenge, tu baaki saare chize dekh". The amount of reassurance I got from that one statement from Rishi was enough to carry me through all of the second day (after the nightmare of a first night)  Mate, hats off for all the work for Felicity '08 <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Rishi is also a good cricketer and footballer. Both of us have had similar fortunes in the Aakash and batch cricket teams- in and out in the first two years, but into the respective opening roles from the third year. Though he has a limited footwork, he has often provided good starts to the team, including the epic match against UG2K6. Add to his batting his brilliant fielding, and you have a very good cricketer. Of course, I can never forget IBCT 2008 and our <br>victory <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
