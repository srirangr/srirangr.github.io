<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Aksay aka Ganja aka RBC aka Stud aka Loverboy aka Shrikant</u><br><br>Ganja bhai used to be my frustration partner in first year, when both of us used to crib about our roomies who used to frustrate us a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One of my closest friend in IIIT. We were quite the closest friends in first year. All those long walks of campus we used to undertake, those were just awesome. I will never be able to forget all those things. We sort of drifted apart later due to various factors, still being close friends but not the friends we were back in 1st year. But ab to sath mein flat le rahe hain, its gonna be one hell of a time we are gonna spend <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Sorry for not being able to write a proper one. I promise I will write one for you <br><br><b>Song for you : Hum hain seedhe sadhe Aksay Aksay</b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He was my hi hello friend till before I participated in the photo walk with him this semester.<br>All I knew about him is that he is called Ganja because he got rid of hair on his head and that he plays basketball very well.<br>During the photowalk, he suggested me to take a snap of whatever I found nice. When he saw me standing like a dumb guy taking pictures in a clueless manner he came to me and showed me some nice ways of using the camera while taking a pic. The photowalk was great. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I still think that P K Singh and Shrikant look so similar! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Shrikant aka ganja aka Aksay kumar<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...<br><br>Expressing this guy is like saying many cool and bindas words one by one. He is the hell of an interesting personality<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. This smart and dashing guy from Aazamgad is one of the best persons to spend time with. He got stunning looks coupled with a dude hairstyle. His dressing sense is always been appreciable. <br><br>Isliye hum log is bande ka tanka har bandi se jod dete<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> hai aur ishi karan we call him Aksay kumar<img src=Smileys/24.gif /> instead of Akshay because he is from a village.<br><br>He wasn't quite good at studies but he worked his arse off and managed to get a very good job that is a remarkable achievement indeed<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He did many things for IIIT like played for basketball's college team, played a vital role in felicity 09 and also started a new culture of photography<img src=Smileys/26.gif />. He becomes very active when he got his camera in his hand and starts to capture every mobile moments. <br><br>I had share lots of funny memories with him. We shared same wing through out our four year. He's been a very good pal for me, except for some moments when we din't want to see each other faces<img src=Smileys/14.gif />. I don't understand why it happens but after some time we starts talking to each other and I think this special characteristics makes our friendship stronger<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. I would definitely miss you a lot but as you will be here in hyderabad, we'll have lot more fun together.<br><br>Best of luck for your future!!!<br>Will keep in touch with you definitely!!!       <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>He likes being surrounded by friends, enjoys their company. However, he hardly ever opens up except with his very close friends. Personally, I've never been close to him.<br><br>And yeah.. Who can forget his legendary voice? He has to be the loudest in the batch, I remember that occasion when both of us screamed out from the terrace and Pagare messaged back immediately <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . It was fun, wasn't it?  Hes famous for doing that regularly in his wing!<br><br>I often have a feeling that he is stuck in his own utopian world, with a lot of art and girls <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Most of the times, dreamy is his state of mind. Once again, its all artistic instincts. I can so very well imagine him living only with his girl in an island- painting away to glory! But he, like all of us, also likes attention, a pointer comes from all the "aksay" like acts he does <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Other memories with him include leofying him (SNS), screaming together <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , begging of him to click my pics- only to be denied every time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , discussing all the places where he's lived, roomie discussions <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..<br><br>Couple of more things which I <i>truly</i> appreciate about him- his resilience and his ability to keep his cool under pressure.<br><br>Wish you all the very best in life!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Akshay Kumar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: Screaming together from the rooftop.<br>Message for him: Find you calling in life, you are not someone who should go with the flow. </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Shrikant bhai, another of my cellar and group mates <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Like many others, our story started with the marathon outing in the first year. He was Shashank's roomie, and I remember studying together for a few exams back then. This asshole was(is) a kaamchor, would never work for his subjects. That has long been the case, and here I'd make a mention about his passions. He is a very passionate person, drowns himself completely in the thing hes doing, oblivious to the surroundings around him. It was the guitar earlier, and is photography now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He takes so many photos from such weird angles, you have to look at them! I remember Himank, Vipul and I were leofying him for this left, right and center once <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We took pics of lots of things and told him that he a was no better than us <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Poor chap!<br><br>The fact about photographs and the work he put in for Kalakshetra (more about that later) makes me feel that he is an artist by heart- loves to appreciate and be involved in art. He cannot live without the artistic fodder. Here I'd like to suggest him that he should find a true passion which you want to pursue throughout your life. If you know that the technical line is not your calling and something else is, you've got to listen to your heart. <br><br>Now about Kalakshetra. Ganja put in some brilliant work for Kalakshetra '08; frankly, he took upon the kind of responsibility which I did not expect him to. He would run around buying stuff, arranging things, coordinating with people- and did it all wonderfully well. It showed the things he could achieve with dedication.<br><br>(continued..)<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part2 </b><br><br>       The breakfast outing of ours, where everything was so unplanned and we went all the way ending up drinking watermelon juice and paying a forture for that, all the amazing chats we have had, <i>leofying</i> sessions in EPP class, ahh..I <b>am</b> going to miss all these like hell! I am sure I have hurt you in many ways than I think I did for my own ignorance, my hearfelt apologies for the same. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>    He is the friend of a lifetime. I from my part am sure that I will never forget him and will always be there for him [the way they say in the title track of FRIENDS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ]and I hope he will be there for me. And hell, Why won't he? We are such great friends!<br> <br>    Wishing you truck loads of good luck and happiness <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>part 1</b><br><br>     Oh, I have given this fellow so many names, I have pissed him off for so many reasons, and it is so easy to annoy him and pull his leg - just tease him with <b>some</b> girl <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, and there you go!<br><br>      I myself was not an extrovert initially and add to it the fact that this fellow was one of the most silent guys in first year, probably always stuck in his fantasy world <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, I still wonder how we have become such great friends that we are right now! We have changed so much as compared to the way we were in the first year but our friendship is as sweet as it was initially.  With Shrikant, it has always been quite comfortable from the first time we started talking in the first year. Came second year and  we started sharing some of the deepest secrets with each other and it is always great to talk to him and hang out with him. He is one of the very few friends of mine with whom I share my thoughts, without a second thought. It is just easy, for some reason, words start flowing smoothly when talking to him. I can be myself, do all the swearing I do, never once thinking twice if doing so will make him go all judgemental about me. A great listener that he is, combined with his matured thinking, he has bailed me out of some of my most difficult times and I am grateful to him for that. I take the honour of being one of the very few people on whom he confided some his very personal thoughts.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>     He is a guy with quite sensible dress sense, great physique, loves reading fiction, watching a lot of movies, has a passion for photography and pursues it quite seriously <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> and a guy as lazy as the laziest living being on earth. So lazy that he cannot lift his hand and pick up his cell phone and call me when I got hurt, so lazy that he cannot move his butt from his comfy room to see me when I came back from hospital <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, so lazy that he does not even go and meet his own professor for his own grades!! I hope you still have that cute mug I gave you. Trust me, I searched like hell to find such a cute piece<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ganja <br><br>Man with many names. Just to name a few "Ganja", Aksay, Takla ... and list goes on and on. Everyday he has a new name. According to me<br>he is best looking guy in our batch. I have leofied him the most. But he never got irritated, except once. I remember the incident near felicity stage. I seriously went overboard, he got so irritated he threw my shoes in the puddle of mud <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Ganja and I have had some really memorable outings, the sutta sessions we had together. I so wanted him to be placed, I gave him my lucky charm and I am sure "He" was with you when you got placed. Ganja is damn creative.<br>He is the photographer of our group. You can always find pics of arbit thigs like glasses, spoons etc in our outings pics. He was awesome in Felicity. The way he managed the whole Kalakshetra is commendable!<br>He has been leaving in hostel from 8th class and he is so adjusted to the hostel life. He is so calm and composed I never seen him angry, again<br>except once, remember the Goa trip when me, Bhalu and others were talking loud at night and he bursted at us, we couldn't hold our self laughing.<br>I will never forget the "Aksay Kumar" jokes and it is only because he made all those moments so special. When the situation demands he can act very pragmatically. He was directionless for the first two years. Hardly saw him with books, all I remember of him is , him watching movies. He managed well in the end. I am proud of you! We share a special equation.<br>I have enjoyed a lot in your company, be it long bike rides, the jokes or arbit BC sessions with a sutta in our hand.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Some Memories- the whole Aksay Kumar Episode, Coming up with new names,long bike rides, our first long walk in second year, the goa trip,the whole insomnia epsisode,DBMS project,whole roommate thingy<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/10.gif />, leofying you all the time, playing dart game in your room, the "names of Ganja thread" in orkut, all the BCs we had with a sutta in hand.<br>Aksay bhai we had some freaking awesome moments together! Thanks for being there.I sincerely hope that you achieve things that you have set out for, remember your wishlist.<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br><br>He used to play guitar as well but he has stopped it now. I don't know why. I think you should continue with that if you still like doing that. It's not always difficult to find some time for some hobby. Vaise, main jab bhi iske room par jata hun, to guitar uthakar baith jata hun. This guy is a very good basketball player as well. Iske saath TT khelne mein bhi khoob maza aata hai. I think when he is high on his confidence, he plays really awesome but sometimes, I don't know why, he looses confidence aur us time, isse bura bhi koi nahi khel sakta. Dude, I think you should remain confident about whatever you do. I know that you have the potential to do anything perfectly but I think you don't know that and I'm giving it a try through this testimonial to make you realize that. Remain confident always and the success will be yours. This guy shows a lot of patience during placements and got a good result. I think I need to learn that from him coz when it comes to such things, I'm very-2 less patient. He is a good organizer as well. I think a very few clubs are functioning properly here and photography club is one of those whose coordinator is this guy. He also organized Kalakshetra in last Felicity and it was a big success. I wish you luck for your future buddy. May God bestow His showers of blessings upon you. We'll remain in touch of course. Dono hi Hyd mein hain and we are definetly going to enjoy a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br><br>Shrikant aka Ganja aka Aksay (not Akshay) aka ..... a long list it is (just like mine <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> )<br><br>This guy is the photographer of our work. He has immense passion for photography and clicks some real good pics. But main iski khoob leta hun, kahin bhi kisi bhi choti choti ya ajeeb ajeeb cheezon ki ajeeb ajeeb angles se photo leta hua dikh jata hai and I don't understand even a bit in that. But when outcome comes, I must say that I have to appreciate that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Cool banda hai, kabhi ise jyada tension lete hue nahi dekha padhai vagarah ki. Meri tarah fatte maarte hai, isiliye hamari company mein kai baar doosre logon ko kafi baatein samajh mein nahi aati jo sirf hamein hi aati hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I like doing BC with him. Then, we both like FRIENDS a lot. Jab bhi bore ho rahe hote hain, aur ye mere room par aata hai to hum koi na koi FRIENDS ka episode laga kar baith jaate hain aur fir baithe rehte hain kafi-2 der tak. He is famous for shouting as well. Actually, his voice is a bit loud, to hum iski is baat par khoob maarte hain. Aur ye bhi chillane ke liye koi na koi bahana dhoondta hi rehta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Most of the times, we do BC in Adi's room. He has a passion for cars as well. Banda apna Casanova hai. Blog par likhta hai, "I think girls like me" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Ye to mazak ki baat hui, but I think that this should be true as well <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( haan-haan, khush ho ja <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). <br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first met him in Kanpur where we were in the same coaching institute for IIT preparation. He generally used to come wearing a tshirt having a shoe design hanging from his shoulder<img src=Smileys/1.gif />(i still remember that). He used to just sit in the front and believe or not i never saw this guy studying hard<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> not even in the last 4 years<img src=Smileys/1.gif />in college (but he always get good grades..i donno how<img src=Smileys/7.gif />) and thats why when i saw him in IIIT on the first day in room no.119, i was surprized and said "Abe tu??...tu yahaan??"<img src=Smileys/4.gif />...but overall he's a very talented guy<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's good in photography, loves reading novels and doing BC etc<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>..Well u got a nice job u deserved and i wish you Best of Luck for Everthing!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Has immense passion for photography and takes some really nice pics. Just give him a camera in any situation and his magic clicks will produce some really beautiful snaps. The enthusiasm with which he worked as a coordinator of Photography Club and organized those photowalks was commendable. Also did a great job in Felicity'08 in Kalakshetra and the campus decoration part <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>He is one of the founding members(along with Mota) of the constant machaana in our wing <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Has really loud voice, a loud speaker I must say and when he shouts the voice keeps echoing in hostel for hours and sounds more like an Aakashwani. Doesn't need a phone to talk to his family members, his voice is enough. Always ready to do BC and even crack some really weird phattes which no else can really make out <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Does get angry sometimes when someone tries to give him bumps and responds with his famous line 'Dhar ke dunga' <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. A person who is really pure at heart and never keeps ill-feeling against someone. <br>Quite mature and knows exactly what to say to whom so as not to hurt anyone.<br><br>We have had lots of memorable moments in college like basketball matches in evening, little skirmishes on court over some fouls, numerous outings (especially in October in 1st sem), BC sessions in NBH-47 and 270s wing, attending Literature and CAT classes in 6th sem (Bhaagooo ..... <img src=Smileys/21.gif />), composing songs in his room in 7th sem (Badhal Ganj se aaya Ganja ... dhik-chik dhik-chik dhaye-dhaye <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ), placements, club 8 outings (kela incident) and many more.<br><br>It feels really great to have a friend like you. All the best Ganje for your future. God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav Memory</b> - Club 8 outing last month.<br><b>Message for you</b> - Don't give up easily when you do a task, try your best.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Shrikant aka Ganja aka 'Aksay' Kumar aka Nagraj aka SNS .... and the list goes on . Vaise to hai iske naam anek fir bhi ye hai hazaaro mein ek <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>In the first sem he was just a guy from Gorakhpur living in cellar who was Shashank's roomy. At that time we had very few conversations and that too were mainly when we went for an outing or while playing basketball. But with us sharing the same wing after coming to OBH we got to know more of each other and the bond of our friendship became stronger.  <br>Was one of my first basketball buddy. He learnt this game after coming to college and now I must say he is quite good at it (especially faking his opponents). A total bindaas guy who never worries about things much, especially acads and one can see him going for marathon movie sessions just a day before exams. <br><br>He is the one guy in our group who is being made fun of the most <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and he never feels bad about it. Always has a smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> which is really good to see. Probably has more nicknames (around 25 when we counted the last time) than any other person of our batch and his t-shirts, hair density and most importantly his tashan have contributed a lot in giving him those names. Considers himself  'Aksay' Kumar (the real action hero) of our batch <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, due to which he hot the knick - Ganja Pandey and has this dream of jumping from one roof top to another of our college buildings. Got a new nick - Hairy-man <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, who uses hair as his superpower and is much stronger than Spider-man.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>Looks like Aksay (Note: its not Akshaye its <b>Aksay</b>). Says <b> "Dhar ke doonga"</b> (in MithunDa style), bull shitter <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. thinks he <b>plays BasketBall</b>, but actually he's not good at it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Plays <b>guitar</b> as well (Bah! Kabhi mat sunna .. bakwaas guitar hai .. usse bhi jyaada bakwaas bajata hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). cracks awesome <b>jokes</b> (ab tak to samajh hi gaye honge.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Achi <b>photography</b> karta hai (nai ... sachi me ache pics leta hai..). <u>Padhta</u> bhi hai (ganja aur padhai ... lol <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). <b>Novels</b> bhi padhta hai (ab ye to bhai sach hai..), dance bahut awesome karta hai(espesially DJ night me). Khoob <b>masti</b> bhi karta hai (meri tarah). College ki ek bhi bandi aisi nahi hogi jo ispar <b>fida</b> na ho (ab itni saari qualities ho to bandiyan to fida hogi hii <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). <b>Hero</b> hai hero! <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br><br>But in all these 4 years, there's only this guy to whom I spoke my heart out and he listened to me patiently, gave advices at times what to do and what not to do. Whenever I felt bored/depressed I used to go to his room, even in 1st and 2nd years, blurted out all crappy things and he diverted my attention to new comedy  movies, books, TV series and made me happy. Its a very difficult job to make somebody;s mood and you carried it out perfectly buddy <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I bow to thee. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Well, its not the only case, even he came to my room many a times. And yeah Remember my doors are always open for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. When I got placed, I went to his room. He saw me and with a smile said "Awesome! You got placed". I still don;t know how did he tell it. I feel that my BTech without Shrikant is incomplete, void, a dark black patch on a pure white cloth. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I've met sooooo many people in my life but never a guy like Shrikant. Cool, handsome and at the same time down to earth. Never says NO to any of my requests. Always ready to hear any of my fattas (Well, I don;t crack many)<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Always ready to go out for a walk. Always ready to listen to any crap I say. Always ready to come to coffeeshop. Always ready to watch a movie with me. Always ready to go to Indranagar. Always ready to help me. Always ready to help anyone. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br><br>In the beginning I just knew that a guy from Gorakhpur will be sharing PC with me in workspace. He never complained about anything. I even played pranks with him by creating some fake orkut accounts and all that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But he never got angry with me anytime. I cannot forget the time we've spent in English classes, for that matter any class. It was awesome. We had a ball. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br><br>I used to visit his room for all the food he brought from home. He didn;t like that amla murabba and I used to visit his room daily till I was done with it.<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Infact there was a time when, whenever I went to NBH, a visit to his room was must. And it was him through whom I interacted with the TB gang. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This is the third time I am writing this testimonail .. thanks to the power cuts and 0 UPS backup <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Anyways .... <br><br><br>This guys is a huge movie buff and tech-news  freak <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ! He got addicted to his lappy in 2nd year. When we were in cellar, he used to be in his room either reading something on slashdot or watching yet another movie!. It was also the year when shriku and me were ITWS project partners. I remember the hilarios meetings which we had with our mentor <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Most of the meetings used to clash with his basketball timings, and he would come in his *famous* basketball chaddi <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>  He has never opened up to me, prolly that is because I have never spent enough time with him in 2nd year. <br><br>  A real good friend, and damn mature! Another lad who has been heating GH in his stay here <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br><br>Note to him: Apna gussa control mein rakha kar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In first year we din have any of those sessions where people get senti and speak their heart out. But our strings just clicked ... he offered me to be his roommate and there we were sharing one room.<br>From that time this guy has been one of my best buddies in IIIT ... he has supported me a lot in my II year ... being a roomy with this guy was an awesome experience. We never-ever fought over anything. He likes to keep the room clean ... and I'm one of never-clean-his-room kind of guy ... but he never complained. We have had a lot of hilarious BC sessions and walks around the campus .. and buddy m still not clear in which city you were in which standard <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>This guy is addicted to photography. I still remember the first time I bought a camera phone and we had a photosession ... about 150 photos were clicked in a room that day .. and that was AWESOME <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. And obviously he has improved in his photography skills. just one weird thing .. he ne'er looks AT the camera when hes gettin a photo clicked <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>We have had a weird badluck in many things when we're together ... its like ... every excursion we go on .. if something CAN go wrong it WILL go wrong. But anyways we've njoyed even those badlucks <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. We have somewhat similar taste for music and have njoyed a lot of time listening to one another's colection.<br>Also, this guy is a fatta master .. although he has lost his touch .. but still he comes back in form once in a while. He must be the guy with max nicknames in IIIT. Every t-shirt he gets has some or the other weird symbols which contributes to his nickname <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Ask him to shout and you'll hear that buzzing sound for the next three days. bhagvan ne ise gala nahi loud speaker diya hai. He doesn't need a phone to talk to his parents .. he just shouts and they listen to him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. He even thinks loud enough that you can hear him <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><br>This was whatever I can think as of now .. but m sure its not finished .. there will be more .. wait and watch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
