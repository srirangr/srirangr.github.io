<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Pankaj Saini -- A voracious reader of our batch. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> And due to his reading habits, he has achieved a good command over English. Whenever I have any doubt related to English, either I ping him or go to him to clarify my doubt.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And he undoubtedly clarifies them in most of the cases.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I am really thankful to him for that. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Initially, even I used to see English movies of his choice.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He is really a friendly and helping guy. <br>In addition to reading, he also writes nice posts on his blog. Sometimes, he writes about himself on his post but it is truly difficult to digest all that in one go.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Even we both participated in many events together viz DumbC, G.K. Quiz etc. All was really a great fun.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I will really miss that period.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Wish you achieve whatever aim in your life.<br>Stay in touch.<br>CHEERS!!<br><br>P.S. There must be some mistakes in this testimonial too. Do overlook them for a time being. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Some people apparently have boundless, illimitable energy - they are on the go from morning to night and often far into the night, working hard, never tiring, never worn out or exhausted - and getting twice as much done as any three other human beings. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>One such people in our batch is SAMBHAV JAIN <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> aka tinka(I still don't know why do people call him with this name).In addition to being excellent at studies<img src=Smileys/26.gif />, he took responsibilities of many events, may be cultural or related to academics. Kudos to him for managing all that!!<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>He is a good designer too and has worked for designing many t-shirts. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Wish him a great future ahead.<br>Stay in touch.<br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>KAPIL BAJAJ -- An exceptionally hard-working and devoted student from my home town,JAIPUR.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I don't know where I stand in front of such guys in terms of devotion towards work. A guy like him devoted his whole mind towards his goal and has achieved it.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is the one who is an inspirational source for guys like me.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> No one was counting on him that he would be among the first ones to get through placements.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> But he has proved others wrong.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> His hard-word bore fruits finally.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has completed his and his family's dream. Kudos to him for that. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>One feature where we stand at two different ends is that he never feels nostalgic <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> about his home whereas I feel nostalgic now and then.<img src=Smileys/10.gif />  <br>In addition to being good at studies, he is also good at sports. He is the captain of our batch basketball team. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Wish him a great future ahead.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Stay in touch.<br>CHEERS!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kabeer.html>Kabeer Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kabeer -- One of the most awesome footballers @ IIIT-H<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. His main strength is his SPEED<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is a very good athlete and has secured First position in 200 m relay on IIIT-H's Annual Sports Day. He is one of the most dedicated guys in our batch. If he takes up something, he devotes his whole concentration in it.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>He is really a great friend of mine.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He even motivates me to play outdoor games viz. football, basketball etc.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And it was him due to which I got interest in football. I have not started playing football yet but I am seeing it on television these days.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>He is really a great inspirational source for guys like me who don't play outdoor games much.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I would surely start playing some outdoor games in future.<br>I am greatly thankful to you for being such an inspiration to me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Wish you a great future ahead.<br>Stay in touch.<br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

And then dedicates his soul for it.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> In most of the cases, he has achieved whatever he has aimed.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>He has been my room partner for first two years of our college life. And due to that, I am aware of some of his bad qualities as well.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> A few are: -<br><ol><br><li>Banda subah bhi light jalakar padhta hai<img src=Smileys/26.gif /></li><br><li>Apna kamra kam hi clean rakhta hai<img src=Smileys/2.gif /></li><br><li>Pehle roj nahin nahata tha.. but shayad aaj kal roj nahata hai</li><br><li>Jitna khana plate mein lekar aata hai..utna to kabhi nahin khata..humesha jhootha chhodta hai<img src=Smileys/14.gif /></li><br></ol><br>Arey iska matlab yeh nahin ki isme achchaiyan nahin hain .. iski achhaiyan to anginat(infinite) hain .. aur utni main likh nahin sakta ..lekin kuch to main yahan likh hi deta hun ..<br><ol><br><li>Kabhi bhi kisi ko padhane se mana nahin karta<img src=Smileys/77.gif /></li><br><li>Kuch bhi activity karta hai.. to poore dedication se<img src=Smileys/41.gif />.. nahin to nahin karta</li><br><li>TT achcha khelta hai.. samne waala khud hi haar maan leta hai..iske returns se pareshan hokar<img src=Smileys/3.gif /></li><br><li>Banda apne Confidence ke balboote par apne opponent ki faade rakhta hai.. bt sometimes woh confidence thoda over ho jaata hai<img src=Smileys/21.gif /></li><br><li>Python par kaafi achchi command hai<img src=Smileys/4.gif /></li> <br></ol><br>There are many other qualities in him and that you have to find out after being his friend.<br>Aaj kal yeh kisi bandi ke peeche hai.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>I wish ki ise woh ladki mil jaaye..<br>Wish you a great future ahead!!<br>Be my friend forever.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One who is a mixture of Fun, Hard Work, Aggressiveness and many other qualities(be his friend to know about them) is none other than Richeek Arya.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is one of my very first friends at IIIT-H. We both used to hang out at canteen to discuss about our CGPA. But at the end, he is the one who went far ahead than me in terms of CGPA. I really admire him for his HARD WORK.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> And it was the result of his hard work that he got a decent score in GRE.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He is a fun loving guy and wishes to enjoy every second of his life.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We really enjoy our friendship. Even we had fights sometimes.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> And as everyone knows, he is aggressive and gets annoyed sometimes if anyone plays pranks at him.<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> One prank which I played at him only a few days ago is as follows: - <br><center><i>"One morning, I saw his room was opened and no one was there. I went inside and took his mobile phone and switched it off.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Then I hid it in between his dirty clothes.<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Then I, him and Aditya Singhal went for lunch. There I told Adi about his mobile without letting him know about it. After that, I went for sleep. When I woke up, I came to know that Richeek had gone to Reliance World to cut the outgoing calls.<img src=Smileys/13.gif /> I really never knew that it would go to such an extent and I never wished that.<img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>I returned his mobile to him. And then he asked me to accompany him to the Reliance World to re-start outgoing calls. Initially, I refused since I thought that I must not be blamed for it. I just played a prank and I never thought it to go like that. He got annoyed from me for that. Then I admitted my mistake and got ready to accompany him because I can't live at IIIT-H without talking to him"</i></center><br>He has really been a great friend to me. He even phones to his family late night whenever I ask him for any medication. I am really thankful to his DIDI as well for helping me out.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is among the one who motivated me to write posts.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>It's very difficult to get such a friend.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I wish our friendship remains forever.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Wish you a great future ahead!!<br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><center><b>A BOND in deeds is a BOND indeed</b></center><br>Harsh Vardhan Bansal perfectly justifies the above statement. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is really a marvelous guy.<img src=Smileys/4.gif />  Jis cheez ko bhi chhoo de, woh sona ho jaati hai..<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Jahan bhi apne kadam rakh de .. woh thodi si dab jaroor jaati hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. bt saath hi saath khushnuma bhi ho jaati hai..<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Whatever he maneuvered, he has achieved.<img src=Smileys/1.gif />(I don't know, what should I wish for him<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) He is one of the most brilliant students in our batch.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He has not only maintained an excellent CGPA through out the college life but also got calls from six IIMs. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>He does many other things in addition to studies viz. writing blogs, playing TT or computer games etc.<br>I know you are going to have a great future ahead. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I wish that you never ever forget me.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Wish you achieve whatever you aim in your life.<br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><center><b>A friend in need is a good friend indeed</b></center><br>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal alias Naughty is one of my friends who justifies the above statement. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Whenever I have asked him for help, he neither refused me nor made any excuses.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> We built a good friendship right in the first year of our college life.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> As he was a a very studious student before coming to the college (AIEEE AIR - 345 justifies that<img src=Smileys/77.gif />), he continued to be the same in the first year. He used to catch cold almost every year after coming to the college, and that even proved to be a slight hindrance in his studies. <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  In spite of that, he used to teach me a few subjects in the first year. I still remember "RAID" taught by him.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> Then we had a trip to Ooty, Munnar etc. in our second year which strengthened our friendship.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> We enjoyed a lot in that trip. We even won "Kahani mein Twist" during Felicity'07.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> In third year, we even organised "Kahani Mein Twist" during Sunday Carnival. Similarly, we did many things together such as .. Going to Nalsar's Annual Fest etc.<br>But I did not know why our friendship did not run as well in our fourth year <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> as in the previous three years. Possibly because that time, he was more conscious about his placements.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> Now in a last few days of our college, we are together again.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> In these days, either we watch out movies @ night in my room or we listen to some melodies.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>That was just a short description of our friendship.<br>In addition to being a great student, he is a good artist. You could see most of his paintings on his blog. And he even boosted my confidence for writing posts. I love a few Gharwali songs which he made me to hear.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One I love most is -- "Satura Ki Dhauni"<br>At the end, I just want to say ..<br>Our friendship is not limited to four years.. it is a bond between both of us for an unlimited period of time. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>I wish you achieve whatever you aim in your life. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Subroto - One of the most <b>Frustoo</b> guy in our batch.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He has crush on almost every girl in IIIT-H.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> And he also keep their pics in his PC. I don't know how he gathers so many pics of them. Not only he keeps their pics but also try to compare them with some Bollywood/Hollywood heroine.<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> According to him, one girl in our batch looks like Mallika Sherawat. I suppose she also knows about that. <br>Inspite of all that, he is a very good guy at heart.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> His friends can always find him ready for help. He is a cheerful guy who wants his ambiance to be cheerful too.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a great student and also good at some sports(viz. Cricket) and computer games(viz. Pocket Tanks). In ECE batch, he is among the top 5 students.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I still don't know how he maintains his position among such brilliant batch mates. And that's why he has been an inspirational source for me.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>In spite of being a good athlete, he is very slow at walking.<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> I can bet that his grandmother(if alive) could also walk faster than him.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>We both are very good friends right from the very first year of our college life. That time, he used to teach me a few courses as we had same courses in the first year. In that year, he used to tease me with some cheap word and due to that, I took him to Prof. Mitra where Prof. Mitra told him not to repeat that word again.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> He became upset from me due to that <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but, as I told you, he is very good at heart, he forgave me. And our habit of eating Maggi late night strengthened our friendship. We both participated together in Kahani Mein Twist. But only once, we were able to secure First position in it.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Now, I can't pass a single day without meeting him.<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I everyday visit his room. I don't know how am I going to pass the very next year without him .<br>I will miss you a lot,buddy.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Hope you achieve whatever you desire in your life. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>CHEERS!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Part - I</u><br>Jis prakar "Piyush" ki ek boond, insaan ko "Amar" kar deti hai .. Usi prakar mere priya dost "Piyush" ke saath ki gayi dosti, insaan ko "Khushi" se tar batar kar deti hai..<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He is a very great guy to befriend with.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a very cordial person who never ever cheats with his friends. And the quality which makes him the <b>UNIQUE</b> as a friend is: -<br><center><b>He is an extremely kind person who easily forgives misbehavior conducted by his friends.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b><br>To justify the above sentence, I wish to give one example: -<br><i>I and Piyush took "Gandhi and India" course in our 7th Sem. In that course, we had to choose a topic for the presentation. Piyush mailed his choice before me. But as was mentioned in the mail sent by Pranav(who was teaching us G&I) we had to go to Pranav to specify our choice and it was me who went to him first. And I told him the same choice which was already mailed by Piyush to him. Since Piyush was not able to come to him due to some unavoidable reasons, Pranav asked me to persuade Piyush to change his choice. I went back to my room and started forcing Piyush to change his choice through Gtalk. During that chat, I used some bad words as well<img src=Smileys/10.gif />(it was all joke), but I did not know that Piyush would take it seriously<img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Then for me, he changed his choice but was not happy with my demeanor.<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> That night, I went to him and I asked him to pardon me for my naughtiness which I did during the chat<img src=Smileys/26.gif />. And he was so kind to me that he forgave me for such a nuisance behavior(it was all joke from my end but not from Piyush's) which I imparted during the chat.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Kudos to such a lovely friend <img src=Smileys/77.gif /></i></center><br>In addition to all this, he is a great student  and a great designer. He devotes his whole concentration while designing or painting. He is a great dedicated guy and has learned a lot in TT just due to his dedication.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Part -II</u><br>I always try to make Piyush smile on my silly jokes because "Jis prakar suraj ki roshni andhera door kar deti hai.. usi prakar piyush ke chehre ki smile dusron ko khush kar deti hai"<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Have a great future ahead,buddy..<br>I wish you achieve whatever you aim in your life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>CHEERS!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

According to him, he was a "CHHUPA RUSTAM" (i.e. who has a lot of knowledge <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> but does not let others know about it).<br>He built a very good flash website for Felicity'08 <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> but it is really disappointing that it was not finally chosen. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>If someone would ask him for help, he would surely provide it irrespective of whether he is his friend or not. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He is really a great guy to befriend with.<br>I enjoyed "Systems and Network Security" course with him. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Wish you achieve, what you aim in your life. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is a very dedicated and nice hearted person. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is a very good and caring friend of mine. I can rely on him in my bad times. He has helped me a lot in last four years. <br><br>Jab main CVIT mein tha, tab ye hi mere ko padata tha ..... manta hun ki mere grades kabhi un courses mein achche nahin aaye .... but isne poori koshish ki mere ko padhane ki .. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>If you have a problem, others would make a fun of you except a few who would try to help you and this guy is among those exceptions.<br><br>Actually, meri mom ne mere ko train mein akele j/aane se mana kiya hai. And most of the times, yeh banda apni research se time nikal kar mere saath chalne ko ready ho jaata hai kyunki yeh meri problem samajhta hai. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And the quality for which I admire him the most is his UNSELFISHNESS. He does not help others to get something in return. <br><br>I wish to write a lot about him ..... but that lot will also be very little.<br>I just now wish to dedicate a few lines to our friendship ..<br><br>Tujhe bina mile mera..<br>Nahin ye din gujarta hai ..<br>Koi aur na samjhe ..<br>yeh mera dil samajhta hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>us dosti mein bhi kya maja ..<br>jahan nokjhok ka zarra naa ho <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>na paida hone denge wo haalat ..<br>jisme humein apni dosti ko khona ho <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>yeh jivan to pal bhar ka..<br>ek pyara nazara hai <br>par is jivan se bhi badh kar<br>apna janmon ka yaara hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All THE VERY BEST for your future, mere dost <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I wish ki humari dosti humesha kayam rahe <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>CHEERS.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

And his view point about that thing does not depend on others.<br>He is a great guy to befriend with. <br>ALL THE VERY BEST FOR FUTURE,buddy!!<br><b><br>Msg for you: Apni shaadi mein mere ko jaroor bulana <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;<br>K -- Katli<br>A -- Awesome<br>B -- Beauty<br>B -- Beauty (once more <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>U -- Ultimate<br>All the above words specify the quality of questions he asks. If you club all the initial letters, you will get a word, "KABBU", a name given to him by me. One thing I like about him the most is his "PASSION". <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> If he has decided to achieve something, he will dedicate his soul and mind for it. And if anywhere, by any means, his purpose is getting fulfilled, he does not mind what others will think about him. And apart from this, the weirdest quality I find in him is his great liking for "HORROR" movies. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>If I have to describe him in one word, then I would say ..... "I can't describe him in one word, yaar!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but one thing I can say about him is that he is very good at heart and that might be the probable reason, why he has more girlfriends as compared to others in our batch" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><b> <br>Character he resembles: Sunil Shetty in 1 2 3 <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav. Memory: When we used to live in the same wing in NBH. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Msg for him: Daddu se Duniyadari seekh, KABBU!! <img src=Smileys/26.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Jab bhi main Ranga ko dekhun, mera dil deewana bole ..<br><br>Taarif karun kya uski, jisne tumhe banaya .. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Ranga is a very energetic person <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> and I know this from my very first meeting with him in the football ground. The best thing about him is that whenever you be with him, you also feel the same energy. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The GOD has bestowed him with many qualities - a melodious voice, a beautiful smile (even you can see that in his profile pic), a great heart, perfection in speaking multiple languages, etc, etc.  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> It's very difficult for me to even dream of last four years without him. He is the one among the few who has amicable relations with everyone in our batch. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I must say, he is the one who represents our batch. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> All the four pics pasted above which have RANGA in common, justify the same. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>I can't ever forget the trip to Ooty which strengthened our friendship. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I have many beautiful memories along with him. I can't write them all.<br>I wish you a VERY GOOD LUCK for your future endeavours. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and at the end ..<br>HUM HAIN RAHI PYAAR KE ..... phir milenge CHALTE CHALTE <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>His aptitude's range is truly formidable. He is one of the best all-rounder we have in our batch.  <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>The range of his abilities cut across all fields. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  He is a great student, <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> great blogger, great manager(he'll prove it to the world after getting MBA degree), <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> great sportsman and to top it all he is a great friend.  There is more to it but since I don't have such a great vocabulary to write all his great qualities, I can't write more. <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  But if I have to sum up all his qualities in one sentence I would say ..<br><br>He is not 'Jack of all trades' <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br><br><br><br>He is "The Master of all Trades" <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Character he resembles: Yohaan Awasthi in TZP <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Message for him: Don't forget me in future <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Peace. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>HE is cultivated, poised, tactful, socially so experienced, sophisticated, and courteous that he feels at home in any group, at ease under all circumstances of social intercourse. You cannot  help admiring his smoothness and self-assurance, his tact and congeniality. If in one word I have to sum up all his qualities, I would say<br>"Our Daddu is URBANE" <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I learned a lot from him during my college life.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He is like an elder brother to me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And today, if I have to take any decision (political <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), I take the decision keeping DADDU in mind. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>Jab Daddu kisi ki khichai karta hai to woh bhi jamkar karta hai. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>Initially, jab Daddu mujhe kuch samjhana chahta to mere ko lagta tha ki woh meri le raha hai aur main us par gussa ho jaata tha. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br>Dheere dheere mere ko lagne laga .... Daddu kisi ki leta jaroor hai .. but woh kisi ka nuksaan nahin chahta, bhala hi chahta hai. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I feel proud to have Daddu as my batchmate. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>In case, I go to America, U.K. or Japan in future, I would miss Daddu at least.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Daddu tu itna aage jaayega ki ..... pichhe se duniya kahegi .. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br><br><br><br>"Jitna chaho aage jaao par humse door na jaao" <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If an Indian goes abroad, and a foreigner asks him about India, he would say "Where Taj Mahal is...". Similarly, in near future, when someone would ask about IIIT-H, a reply from any Indian student would be "Where 'GEEKAY' did his graduation...yaar!!". <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>He is a disciplined, dedicated, hard-working, perseverant, and a smart guy. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is younger than me but far more knowledgeable. <img src=Smileys/26.gif />  Any one can learn a lot from this guy. I hope you would get better and better with time. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Wish you a Good Luck for your future. <br>And at the end, ..<br><br><br><br>I just wish for myself that I would complete my MS before your future plans get fulfilled. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
