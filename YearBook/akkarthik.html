<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Well .. All I know is that AK stands for " Ati Kasi " and he;s a very nice person to talk to. Gymboy. And very very very punctual/disciplined guy.  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I liked to tease you "AK loves you" on Felicity 09 3rd day. It was a nice memory. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future macha. Keep rocking.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>      I know, i know, you did not expect a testimonial from me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Well, Suprise suprise! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>       One tricky question you can ask AK is ask him to choose which of the two are his favorites - WWE or ECE .. He will have a real tough time choosing one of the two. I say, ECE ka kya hai, choose WWE dude <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>      We both were in the same college (or jail) in our 12th. He was this <i><b> phodu </b></i> in Physics, something at which I totally sucked. Still, I never gave him a chance to come first in class <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>           I started talking to him only through his friends Prateek and Sharat and they totally totally love him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He watches a lot of TV series, WWE, football and what not! Not a big fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> grrr.. <br><br>     I think everybody must have changed from the way they were initially during their stay in IIIT, but Karthik I guess is an exception. It would be really nice if you break this record of being the same as you were <i>bachpan mein</i> - just a solicitous advice <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>     I thought you would finish off your MS even before we finish our B.Tech <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , but anyways all the very best for your future. We will stay in touch and yeah, I started watching WWE and it rocks m/ </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gnpkumar.html>Nagarjuna Pavan Kumar G</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>though he is from ECE(D), we never had that great discussions till 2nd and 3rd years...But after coming to 4th year and also due to NBH mess, I came to see the other side of AK..he's a talented guy and of course a damn good hard worker....<br>so he became the ultimate....He loves WWE...always asked me to watch it for some discussion...but i never did it...<br>he became a rebel in his final semester because of 'n' number of people...first of all because of his guide and then because of some other faculty members...and the transformation in him is a great entertainment to all of us though.... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>"Felicity 2009" is honoured by his presence.<br>Anyway,I hope he achieves what he wants to and enjoys his life to the max possible extent from now...<br>Nagarjuna</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nagallas.html>Satish Chandra Prasad</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>mama pedda patith , ramudu manchi baludu type pujalu chestaadu , studies lo picha keka n a nice frnd<br><br>all da best fr ur future mama !!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=john.html>Samuel John</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>sometimes when we meet in mess --wrestling topics discussion , inka manodu gym boy , decent , cool and calm ... anni gud qualities , alaa yela vuntaaru mama <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>------</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=arsreddy.html>Raja sekhar reddy A</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>only hard working , sincere ,cool guy of our batch</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=yvsandeep.html>Sandeep Y V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>a very decent guy(the most) in iiit. He taught me how to play age and we both watched a lot of animes(dbz) in lab... a core gamer at heart and a genius in mind... he rocks all subjects.. still donno how he got 90+ in social choice theory midsem.. all the best dude....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[contd]<br><br>He has always been helpful throughout my B.Tech. Kind at heart and never really took personal credit when it came to team projects (even if he was the only one who had worked on the project). He helped a lot during Felicity days, when I was bundled with loads of work. A great team player and is always on huge demand whenever some project pops out. He goes to the gym every day, but sadly wasn't able to defeat me when it came to arm wrestling. He is the co founder of IIIT Hyderabad Fight Club (coming soon, location - new building).<br><br>Memorable moment: Felicity 09 Rock Show, EW Final Project<br><br>Triva: Till the time I was his roommate his CGPA was 8.something and after that it went to 9.something <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>N Ananth Krishna Karthik (formerly known as NA Karthik a.k.a Sodium) is a geek kid of IIIT - H. I had met him first when I was in class 10 (Sharma Coaching). We used to sit in the last bench and were the best sollu buddies. He was the first person to get a slap (which will go down into the history books of IIT foundation classes) from Srinu Sir - a psycho lecturer who was known for his awesome jokes. He isnt that sincere people. He used to bunk classes when he was in Mega Study Circle. He used to throw his bag from 3rd Floor to the 1st Floor and then run away from the 1st Floor. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Then I met him during AIEEE counseling session. He was still the same - a geek kid. Fortunately/Unfortunately both of us joined electronics department at IIIT Hyderabad. First year half my C/C++ code used to come from him and the rest half was original <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> After observing his dedication towards his work he was given the title of 'A kasi karthik'.  He follows football and is a core Chelsea fan, but he does not play well when it comes to the field play. (BTW Chelsea Sucks! Join Arsenal). His favourite hobby during the first eyar days was to install Windows XP in his Dabba PC.<br><br>Second year was fun watching FRIENDS. He plays AOE and FIFA exceptionally good. Aggressive tactics and a strategic player are the key words that describe his game play. I must have defeated him once or twice not more than that. Slowly from A Kasi Karthik he transformed into Baba A K. I remember I had tough times during exams when people used to come for darshan every morning just before writing exams. <br><br>[contd]</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=marepallybhanu.html>M.Bhanu Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This is the person who does 3 times pooja everyday<=>ramam in aparichithudu.I think, the only guy in iiit who who writes evrything he reads for his exams (entire notes,assignments...).<br>Has some typical dialogues of his own---<br>No Comments --> after exam<br>Grades doesn't matter --> results r out<br>shameless ,+ a*****e --> angry or to counter<br>some assets --<br>Only guy who can scold prof. in front of him without fear.<br>Can do his ms in an year or few months if he wishes.<br>Come what may follows his daily rountine.<br>whether its felicity or anyother event if its saturday or sunday home is the place he will be at.<br><br><br>the gym (chest)boy (his dream to come to nbh mess without shirt) who tries to wake me up whenever he goes to gym.My mess buddy (fixed time) frm nbh.<br><br>Inka enti all the best ra nee MS ki first ithe evarikindo confirm chesuko <br>meethadi neeku etu li8<br>Lets do something crazy ...ak</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>AK Karthik - the most sincere guy .... by mistake in first year i went to his room ... akkada room matram too much ante too much neat .... inka whenever i passby his room, all i would notice is that he is studying ... n ya ... be it any weekend ... this guy rushes to HOME ... i seriously wondered whats @ home ... be it any chance to get a 2 day holiday n he wouldnt be in IIIT ... secret enti inti daggara or inti pakkana ?? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>this guy has got typical tamil accent .. n very good at heart ... d most studious guy ... too concentrated that doesnt even notice any1 around while walkin ... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..<br>b d way u r dude always .. n keep rockin ... </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=muppanasarat.html>Arun M.S.C</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>the only sincere guy of our batch</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>arey, '09 hai re, josh mein sare 8s aa rahe toh, '08 samaj liya. fuck! never mind.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>8:00 PM, 8th April '08<br><br>a[1], a[2], a[3]....'a[k]'<br><br>Spotted! AK, clean-shaved (OMG!! OMG!! OMG!!) and ready to take on some ghee-spread chappatis in NBH messu. For a moment, I was like "Dude, did some Tamil movie hero just pass by?" It was a "waw" moment, trust me.<br><br>Frankly speaking, whenever I meet AK (with his 'bhotu' on his forehead and a delightful smile) in the mornings during breakfast, it kinda brings in some tranquility into my chaotic mind. I see discipline, 'focus' and such good things in him, which are like...positively martian to me. That's why I like spending some time with him. We also attended the same "St. Patricks" for our +2 studies, where we used discuss about ZEE fuckin' MGM's late night movies sitting in the last bench. It was ulti-fun baap! and I know you're gonna rape your MS thesis and all, so I won't bother.<br><br>You raack mama<br>sharat</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Firstly ak congratulations on continuing your loosing streak in predicting wrestle mania results. The streak continues <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .  Yeah so coming to other details of ak<br><br>This guy was not a part of three felicities and suddenly decided that i have to show my presence in this one. He was present on all the three days, did headbanging on rock, tied head bands and put on monkey face costumes with us and did hooting also <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> . I never knew you could do so much racha ak. You are atikasi in everything.<br><br>One thing to be seen is watccchaaa gonna do when batchamania goes wild in this last month. Don't come over my side and say "you can't see me coz i was at home playing PS2 again" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br><br>Character you resemble: <b>Randy orton</b> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( Not even remotely)<br><br>Now dont get over emotional about this but yes do give me the treat you promised asap. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=shashankl.html>shashank lagishetty</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>AK -  adi kreestu shakam 3230 samvasatsaram(3230BC),  goddess saraswati is taking a online tutorial to lord vinayak. But some other ordinary god captured those packets and got so much knowledge. Then the system administrator got angry and banned him. so he sent him to earth. He took his birth as 200531002. But unlike his previous birth, he is very sincere, reliable etc etc... in this janma.<br><br>I don't like you because you treat EC and CS differently. never gave treat to us. I like u because you are good at brain and heart too. <br><br>where do u buy shirts man?? You needn't worry about ur job dude. u can join as a wwe strategist. neeku manchi future vundi ra nijanga. if u join there please arrange a meet with HBK.<br><br>Green kamars vachina vadiki lokam antha green ga kanipinchinattu veediki lokam antha kasi ga kanipistadi. grades doesn't matter to him similar to centuries doesn't matter to sachin.<br><br>You are very humble, friendly and have many other gud qualities dude. <br><br>Learn to play outdoor games, see some movies in theatre.<br><br>1st acquaintance - saw while you are pouring water from the window. i didn't understand what you are doing and scolded slowly for throwing water outside.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Q : Ak .. how do u achv dis CG of abv 9 dude?<br>Ak's ans : No comments.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Hav u heard da words a** ***e or f u in NBH mess.. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> dat means AK's around .. hmm .. dis guy to me is [or was ] disciplined , motivated nd at da same time manages to go home evry week .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> i tried to beat him but succeeded only in da latter part .. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br>  Antonym of Ram Reddy's room == Ak's room.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Aspires to be a schwarzenegger nd is half way ovr der .. <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> my BC partner in mess nd vil b so 4 two more years .. wat say AK? <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>PS : Dual degree ..naah..

<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Athi Kasi Karthik aka AK is a very calm and serious looking guy, but he is a very fun loving and lovely person. He is damn serious about his acads. He also plays some games not to mention DOTA. when ever we meet at least for some time we discuss about it. One of the most hardworking student. Never stays in campus if a holiday comes, he rushes to his home being a local guy. All the best for ur MS ra AK .. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hmm... instead of writing testimonials like this about our beloved Anantha Krishna Karthik a.k.a AK, one can really write a book or a research paper (if he/she could!). A.K., though stands for Anantha Krishna, can also be read "Athi Kasi". And rightly so. He's one of the punctual persons I've ever seen in my life. A very good friend of mine; whom I can trust every time. Though he looks very serious, he's very funny, kind-hearted and one helluva kind person.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hmm AK lets describe him<br><i> Whenevr you see a guy chanting hymns at 9 pm(IIITST)5 3o am(IST)</i> <b> u know its AK</b><br><i> Whenever you see a guy doing nothing but benchpress in the gym</i> u know its AK</b><br><i> Whenever you see the guy who catches 216 at 3:10 pm on Saturdays</i> <b>there will be many but the one from IIIT will be AK <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> </b><br><br>PS Sledgehammer awaits Orton on April 5th <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>PS2 Testi to be continued....... after WrestleMania ha ha ha </b></i></ul><br><br>
