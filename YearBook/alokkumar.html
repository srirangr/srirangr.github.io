<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Alok aka bihari !!!<br><br>He is a damn sincere guy, always works his ass off and does everything dedicately.

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bihari Babu:<br><br>Alok is the probably the most affectionate person I have ever seen in my life. He absolutely adores his pals. Not only is he very helpful, but he never, ever minds anything they say or do. In fact, that behavior of his remains for almost anyone to some extent or the other. I absolutely adore him.<br><br>Bande ki kuchh limitations thi, jinke chalte ye apne mast maula nature se nahi jee saka. Ab vo toh hamesha hi rahengi dost. Jo mila, bahut mila. Humne group mein bahut BC ki hai, par individually nahi. Lekin maine kabhi is baat ko mind nahi kiya, aur zindagi mein kabhi bhi individually mere saath time spend karne ka chance mila, to jhijhakna mat. Ye kahaani yaheen se start hogi. Bahut saare achchhe log milte hain. Sabse utni dosti nahi ho paati, but if there is something they can do for you, they will do it. And given an opportunity, you will be friends with them. Aisa hi sochna mere baare mein, because that's what I think about you.<br><br>Chalo bhai. Dil se dua hai ki tumhe jald se jald tumhaari pasand ki ladki mil jaaye. <br><br><b>Memories:</b> Your sweet and gritty nature.<br><b>10 years down the line I see you as:</b> Married for > 7 years, leading a good, peaceful life.<br><b><Will miss you for:/b> The BC sessions, the Bhojpuri tone, the absolute welcoming nature and warmth of your great group. <br><b>Tags:</b> Sweet, studious, group BC</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part3</b><br>Now coming to Alok 2.0 i.e. new Alok in the final semester... Never caring about anything....

<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part2 </b><br>When I first met him in cellar and when he told me he was from Bihar, I never thought we would become so close friends one day... Alok proved all my misconceptions about Bihari wrong <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... Also scar on his face gives him looks of typical Bihari Bhaiyya <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>But as time progressed I found him very friendly... Meri sabse jyada discussions hoti thi is bande se... Koi bhi topic pe hum discuss karte the.... Personal life, social or political issues and even many philosophical points too <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>When I used to be worried about my Google result, Alok used to give me confidence.... Your support was always great buddy and I appreciate that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Ye banda waise kabhi kabhi bahot frustoo ho jaata tha...Ladkiyon ke liyo bahot jyada desperate ho jaata tha... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Bahot baar decide karta hai ki gaaliyan nahi dunga...lekin kabhi nahi chhod paaya...Kya kare bhai log sudharne hi nahi dete... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Iske bhaiya ki shaadi me bahot maje kiye hai isne... After coming here when he started getting some flirty SMS and calls, his joy knew no bounds... Banda itna khoosh hoke aaya tha mere paas... Par baad me kat gaya pata chal ki wo bhabhiji thi... <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>Banda itni saari baatein share karta hai...ki mujhe bhi koi bhi baat batane me aitaraaz nahi lagta...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part1:</b><br>Alok or I love to call him <i>Alukwa</i> is one of the most helpful and friendly guys in our class.<br><br>He is my one of best friends in IIIT. He shares all things with me and I too share things with him. Whenever I get bored, the first thing I do is to go to his room.... Phir kaphi baatein hoti ho aur saara boredom door ho jata hai... Whenever I am in trouble ,I go to him and he is always there to solve my problem. Let the problem be anything from exam or assignment, attendence or any other things, Alok is ready to help you. <br><br>He is one of the most tolerant guys I have ever seen in my life. We have teased him for almost three years and still continue it, but he never got angry even after we ruined his chances of potential gf <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>He is always ready to entertain the group even at the cost of his own fun. Making fun while teasing others is easy but making fun of yourself to make others laugh is worthy of praise <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He always sings the song of the year (recently it has became song of the month) whenever he gets chance to sing even if people continue to criticise him for that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. <br><br>He is very sincere and hard-working guy <img src=Smileys/77.gif />... He studies each subject with full dedication... He has been teaching us many subjects in the last four years... and also gives us the assignments to copy <img src=Smileys/3.gif />... Thanks for all that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He says he is a public property <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> as his room is.... He is generally not alone in his room.... He will never say NO to a friend for anything... <br><br>Waise ye bahot badaa BC baaz hai.... bas isko kahi pe baithne ko mil jaaye aur bc karne waale log mil jaaaye..... baaki kisi cheez ki jaroorat nahi padegi<br><br>Alok is an integral part of our group... Uske bina group adhura sa lagta hai <img src=Smileys/2.gif />...I can't imagine our group without him... I will really miss you Alok <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>People call him Ganja and so he used to ask me for hair oil many times, all because of those people who call him Ganja.<br>As every other Bihari I've met, Alok is hard working and extremely helpful. (others were also soft spoken, can't say that about him. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )<br>Anyways, Alok has this inner compulsion of helping others, being the good guy.<br>I, and many others, have surely benefitted a lot from it! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Recently when my laptop's hard disk crashed, he allowed me to take his laptop while he rested or was not using (of course he was the first person I asked for it! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ).<br>We met properly in 6th semester when we took DDBMS course together. He helped me a lot with the coding part of the project, but only after 2 days of watching three seasons of the Beauty and the Geek.<br>Well, he also like to do a lot of BC (Baat Cheet) online or onsite. Initially when he joined Vatasal and me for jogging last semester, I thought that he doesn't exercise much so once in a while I used to speed up a bit to get ahead, but he always caught up with me and had enough stamina to overtake me!<br>Sometimes we've had long conversations about life in general and it was fun. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Lately something has got into him and he's not sparing any possible of not cracking a PJ <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> but alas his PJs lack the quality my PJs had. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his helping attitude...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2:<br>On personal level he is a great learner. Once he realises a quality lacking in him, he wld try very hard to enculcate that. He deserves appreciation for his efforts to learn English...he read many novels and regularly referred dictionary..today he hs a better vocabulary than me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...spent a lot of time in learning Java and improve his coding...used to prepare 4 CAT...he actually is doing smthing or d othr at all times to get better...I appreciate dis quality of urs... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He has a passion for Hindi stories and poems. U can often find him reading premchand's books or some other hindi novels. He wld then share wid us d phrases he liked in tht.<br><br>Whenever Ganja used to teach smthing or explain smthing he always used analogies of pati, patni to make us understand. It's his unique way and it was great fun for us.<br><br>Changed a lot in d last sem...he seemed to think a lot b4 talking to d fairer gender <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...aur ab to ekdum cool ho gaya hai...flirt bhi karne laga hai...and he is damn happy abt it <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>always available for u...if u r looking 4 a person for help..d 1st name tht comes 2 mind is Alok..<br><br>Used to Study continuously for many days at d time of exams. Massive determination & patience. He was Pankaj's roomie and we used to do BC all times in his room but he never paid attention to us and carried on his academic work. Just tht initially he lacked confidence and had d misconception tht others can do a thing better thn him. He gave his all but lacked belief in himself <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. It was d DDBMS course tht changed it all around. He worked very hard, all on his own and topped d course with unparalleled show <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . He never looked back after tht and now he's full of confidence. He's very happy he got a better SGPA than Ankush and me in d 7th<br>sem <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Congrats to you 4 tht. He has overtaken me for sincerity in classes as he even goes to Indic classes on time <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> (waise it won't hv been possible w/o my contribution as u r d same, main hi bigad gaya hoon <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> ).

<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>First of all wish u a very Happy Birthday...may God bless you wid all d happiness<br>and peace.<br><br>Ab testi shuru: I remember d 1st time I entered into Pankaj?s room and dis guy was<br>sitting in a corner of d room, reading a book. <br>Though he was silent, his looks and d marks on his face gave him d typical Bihari<br>look <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> I was afraid of him. But in just a few days time d whole<br> impression was forced to change by his supporting, caring and his kind nature, a<br>perfect gentleman <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He was d only person who was on my side in r BC<br> sessions, just to support me and hold me again d waves <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . This realization came<br>to me later, how stupid I was.<br><br>He is d most co-operative, most patient, most kind and helpful, most selfless, most<br>determined and sincere person of our batch. Very soft spoken, very<br>understanding...bas bhai doston ka dost hai ye banda.<br><br>Everyone who comes to his room feels as if its his own. You feel so comfortable<br>there <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Jab bhi kissi ka time pass na ho raha ho, he would cum to alok?s room <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>And Ganja would never complain, rather always entertain d person <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> pata nahi how<br>does he manage dis. Har time thr is smone in his room doing BC. Phir bhi alok does<br>his work on time...I mean Ganja would never say I?m busy or doing smthing...he?s<br>always available for u 24 X 7... Has helped each person of d batch...he has been d<br>saviour of many in many subjects...Hats off to u Ganja bhai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Baalon se bahut pyar hai ise <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Today on his b?day today he didn?t allow neone to<br>do silly things wid his hair...cake bhi nahi lagane diya sir pe <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ...nd even d<br>liquids (ketchup and shakes) tht were meant for his hair ...were applied to Sachin,<br>Paro and Bajaj <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ki Ganja khush rahe.<br><br>He is cool as a cucumber. He was teased a lot abt N in r group which he never used<br>to mind. But thn limits started crossing and all dis was made public. He kept his<br>own in d worst situations. I mean neone else wld hv reacted strongly, but he handled<br>d situation well. He is very mature in handling human relations <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>(contd)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>ALok Kumar is among my best friends  in IIIT, Someone who has stood by me all these years. Thank you for that. First look, he looks like a typical bihari gunda but he is the exact opposite once u get to know him. Let me tell u something about Alok. This guy is not very good in studies, he is literally afraid to talk to girls, above average  in  BC, has a avg job. Exceptionally hardworking but has been low on self confidence ( though has improved a lot on recent times ), below avg gamer. Tried gyming with avg success again. What I mean to say he is the avg Joe in all things I know except a very few things. Which are being good at heart, being dependable, being trustworthy, to sum up in being a friend ( just look at all the testimonials below)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Alok aka Ganja<br><br>Initially I knew this guy as Pankaj's roomie. Very decent guy I must say. Iski hum dono milkar khoob lete the but banda kabhi kuch nahi bolta tha. Hamesha ek pyari si smile deta rehta tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Kabhi bhi ise gussa hote hue nahi dekha. Kabhi ise rude hote hue bhi nahi dekha. A very mathured guy he is who knows how to behave in public. Aur masti ke time masti bnhi full karta hai. Bahut bada bcbaaz to hai hi. Ye, Atul aur Bajaj milkar jo banda down to earth hai, sincere hai, ye hai vo hai karke sabki udaate rehte hain but I'm telling you quite seriously dude that you definitely have all those qualities <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Yaad hai that Kabza song which we(Pankaj and me) used to listen a lot and you also liked that and you used to sing that in your typical Bihari tone aur fir hum jo teri maarte the, can't forget those memories in my whole life man <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. His sincerity towards studies is quite well known. He is also one of the THA contenders. This guy also tries to learn Haryanvi, Punjabi and Rajasthani tone and tries to speak to people of those states in their tones only which is a very nice and admiring gesture. Keep rocking dude. Don't change yourself. Achieve big in your life. May God bestow showers of success and happiness upon you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Alok aka Ganja is oen of those few guys whose company I'll always cherish. I must say, he is one of the most cultured and matured guys around. We both stayed in cellar and its there I came to know more about him. He is quite sophisticated too. Always ready to help and a down to earth guy. I remember once, he praised me so much in his room <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I don't know if he was serious or not but mate I liked it very much <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. One could see his dedication during the placements when he was the only person in the batch other than the pc members, who volunteered there day in and day out.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Alok, as Sachin would say, is one of the most admirable guys in the batch. You can <i>never</i> see Alok agitated over anything. Be it the amount of leofying he is subject to or the help he has to render his friends, he always takes it all with a smile. It is amazing how he can manage the smile even in the worst of situations. <br><br>He is the embodiment of sincerity and hard work, I was a witness to it being his neighbour in cellar. 4th year, final semester, and he is still all ears in the Indic class. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . I remember that he'd never refuse to teach any subject when we asked him to do so. Or for that matter, never refuse help to anyone in need. He is a very soft person at heart, and can never think of hurting anyone; which is so unlike the image we have for Biharis <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Bhai, aakhir Laloo ke desh mein bhi hire paida hote hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>It is fun listening to his fattes and leofying him. He, like three other guys has been regularly linked to Miss. X, Alok admitting his liking for her <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . Well, I remember one of those SE classes when he was continuously being leofied. <br><br>All in all, a wonderfully respectable person. Wish you all the very best in life!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Leofying you <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first interacted with him in 4th year while in OBH<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Had to go to his room for studying. I must admit here that his room is one of the most dirty and the most stinky rooms i've even gone to<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Sometimes i cant even take a single step inside his room, have to talk to him from outside<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I hope he'll realise the importance of a clean room someday. <br>         I used to take him with me for jogging and gym, and it really helped both of us a lot<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Overall he is a nice guy who 'tries' to look cool. He's Hard-working and very helpful. I owe him my placement prep. since he helped me a lot while placements and bringing me back to normal mode from an ultra-panic mode<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>         I'm sure you gonna do well in your life and I wish you Best Of Luck for Everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Unfortunately although we were on the same floor for almost 2 years, we didnt interact that much, but I will always remember his room on the other side in cellar, C-8 with him an Pankaj saini as the roomies.

Khud he confujia jata hai is maamle mein <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But the qualities he has ... has made me his fan <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. If I start listing out his qualities then this page will be filled by only that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>His kind and generous nature has always inspired me and I have learnt alot from him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Everyone tries to make comment on Alok and he always takes that in a positive way so most of the time he is the bait <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I remember one quotation "Its easy to laugh at someone but its very difficult make someone laugh at you" ... and he is the only person I have seen in my life who has made that difficult work look very easy <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Initially I felt a bit irritated when people use to do the same thing with me but Thanks to Alok that I am now walking on his path and it feels really great when you make other people laugh <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>If you want a trustworthy friend then he definitely falls in that category. If you want some help or asks him to do something for you then he will surely lend you his helping hand and will always be there till the work is completed. He is also very dedicated to studies always putting his 100% effort in each and every subject <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. You can better understand abt his dedication from the fact that while the college was celebrating Felicity '07 .. he was there in his room studying algorithms <img src=Smileys/13.gif />.<br><br>He takes to much tension when it comes to studies .. but he is enjoying the last semester in the best way. He accompanied us on Bastar trip and he is a very good entertainer .. he can sing (but lyrics ki Maa bhehan kar deta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) .. do BC and will let you feel bored. <br><br>The most memorable moments were when we use to have lunch and dinner in Yuktahar and had a lot of fun with him. He is very compromising by nature ... compromises each and every thing for other ... now he is compromising his Love for Guptha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is one of the few person whom I really respect <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.

<b><a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>18th July, 2005 .. I was allotted room C-9 in NBH.. and when I entered the room.. there was this guy.. sitting with his father.. when he told me he's from bihar (it was banaras actually <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) .. I told myself 'okay.. he's from Bihar.. so what' <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <br><br>But I don't know why.. I happened to open myself to him so freely.. he was the quiet types and I was quite the opposite.. I used to tell me all about how my life had been.. in school .. at home.. and he just used to listen.. I am pretty sure.. he fell asleep many a times.. during such tale-tells <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. <br><br>As with many of the people.. he was around me most of the times.. so we became very good friends... in no time... He'd always been dedicated to studies.. I know I used to study almost as much as him in the 1st sem.. but still I thot it better not to compete <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. <br><br>He was the one who trained me in all the slangs and bad words (not that I didn't know them but he helped a few of us to come out of that shelter <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) ... <br><br>During the most of first two years.. he was quite shy (not that he's not right now) but still a lot has improved.. <br><br>On one certain 'not so important' occasions.. he reveals that he liked a certain gal (not a very thoughtful thing to say <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) and this statement of his will come to haunt him for the rest of his stay at IIIT. <br><br>I used to be reckless with relations and money.. and He used to advice and guide me many a times. though it's a different thing that I never really considered his advices worthy.. I wish I had <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. <br><br>Anyways.. coming to the second half of our tenure.. he's been around for 'fun' this time. He's become sporty. He enjoys even when the fun is coming at his cost <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> which is something we all appreciate about him. As far as studies are concerned he still has the same sincerity .. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>I owe my placement to him. I wud bang at his door any time.. and there he wud be.. to hear out my queries and solve them.. I think he's one of the most helpful guys around.. never says 'NO' .. even to the most 'untolerable' people ... you k</b></i></ul><br><br>

I told him that I need to workout on these things.... he said lets do one thing ..we'll workout together on these .That was the day I came to know abt him ... and we became friends from classmates. We started studying, gyming , roaming , watching movies, BCing together. Most of the time I started spending in his room ... working out on Messenger (That we created <br>out of our interest). 1st yr me kabhi itni bat nahi hui ... bas iski "tere nam" wali hair style yad hai. Julfe latki hui forhead par <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.  Fir exams me sath padhne lage. n After that their was a drastic change in my CG. Thanks to alok <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Seriously he is very helpful,understading &  a patient guy. Sometimes I irritate him a lot, he warns me ...even then I continue irritating him... until he starts behaving in his own way ( for what<br>he is famous for). <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We have fought lots of time ...but both of us never took those fights seriously and 5 minutes later we start behaving in our normal way <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Tujhe frushtoo karne me bade aanand aate hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  Bandi ke lie bhi frushtoo ho chuka hai. Koi dila do yar ise.

Tab bhi smell nahi jati thi . Bhai gana gaane ka bhi shauk rakhte hain ... koi kuch bhi bole apni "male suraiyya" wali awaj me gaana jarur gayenge.

But kabhi dhang se vartalaap nahin hui...reason again same - diff section, diff hostels. It was in third year, we came in contact aur phir toh dostana kafi phala bada. Janab compromise nahin karte. Agar abhi padai karni hai toh koi lakh mana lo, ye banda tas se mas nahin hoga. kafi logon ko gyan baanta hai inhone. aur inki mahima ka bakhan sabhi log karte hain. And I always felt comfortable in his company , thats why I used to knock on his door every now and then. Milke kayi movies bhi dekhi, wo baat alag hai janab beech mein hi so jaatey the. <br>He has sheer dedication to his work.And is so pure to his heart.

Mai usse humesha ye hi request karta rehta ki kabhi mujhe bhi pada diyo and he was like haan haan zarur, aaja ichaa anusar. Fir sixth semester mai we took same course, DDBMS. He made all of us pass the course. Har midsems ke pehle padana, code issi ke dikhana naam badal ke, assignemts issi ke chaapna. Aur fir jab se issne padana shuru kiya, meri cg 6 se 7 ho gayi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I became a 9 pointer. Kaash tune first year mai padaya hota! That was the time we came close to each other. Tab se aaj ka din hai. Alok se din mai ek baar bina mile kuch adhura sa lagta hai. Isko dekh ke ek alag si hi energy aati hai. Naam se hi ek taza tarang si chhutti ho. To be very true mere liye ek parchhai hi kaafi hai. I stand by what i say. <br><br>He is soft, calm, cooperative, humble, true, genuine, confident etc. You are one in millions. There are infinite moments that i have cherished with you. Some among those are BC at mushroom rock, riding whole night from college to nampally to secunderabad to paradise in the hunt of food and finally pure hyderabad mai ek omelet wala mila. And above that it was during our placement season. I will miss your company as you will leave for blr soon.

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Alok or "Ganja" is  among the most helping people here in IIIT. I first met him in the zoo outing we had in first week of IIIT and we since we both are not so sidhe-sadhe like Pankaj and Ankush  at that time. We chatted while walking behind them. First he was kinda shy and introvert types but then once he knew that I am more like him. He told me classic non-veg jokes, I don't remember jokes but I do remember I laughed like hell. After than its like we used to hang hamesha. He used to teach us all the subjects in first sem, used to proxy our attendance our yoga <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, thanx 4 dat (as I didn't have to run in morning these days). He is never a fan of any computer game however we played that "jumping bird" flash game a lot. He is a dedicated bathroom singer , often chooses songs among "kala kauwa" or some rajesh khanna movie or Veer zaara "Mein yahoon hoon yaahan" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Has a bad voice and you really want to go bathroom someother time to bath,just to avoid his awesome concert.I wonder why we not used to hang-out more often in 2nd or 3rd year <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. I guess may be because of the courses you have taken and me watching movies all the time. Altough the walk and discussion we used to have were cool and interesting. In 7th sem , the placement questions we used to solve was really interesting and fun. Your preparation for placement inspires me to study and prepare for the placement. I know the placement season for you was stressing but I always knew you will crack them in first few days and did it. I was very glad , the day, you were selected and more happy when i learnt the company is in B'lore <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. The 8th sem is kinda fun and I think we are enjoying it too max. The hang-out with gang at CS for 2-3 hrs is really entertaining . Kudos to our spirit and dedication for BC at CS <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>continued....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>	 He is kinda cool or I say "cooldude". Like every Bihari he is hardworking,sincere and dedicated towards his acads , have a special way to teach ...... the example he take while teaching is mind-blowing <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.The helping nature of him makes him gem among people aur I say "Ladka heera hain" <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.Apart from acads, he plays Basketball, a good athelete, very creative, not  at all lazy(proof: Daily subah 5 baje gym jaata hain <img src=Smileys/41.gif />). When comes to girls , he is very soft, don't want to hurt anyone and I think he prefer simple desi girl.I hope you find such girls from Bhumihaar Brahmin community very soon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and get maried by 2010 <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> When comes to galz I know we linked you to gal here in IIIT, sorry if it hurt at you any point of time. Knowing us I hope you took everything lightly and sportingly.Lately he has started reading all types of novels from premchand to Agatha Cristie to Godfather. Not a big fan of movies tough usually watch all the hindi ones. Coming to academics I think he is among the sincere students of our batch <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Never misses classes unless he is bound to do so <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The whole batch appreciated how you saved the trouble of coding "Ftp"  code, I guess everyone copied that code from you. For me the you taking the DWDM was realy treat. I don't have to bother about any assignments/project... "Alok hain naa" and you always does it.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>As you are placed in B'lore I am sure we will be in touch and hang-out as we do now or may be more often <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.I don't recall your ambition or lifelong goal but whatever it is I hope you will acheive it.Best of luck for that.<br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your helping nature, BC at your room, Your way of giving example while explaining things<br>Most Memorable moment : - Zoo outing, BC at ur rum , Golconda trip etc.<br>Msg for U: - Be more confident and Focus while you do something.<br>Song for U:- Rampur ka vasi hoon mein ramkishan hain naam <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
