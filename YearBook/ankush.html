<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ankush Kalkote aka Maratha Warrior.....the ten pointer. Extremely hard working, intelligent, dedicated, down to earth, soft-spoken person. I didn't spend much time close to him, but still we had many outings together in the last 2 years.<br><br>He taught me TOC. I was really amazed by the way he built his concepts about anything and then helps other in understanding them <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> This was proved when he got an intern in Google and then a PPO. Apart from academics, he has no less knowledge than anyone else in IT, Business and various others sectors. I really admire him for that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Always keeps on smiling, makes everyone around him comfortable...he is a Gentleman. Always be the same dear...all the best..and stay in touch.<br>Take Care</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>sweetest guy who always welcome you with a smiling face. In the first year we are in the same wing (cellar. NBH C-18). He is next to my room. He is sooo coool. never saw angry on his face. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Then I was surprised to see his marks. He is very good at acads.<br><br>You deserve the best. Google is lucky to have you. All the best. Heard that you got a GF <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. enjoy<br><br>miss you <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kalkote the favourite of many here in college. Atleast he is one of my favourite. I know him since the first mid-sems. Somebody was telling 'kya padna kalkote hai na ek raat mai sab karadega. Daddu you also come to cellar, he teaches wonderfully'. Bhaiyon seriously iske padane ka tarika and he depth in the subject undoubtedly the best in the batch. I have always admired him for his knowledge. Finally he has proved and google took away our jewel. <br><br>Recently we had an excursion to Bastar with him, despite his hand fracture he never let us feel anything and he joined in every sport we did. I sometime feel sorry for his accident meri hi bike se gira tha bechara <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>I have hardly seen him tensed or angry, always smiling. Keep it up dude.. I have plenty of things to rite. but time never let me do this. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ankush Kalkote A.K.A. Maratha Warrior, my fellow Google intern <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> is one of the best brains of our batch. We all know that he's a 9 pointer but he is not one of those who just mug up all the courses all the time and worry too much about the exams. He could clear CAT examination and get call from IIM-B just after solving a few mock papers on the day before the exam.<br><br>I have admired him all the time due to his calm nature and friendly behavior. In my first year I've known him for AOE and we used to play together often. After I move to cellar in NBH, we became good friends and used to hang out together and have BC sessions quite often. We became close friends when we started doing our intern together. We used to play lots of foos ball/TT during the intern and have fun. Another thing that I like about him is that he also never gets angry ( at least I havent seen him ). Waise though he looks very innocent and decent but he is also very good at pulling other peoples legs <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>You have a long way to go in your life buddy. Now that you'll be joining Google, I hope we will keep seeing other quite often. Good luck and I hope you achieve great success in life.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Has a very nice philosophical side too. one of the few people with whom I can share books on Vivekananda and stuff, still reads Gita sometime and has some very <br><br>nice books. but all in martahi. Is very calm and composed, knows what he wants from life and tries to achive that. Beech mein kuch time ke liye chahca ka <br><br>student ban gaya tha ye sab chod ke, Thank God wapis aa gaya time pe <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>One of teh best things about him is his uber cool attitude. u can always find a smile gracing his lips. has a grace that calms the whole enviroment <br><br>around him. One of teh few persons jo mere phatto pe bhi hasta hein and promotes them too <img src=Smileys/10.gif />( quadra core <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Had alot of fun in playing comp games with him . He being a lazy guy  won't move his hands fast enough and hence will lose the game but will never lose the smile <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.Had lot of fun in recent time watcing TBBT with u. Is a real sport, has been the host of few of the  best parties we had. Overall banda ek dum mast hein. Chilled to the core <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Now he is among the only few in the group with no female friend. Hope he gets a marathi pretty soon <br><br><br>WIll Miss you for: Watching TBBT with u, kamehameha , my Pj's and u laughing on them and obviously for the knoweldge bacnk u are <br>Most memorable moment:first year age, ceaser and similar games , Tbbt  <br>Msg for u: perfection stay the same<br>Song for u: mein huin bond</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Ankush Ashok kalkote:<br><br>Maratha that's the name I normally call him with. I first met him most prob in pankaj's room. He and pankaj used to study together. I think he used to <br><br>grimace and get uncofortable around me in the start.  I remember hiw he was reading a book on robotics in the very first week in library and how I pulled his <br><br>leg on that for a long time. He was very very angery at me for that (In my defense I never knew this will amke him angery <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ). But besde thesse early <br><br>hiccups oer friendship grew strong over years and now we are great pals.<br><br>First look at ankush and he looks like a sweet , inncocent child and he indeed is <img src=Smileys/13.gif />,  yeah yeah yeah u might not belive it but I can prove it. Who else will <br><br> come to my room when I am "goku" and say "ojas ek bar wo ka me ha me ha" phir se kar ke dikha na <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, who else will sit beside somebody playing a computer <br><br>game for hours and watch the game. We even scrwed a mid term exam in sem 2 together me playing ceaser 3 and he watching me thanks for all that. Had great fun So yes  he is a child and when he is I am his best friend <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He has a very calm soothing voice I am sure he will sing wonderful matahi lullabyes to his children. ( he <br><br>sung one to me once too on request<img src=Smileys/10.gif />). one of the best things about this guy his the way he gives u moral support for doing all the stupid stuff u wanna do <br><br><img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He even joins u in it.Perfect pal <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. One of the worst:- 18 ghante lagatar so sakta hein <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Hmm iske tutes to legendary hein. One of the most gifted brains in IIIT. and kattha bhi mast hein pata bhi nahi chlata. Google is lucky to have him. ( wisj u <br><br>were in my team in MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Bande ne bina padhe IIM crack kiya. Baki sare batch ne 4 saal mehnat ki bande ne 4 din and he still scored better <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Has a innate understanding for subjects other run from ( CO , DLD , EC etc etc!!). I remember the diagram in Co which u made for CO and the whole copied it but noboy could understand a thing <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and despite all this nobody ever heard a proud word for him<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Is prud of his culture and language.

He was the one who consoled me after my first interview, also encouraged me not to give up and try my level best in the next one <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . We were an awesome pair in foosball, we used to kick others ass <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...<br><br>I will also remember him for his tutorials during Economics course <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, got a B- because of him else would have got a F/D <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Google mein aish kariyo dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... will miss you and your smile <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kalkote aka Maratha Warrior, one of the gr8 bonds of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> (studies mein aur frastape mein <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). The only guy who got a call from IIMB by solving a few AIMCAT papers <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and also got placed in Google. I think ... now I shouldn't explain anything further in the department of studies as it is quite clear <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Now come to the other department .... Girls <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... bhut frastoo hai. Hope you remember the  scrolling down a Pic incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. If any person of our gang finds him with any girl or just wandering near or around a girl ... iski buri trhaan se fatt leti hai and after that its really very funny to hear the excuses he makes <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Few days back he lost the control of his bike because of these kind of things and broke his arm (kya karen "Dil hai ke Manta nahi" <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br><br>He has unique style of walking ... we call that an elephant walk <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (door se he pta chal jata hai ki Kalkote aa raha hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). You can always find him in his room listening to Old Hindi songs .. kabhi room se bahar he nahi nikalta.<br><br>The best thing about him is that I always find him with a big smiling face <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ... and also laughs a lot, always finds a thing to laugh about. He always remain cool minded about most of the things but manages to complete them in time <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is good at CZ and AOE .. use to play by the name "maratha warrior". <br><br>We went to bastar together and it was gr8 to have him as company .. it was gr8 fun ...good to see his enthusiasm and adjustable nature <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. We are going to stay in the same flat .. so I think I won't miss him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. It will be fun having his company. Can't forget the food in the Yuktahar mess ... had a lot of fun thr <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Wish you best of Luck for your future ... we will always be in contact so don't worry <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Oye Kalkote aka Maratha Warrior ,<br>tu to meri testi likhega nahi..socha main hi likh deta hoon.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Yaar my testimonial might be short and simple but i'll write what i really think about u.<br>Starting main to muze lagta tha ki  tu mand buddhhi hai...but as time passes and grades were out, i realized it was me who was mand buddhi and on the contrary kalkote is one of the most sharp minded guy of our batch. He thinks about the right way to do things  rather then executing them straigtaway. We had very formal relation for around 6-7 semester but in around last semester same floor par rahne se thoda jyada contact main aaye and started enjoying each and every meeting.<br>We alwasy have very unique and different type of chat, no matter what the topic is, we always talk about that logically and try to figure out things we can laugh at <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , and really i m loving it. <br><br>Sometime i think he is very good friend of mine but somtimes sala thodi distance bana leta hai. Par jo bhi ho...banda bada hi awesome hai... CAT fod ke isne prove kar diya hai ki he is the Best !!<br>Got placed in Google and i hope ki daily muze (along with mux) lunch ke liye invite karega.  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Likhne ko to bahut kuch hai but jitna bhi likhoonga...ultimately overall sense wahi rahega. I wish we have  lot more to talk about and share in the time to come<br><br>Do remember me as a funny guy and good friend of yours <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Don't forget to invite me on ur marriage party. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Yes, this guy is very sharp, very intelligent and yet, down-to-earth. Bahut hi down-to-earth banda hai. Kabhi attitude nahi dikhayga. Ultimate cool bhi hai. Never seen him taking tension for anything at all: be it exam or interview or MS Open Source presentation <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> for that matter. I find a lot of similarities between me-Adi and Banga-Ankush groups. In both of the groups, dono hamesha saath saath rehte hain, saath-2 enjoy karte hain, saath-2 projects karte hain aur saath-2 hi courses lete hain. Dono ka hi BTP MS Open Source se funded hai. Talking about Ankush, his CGPA, placement, getting a call from IIM-B (without even preparing for CAT, maine tujhe dark-horse predict kiya tha, yaad hai na <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) are a testimony to his intelligence and sharpness. Aur is bande ne jo CO padhaya tha, vo main kabhi bhi nahi bhool sakta. Simply awesome. Thanks a lot for that buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And yeah, thanks for helping us out in Middleware project as well <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hamesha haste hue milta hai ye banda.  Google is lucky to have you. Keep rocking. Never change yourself. You are an amazing guy. I'll never forget all the bc we did especially before MS Open Source presentations and while working for trimaran in Compilers lab. All the best for all ur future endeavours.

<b><a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I didn't know much about this guy in first year. All I knew was that he used to teach some stuff during mid/end sems and I used to cram whatever he said. The only interaction we had was during AOE games, outings or classes may be.<br><br>But we came really close in second year when I moved to NBH. He is damn good at studies and is damn interested in computer hardware just like me. I can't forget the times when we both used to spend hours browsing the websites like newegg looking for best hardware and finding out best value for money hardware with no money in hand <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>He is an intel fanboy and I am an AMD fanboy. Now you know what should have happened. We used to occasionally fight about which one is best. I don't know why but we have an extremely good compatibility index. He also follow all the tech news on the slashdot and similar channels. In our group, he is the only guy with whom I can talk all the tech stuff everyone.<br><br>I am not going to write about any social stuff here because all that is obvious part as he is a very good person at heart and always ready to help and what not blah blah ....<br><br>Keeping in mind the above stuff, I can surely say that this guy has a huge share in making me a tech savvy.

He has been consistent in studies throughout his college life. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Not only he studies well <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> but also teaches us (i.e. his batch mates) just before examination so that we can perform better. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He also taught me a few subjects such as Compilers, TOC, Cryptography etc. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I am really thankful to him for all the help he provided to me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has been an inspirational source for me throughout the college life. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> One thing for which I appreciate him the most is not his intelligence but how perfectly he takes it's use. According to me, everyone in the world has been gifted an excellent brain, but there are a few who perfectly use it to let others feel the vibe of their intelligence and no doubt, Ankush is among those. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Job in Google and passing CAT (written) are the proofs of his brilliance. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>In spite of all these qualities, he has some shortcomings as well. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> He can't tolerate his criticism especially from Ojasvi. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> If a man is a master in a single field, then it does not mean he can be the master in other fields by default. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> According to me, he just wishes to hear praises from others for whatever he maneuvers and if someone criticizes him, then he starts thinking how can this person make a fun of me when he is at a lower level than me in studies. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br><br>I have shortcomings too. And one which he pointed out is that I get excited very quickly. He is totally correct about that. And I am trying to overcome that shortcoming. I am really thankful to him for pointing that out. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He has really been a nice friend to me. And he even tried to teach me MARATHI (his mother tongue). He never refused to me for any kind of help. He is really a great friend. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Wish you a very good luck.

This marathi manoos, must be one of the most gentle and soft spoken guy I have ever met in my life.<br><br>Another one of my cellar mate, will always remember his and Sachin's room just beside ours. All the times there used to be the sound of some or the other game being played in the room and ofcourse all the immensely helpful tutes which were a lifeline for many of us. I have seldom seen a person who had such a hold over the concepts and the subject never mattered. Even in our 4th year we went to him to study Middleware, a course which he took last year, and yet, he was as always ever complying and ever so clear on the concepts... Just too good man!!<br><br>All the best for your future man..<br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Stay in touch</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Two things I'll always remember about Ankush. The way he laughs for every little joke <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . And the way he smiles and speaks to people. Can anyone get more soft spoken than him?<br><br>I've not had much interaction with him, but whatever little I spoke to him in the cellar, he was fun. And brilliant. I remember asking him to solve an iffy problem in EC once.. He did it in a jiffy! I remember that in cellar, everyone, including Banga and Sambhav would go to him for doubts. And there was nothing which he could not clear. The way he cracked Google and CAT - a testimony to his brilliance.<br><br>I am sure you'll do well in life, you'r far too good! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Sidhu? <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: BC in cellar<br>Message for him: You can be more outgoing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ankush Kalkote <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> A very simple and light hearted person, always remains happy. Is extremely talented and very much down to earth. A gem of a person <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />(zyada ho gaya lagta hai). <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>It was day one of college when Ankush, Sachin, Kabeer and me met for d 1st time outside BLN's office. Luckily we got rooms together and that too in NBH cellar <img src=Smileys/1.gif />(awesome BC place). I remember him being part of our discussions on ragging stories of our batch. He looked innocent but <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . We all used sit together in Pankaj's room and our BC used to last till late nights. We all together used to go to Akansh sir's room to watch movies. The 1st impression of him not being ordinary guy came to me when he explained to me some concepts of DLD. And I would admit tht his excellence was a driving factor in initial stages of our friendship. I had a repent I couldn't do my ITWS 3 project with him <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but that's now won over by our 2 year long association in all our major graduation projects <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Ab to apni team itni strong hai ki, koi bhi project ho, 2 din mein to hum kar hi denge (ab kaise woh to hmein hi pata hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) But haan shayad logo ko sach nahi pata ki kaam hamesha Ankush ne hi kiya hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> We together have been through many good as well as bad times, but it always relieved me when he said, 'tension mat le yaar' .He has always been very supportive and is my lifeline in wanting times. Please don't change <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>I believe its tough to be my friend as people have to bear with me for many of my strange habbits and he has done that without ever showing it. Hey, I am sorry for not being in the campus for recent times but our friendship still remains d same. aur haan ghar paas mein hi lena.<br><br>He loves Marathi, often hears Marathi music and reads Marathi news and books. Loves his culture, his family.<br><br>I won't b wrong if i rate him as one of d best brains in d country <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. His interview call from IIM Bang was not luck but talent (he prepared as much for it as we do for 8th sems exms). Neways this wasn't a surprise for me. </b></i></ul><br><br>

I wud just write a code.. and it wudn't work.. and I wud hand it over to ankush.. and he wud make it workable enough to upload it <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ... <br>we used to watch so many 'videos' at akansh sir's compu ... we used to call it our 'chitrahaar' <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. and it's only there we had our first experience of some 'rated' videos <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>he's always been around in all our outings though it was not always easy to detect his presence... he's always been the quite types when in gang.. but when he gets going.. (which he has been doing off late... pulling alok's and banga's legs) he joins the celebration wholeheartedly.. <br><br>one peculiar thing to notice about him is his attitude... and his way of presenting himself.. at first you wud find him to be a 'pretty laid back' .. 'lazy'  kinda guy... and it's true too to some extent... I mean look at the way he walks.. 'mast haathi wali chaal' <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. sleeps a lot... I mean that's what I find him doing most of the times when I knock at his door.. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>most of the people know him and appreciate him because of all the tutorials he has taken over the 3-4 years to teach almost everyone who comes to him... but let me give you the inside stories <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>he is dexter... he knows how much a particular guy needs to know.. so no point in teaching him more or complicated..

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The Honor of getting my first testimonial goes to My Ex-Roomie "ANKUSH" Or "Maratha Warrior"[as he call himself <img src=Smileys/10.gif />].So, It stated with my first day at IIIT-H(how can I miss that H) in front of Appaji's office I met this guy all alone and looked the same (minus the devilish smile which he has now) the simple innocent,nerdy guy <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> with spects and a file. I went to him and talked for a while , since we don't have any known friends ,we decided to take the room together, He is highly intelligent , soft spoken, ever smiling, lazy (less than me) and fun to be with. Sharing a room with him was fun, He never argues with you over silly things, infact I don't remember we ever had a fight/argument; he wakes you up for all of your classes. The special perk of being his roomie is you don't have to bother about toughest of subjects like CO, EC, OS, and Compiler etc.I wouldn't have passed even HSSMs like economics and ITS if you haven't thought me. The way he teaches it makes everything seems easy and logical <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  I remember in the second sem we used to decide that tomorrow we will miss all the classes and used to sleep upto 12 hrs at a stretch. The AOE, CZ and all those flash games we used to play was really entertaining . Fan of Animated and Hindi movies .He usually divides the film in three parts and watch them separately like they do in DD1. He must have "Ab tak chappan" in more than chappan parts <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He use to talk with someone when he is asleep and some day I remember you shouted in your dream[ that too in marathi]<img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>		 He is one of few 10 pointers from our batch <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Avid follower of Slashdot, Technorati and all those tech sites. He cracked two of the hardest interview i.e. of Google and Microsoft <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Google made him wait for three long months <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, He was seen frustrated every time some1 asks him about the result. It was great day when he got the result and treat was really awesome . Loved the Party <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
