A perfectionist (<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) I must say- her dedication to work is unparalleled. Someone who has a heart as pretty as face because the mission she is heading now is something which is very absorbing. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> And the most appreciable part of it is she has taken it up as her career ..how many would forgo life abroad with an awesome profile for the sake of social service? <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I(We all ofcourse) take pride in being friends with you da! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Enough of praising now..<br>She is a real crook..

LOL at her expressions at that time!<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>2.  The day when you wrote the shortcut of *some* word. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Embarassment at its heights!<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>3. Your 2-year cousin Bhavya[Hope I am not wrong] came and talked to us in felicity..OMG!<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>4. Somebody drew a watch next to her name in attendance sheet one day. <img src=Smileys/24.gif />  <br>5. The wonderful discussions we have in mess daily <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I really enjoy them.<br>Deeps, I really cherish our friendship and will certainly miss you. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>And yeah, Hum dosth the, hein or rahenge.. hameshaa ke liye <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

[A sign of shy,not because of my attitude! <img src=Smileys/1.gif />] <br>But okkasari conversation antoo start ayyaka, enta dobbina em anadu.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Kopam,kopam antaru kanee enni sarlu edipinchina eppudu tittaledu[ nijamga nee kopam etla untundo choodalani vundi naaku <img src=Smileys/4.gif />]<br>Extremely talented and is workoholic-he is a super nerd. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Bipin sir ki anduke anta tondaraga pet ayyipoyadu! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>I really wish we ALL were together from our first year.

<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Well, I cant help mention your testimonial brought some moisture to my eyes. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>This is one of the sweetest surprises I've got till date!<br>One of the strongest evidences that made me believe in a thing called destiny is Srirang.<br>We were together for an year in school, two years in intermediate and four years here in IIIT.<br>Srirang is very friendly and very very CUTE. You cant help it ya, you're born this way <img src=Smileys/1.gif />! Especially the one in pic Jalaluddin Ranga,<br>	Two funny incidents which I can never forget are:-<br>1.	The first time when I greeted him in IIIT, He merely ran away from the place saying "YES!". <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>2.	When we were passing by NIFT, he (with a big wide grin on his face) said "maa college!"  LOL! <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>I wish you the very best for your future!<br>Hope you get a girl friend as cute as you <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and yeah, I will be the first one to feel happy on hearing this. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I don't want to explicitly mention "Stay in touch". Destiny's on our side! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sugar,Spice and everything nice- these were the ingredients God used to create His child. He accidentally added chemical X and thus Spandy was born. Took the help of this dialogue from powerpuff girls because I always get reminded of this whenever I see her. All 13 of us keep wondering what it must have been that keeps Spandy's creative brain on run.Please don't thrash me now because I called her creative<br>    She is the one whom we all adore as the most reliable friend. Has never said a "NO" to anybody and is ALWAYS ready to help. Works hard and is very sensitive. Looks cute and gets more pretty when she blushes.  Spandu, Stay the same because you're the best this way! <br>Remember  that one of your best fans is here in IIIT and keep in touch with her!<br>Ending this with her jokes:<br>1.	What does a lazy father name his daughter?<br>Answer is "Push""Pa" <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>2.	X: Raa raa..mess ki rara..<br>Spandy: Chaka chaka chaka( Laka laka laka laaga !) <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>3.	Y's Status mesg: Wish I had a time machine<br>Spandy: contact Aditya at room no:369 <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I loved this one like hell!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the first guys I talked to is Bk! Not a big issue but we had a serious fight back then and we stopped talking to each other for an year or more.<br>Unknowingly, bava helped us in setting things right and ever since, we are friends. Bk is a very good listener and is the treasury of victories and sorrows of many<br>sentimental fools like me. He is a good dawg[Hope everybody knows why!] and am sure he will succeed in building a bright career.<br>He is also a good cricketer[Sorry, cannot say anything more for I am totally ignorant here]. A small poem for you!:-<br>Another true friend,<br>a friend of life-time,<br>A man of virtue<br>and a heart sublime.<br>Enough of praising!<br>He is a big crack.<br>bad at jokes,<br>A funnybone-his lack!<br>Do keep in touch,<br>just as you said!<br>Heres wishing you<br>good luck all ahead. <br>Sorry if i ever hurt you <br>and sorry for the awful poem too. <img src=Smileys/4.gif />(Guess these two lines are better!)<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Navs is a super gal. Very soft-spoken and truly sensitive. Pretty in her own way <img src=Smileys/3.gif />-her fan following says it all<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>She is absolutely fun to be with. Loves sleeping more than me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and  stays cool no matter how important the time may be!<br>Has got admits from two good universities <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and she is flying this summer! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>Navs, Please keep in touch! I will miss you da. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>Good luck for all your future endeavors! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;<br>We conspire,<br>We admire,<br>We'll retire together. (Hopefully!)<br>We respect,<br>we reflect,<br>Each is true to another.<br>We laugh ,<br>We chaff,<br>Sad or happy be the weather!<br>We love being this,<br>the feel of friendly bliss,<br>We'll surely miss each other!<br>PS: Mistakes are to be excused da<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Lyddu, Will miss you for the awesome coding competition, your mother's chakkara-pongali, badminton(We played couple of times,remember?),tasty fried rice and dosas and most of all every second I spent with you! wish we'll have many more memories to cherish in the coming year!<br><br>yours Honey <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nammu is one of the few girls whom I look upto. She is Bubbles when it comes to powerpuffgirls, Barkha Dutt when it comes to discussions, IBNLIVE when it is news-updates, Sobha Naidu when it is dance, an old friend whom you met after several years-when it is chit-chatting, Shakespeare when it comes to story telling and is herself when it comes to Federer or Justin Timberlake or Liverpool. She used to stay next to my room in first year and we thereby have many sweet memories to share. I used to play a tragic song early in the morning and now I understand how badly it must have hurt her. She plays equally awful songs to avenge that torture <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It is truly fun to be with her for she is a very good speaker and listener. Cannot forgot those fun-filled times when we used to walk to indira nagar to lose fat and have Chinese manchurian there <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, the late night journeys from VJA-HYD, munching more and more food in balaji and IEG and awesome games we play in IEIR classes. Hatsoff to your questionnaires! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> If there is anything more I would her for-I will have to write my whole 4-2 here because I'm sure we will have wonderful time together. Cant help mention that 4-2 did wonders to her! <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> It rendered some sweetness to this kid's life for which she is all smiles these days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>PS 1. Wish you the very best there <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>   2. I beg you to stop teasing me about something because I'm over it now. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>   3. I'm sure we'll keep in touch for various reasons.  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ambati.html>Bharat Ram Ambati</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I dont really know how to start this with. I am in always in the same dilemma when I think of what brought us together. He is bundle of emotions personified. A real GEM of a person who hardly gets angry.There are couple of  times when I hurt him and yet, he with a simple smile forgave me for all those without a word.He stands first with a helping hand whenever I'm in trouble. One of my close friends to whom I spill my heart out, he  knows the deepest secrets of my life. I report to him each and every incident as any sister would do to her brother! And he would PARSE it in his own way, extract the POSITIVES and NEGATIVES from it and generates RULES for me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  . He is that geeky! He is the best tutor both UNPAID and PAID for many courses in IIIT. Though he is such sharp and intelligent in academics, he can be cleverly outwitted in everywhere else for he is such stupid. Has a love story from school and has not taken a single step towards it but gives lame excuses when asked why. Yeah,I know I am not fit to say this <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>Like brother,Like sister!  <br>There are some things that I would certainly miss when I leave this place. Ambu[As WE-Gang proudly call him] and his item-ness  are two of them <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Oh what a testimonial by Sussu..<br>I'm really very impressed ya..really!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This girl is a complete crack. She is both-beauty and the beast.Believe me, She has got all those qualities which can drive anybody mad. Stands first in cracking jokes <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and if there's someone who doesnt find them funny, he should consult a doctor. She is high most of the times but certainly has mood swings as we all do. Gets angry really soon and calms down equally fast. Looks very cute when she cries,cuter when she is ok and cutest when she smiles. Her comebacks are mostly one-liners which set us laughing like pigs. She's also smart and has a good brain but barely uses it. She likes "CHILL"ed guys and often bugs me(rather insults me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) about my taste. She looks equally deceptive because a person who sees her for the first time would think she is a real geek and is very silent. I still remember the first day when I asked her name, she merely said "Divya" and I cursed myself for meeting a boring person. Later, I was taken aback when she spoke to me and am still surprised how she manages to strike a good conversation with anyone and keep it interesting till the end. She hardly talks to guys! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Overall, she is certainly that one person everyone would love to be with. Last but not the least, she has a very nice nose and an enviable complexion. em bava kummesana? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Did I mention that she looks "pretty when thin"?<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harshi has got awesome selection skills.<br>-> Her Gmail-id: cuteharshi.iiith which is very true to her. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>-> Her Crush: * who looks like very ideal as her pair <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>-> Her ear-rings and t-shirts: Awesome collection of them. Her room is a mini shopping mall for we-gals <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>-> Her hair-style: She has got lovely hair.<br>-> Her friends: No wonder I'm her first friend here. Remember the mattress shop <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>She is a dynamite and sets the atmosphere around on fire. Is super cool but looks quite opposite <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Is extremely caring and a true kid at heart. She is a real chick, sings like a nightingale and dances like a peacock-> Awesome for bird-watchers. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>All in all, Harshi is one of those whom I feel I'm destined to meet. Hope more is in store for us in the coming year!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramya.html>Ramya Yaragani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ramya is ideally that one girl whom every mother and father would like to parent[ stands top in class], whom everyone would like to befriend[very caring and understanding] and whom everyone would like to bug[ Always smiles back but never retorts]. Beneath a "kasi" shell, she is  a romantic person and has a sweet story which she keeps telling us daily. Has a "sametha" on her lips for every damn situation. Sweetly termed as "Kasi devatha" of our batch, Ramya shares the honour of first girl-GOOGLE-ian of IIITH. <br>("Oorike vastara mahanubhavulu"?).I owe my C++ to her, for she literally nurtured me with every single concept with lots of patience. Cannot forget those wonderful times when we travelled to VJA together[We stood for the whole 6-hr journey once!]. One of my best friends whom I'm really proud of and Sorry if I ever hurt you dear! Please keep in touch because I never want to lose you.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Yo aussie!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Some scholar said:- 'Wherever you are, it is your friends who make your world'. I seriously heed to this because ever since I met this girl, she has become my world. Three long years have passed away and we don't even remember what it must have been that got us so close. Alter-ego is the best title I can give her, for she acts the same as I do. She has a real tender heart and a pretty smile that is very precious for we-friends. We proudly share the memories of late-night-movies in workspace, sleep-early movies in my room, pizza huts and chutneys, Combined studies for the exams and assignments, personal evaluations in AI, spree for shopping and baskins-icecreams, DSNR bustop and our very old 217-D. With all these in mind and tears filled in eyes,We are heading for a new era hoping to keep in touch in every second that is ahead. Its really hard for me to put in words the love I have for you. I can only promise you my friendship for life-time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
