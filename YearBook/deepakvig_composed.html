<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kalkote aka Maratha Warrior, one of the gr8 bonds of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> (studies mein aur frastape mein <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). The only guy who got a call from IIMB by solving a few AIMCAT papers <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and also got placed in Google. I think ... now I shouldn't explain anything further in the department of studies as it is quite clear <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Now come to the other department .... Girls <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... bhut frastoo hai. Hope you remember the  scrolling down a Pic incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. If any person of our gang finds him with any girl or just wandering near or around a girl ... iski buri trhaan se fatt leti hai and after that its really very funny to hear the excuses he makes <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Few days back he lost the control of his bike because of these kind of things and broke his arm (kya karen "Dil hai ke Manta nahi" <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br><br>He has unique style of walking ... we call that an elephant walk <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (door se he pta chal jata hai ki Kalkote aa raha hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). You can always find him in his room listening to Old Hindi songs .. kabhi room se bahar he nahi nikalta.<br><br>The best thing about him is that I always find him with a big smiling face <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ... and also laughs a lot, always finds a thing to laugh about. He always remain cool minded about most of the things but manages to complete them in time <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is good at CZ and AOE .. use to play by the name "maratha warrior". <br><br>We went to bastar together and it was gr8 to have him as company .. it was gr8 fun ...good to see his enthusiasm and adjustable nature <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. We are going to stay in the same flat .. so I think I won't miss him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. It will be fun having his company. Can't forget the food in the Yuktahar mess ... had a lot of fun thr <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Wish you best of Luck for your future ... we will always be in contact so don't worry <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harshita, I like to call her 'Moti' (easiest way to irritate her <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) as she is always worried about that ... does exercise, goes for a long walk day and night <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but when it comes to the food ... she never leaves anything <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. I hv seen her sitting in the mess for a long time <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>When it comes to talking then I think ..no one can beat her in talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. When you are with her, you don't have to worry about what to talk and what not to <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. she will take care of that. You can talk about anything with her. I have met only a few girls who are very open minded and she falls in that category <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I am a fan of such kind of open mindedness <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> so its always fun talking to her.<br><br>She is one of the few enthusiastic girls in our batch <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ... she sings and dances very well, she has hardly lost any singing competition. She gets very senti when someone says anything about her voice.<br><br>Her cool, friendly and childish attitude makes her outstanding <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Always be like that and keep talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>Best of Luck for ur future ... hope u get ur MS in 5 years <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Keep up the hard work in terms of Exercises ... I am sure .. ek din tum mere se bhi 'patli' ho jao gi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul aka DVD ... the dude with the cool and different attitude <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... with a totally different way of talking (Bihari logon ki yaad aa jati hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). That way of talking always bring a smile on our face <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is very enthusiastic and hard working person of our batch ... chahe log jitni bhi maarte hain is bande ki ... but he never looses enthusiasm <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is from a very small place ... had problem in english so faced difficulties in other subjects too but his never giving up attitude has never let him down ... always fights till he wins <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Mixs up with everyone quite easily and everyone feels very comfortable in his company.<br><br>He is a multi talented person ... very good at Basketball ...tabla and is the rock star and we also call him "Avant Garde" and "californicason" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. His cool and hard working attitude makes him one of the best persons of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>Best of Luck for ur Future ... and keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dharmeet.html>Dharmeet Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>@Dharmeet : its not abt defining friends ... its abt ur views ... nothing is being tested here ... infact it feels gr8 that atleast u think abt other people ... everyone's time is very important and if u can devote 10-15 mins writing abt him then I think u can spend a lot of time with him without even giving another thought <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Take the things lightly and have fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sachin aka KK, the coolest guy (he loves to be called as cool <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) ... he is the person who has always accompanied me on most the trips starting from Kerala to Sikkim and then to Vaishno Devi. I think he loves traveling and that thing match with me ... so when ever I think of going on a trip, he is my first choice ... always enthusiastic <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> about going to one or the other place <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and he rarely back out from the trip <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>He was in the cellar NBH right from the 1st year but I hardly knew him at that time ... either he use to stay in the room (still prefers to do the same <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) .. or play AOE in the lab. When it comes to the games .. he is one of the best player in CZ and AOE. Once I saw him playing AOE in lab .. I got inspired and started playing AOE but even today I couldn't match his level <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. <br><br>He is a wikipedia of Bollywood movies and songs <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and also watches a lot of TV Serials. When ever I needed any movie then he is my first choice who can help as he has a lot of DVDs full of movies and also suggests me those movies that are of my interest (especially comedy or having beautiful bandi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). He is the permanent member of the winning team of Antakshri <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>The most unforgetable moments were the trips to Kerala, Sikkim and Vaishno Devi .. and he is such a good entertainer, never let u feel bored <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is also good at playing cards and it was one of the source of entertainment in trips. He is always full of enthusiasm during the whole trip and tries to get the best outcome from the trip. Thanks to Sachin for the last day of the Kerala trip when he planned to see synagogue <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> otherwise we would have missed a lot of things.<br><br>He has a peculiar style of walking because of which he has got the name 'KK' and always misspells s as sh and vice versa <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is also good at BC but mostly prefers to stay in his room so he misses out many BC sessions. He is true lover of Pizza .. anywhere anytime <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is going to Bangalore so I think i m going to miss my trip partner <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. We hv Goa trip.. pending so be i</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mr. jain... the most talented person in IIIT i hv ever met. I am a big fan of his creativity .. don't know how he can think that way <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Aur iski effciency ke kya kehne .. sab se kam pad kar sabse acha grade kese lana hai ... he knows the best way <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>I know him from Bansal Classes, Kota and from thr our friendship started. We always use to sit in the front row and from thr on the bond between us always strengthened <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is a very cool guy and is full of enthusiasm ... always ready to participate or manage an event. He is a very good singer (always ready with a song and it will surely match the situation <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) and a very good poet. <br><br>Koi aisi domain nahi hai jismein isne haath na daala ho and he is always perfect in that <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He worked really hard when he was the head of the Cultural team of Aakash house <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is good in many games like cricket(with Paul Adams action <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), Volleyball and football and it is the perfect place to see his enthusiasm <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is the member of the placement committee and I think he has spend more time with Mr. Javadev as compared to any other person in the committee. He narrates the stories that he come across in meeting, in the best way <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>He did a lot of hard work in Felicity '08 and he was the one who decorated the whole campus and made it look really beautiful <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>He accompanied us on Sikkim trip and Vaishno Devi Trip and it was a gr8 pleasure to have him on the trip. He is a gr8 entertainer <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. That were the unforgetable moments of my life.<br><br>He got another name 'Tinka' as he can't stay at his place for a longer time. Thodi der mein udd leta hai ... and no one ever have a hint abt where he has gone or when he has gone <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He is always able to maintain a good image in everyone's mind and heart <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Don't know how he is able to do that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Everyone feels very comfortable in his company <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. The most unforgetable incident was the one happened in NTR whr he tried to propose a chinki <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Best of Luck for your future ... will miss u .. always keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Alok aka ganja, vese to apne aap ko Bihari kehte hain per aaj tak decide nahi ho paya hai ki yeh Bihar se hain yaan UP se <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Khud he confujia jata hai is maamle mein <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But the qualities he has ... has made me his fan <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. If I start listing out his qualities then this page will be filled by only that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>His kind and generous nature has always inspired me and I have learnt alot from him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Everyone tries to make comment on Alok and he always takes that in a positive way so most of the time he is the bait <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I remember one quotation "Its easy to laugh at someone but its very difficult make someone laugh at you" ... and he is the only person I have seen in my life who has made that difficult work look very easy <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Initially I felt a bit irritated when people use to do the same thing with me but Thanks to Alok that I am now walking on his path and it feels really great when you make other people laugh <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>If you want a trustworthy friend then he definitely falls in that category. If you want some help or asks him to do something for you then he will surely lend you his helping hand and will always be there till the work is completed. He is also very dedicated to studies always putting his 100% effort in each and every subject <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. You can better understand abt his dedication from the fact that while the college was celebrating Felicity '07 .. he was there in his room studying algorithms <img src=Smileys/13.gif />.<br><br>He takes to much tension when it comes to studies .. but he is enjoying the last semester in the best way. He accompanied us on Bastar trip and he is a very good entertainer .. he can sing (but lyrics ki Maa bhehan kar deta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) .. do BC and will let you feel bored. <br><br>The most memorable moments were when we use to have lunch and dinner in Yuktahar and had a lot of fun with him. He is very compromising by nature ... compromises each and every thing for other ... now he is compromising his Love for Guptha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is one of the few person whom I really respect <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Best of Luck for the future and be in </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhinav aka Paro or SRK ... everyone thinks of Mehta when abhinav name is called <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... his permanent name is Paro know. If you want to learn new styles for photo shoot then he is the right person .. and he will guide you perfectly <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> as you can see from his pic <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>In 1st year, we spent alot of time together as we were of the same type .. we didn't like to speak alot .. kind of reserved nature ... so we became very good friends. He is very hard working person and is always a source of inspiration for me. In 1st sem, he faced a lot of problem because of english as he was from a hindi medium. But he worked really hard and removed that barrier <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is the kind of person who never gives up untill the thing is over <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. That quality has always inspired me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>In studies, I have taken most of the course with him .. even a few project. He use to take a lot of tension regarding the courses ... assignments and exams. Even in the last sem he is taking a lot of tension abt the LP course <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>His favourite hobby is photo session ... you can always see him in different posses when someone is taking a snap. Whenever I use to open the photo gallery of my mobile phone, I use to find only Paro's photographs in that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Till now he speaks very less so rearly take part in BC sessions. He is addicted to tea ... you can see him at CS in the morning, noon, evening and night till the CS closes .. taking a sip of tea <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>He is really good at chatting ... don't know how he made a girl fall in Love with her by chatting only <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. A few girls in career point were also impressed from him because he was topper thr and got one of the top ranks in AIEEE <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>We are in Hyderabad so we will be in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Best of Luck for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Manish aka MUX ... now I think his real name is changed to Mux, no one even recognise him when one speaks out his name as Manish <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is really good person at heart and what ever he has in his mind he speaks out. His peculiar style of speaking always brings a smile on my face. I like that style <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is one and the only person who takes care of each and every portal that is needed for polling. And this yearbook is all his effort. He is very enthusiastic regarding these kind of things. And takes up the responsibility with enthusiasm and always completes it with full responsibility.<br><br>Whenever he is accompaning you ... you can never feel bored, he will always be there to entertain you with his songs (hasn't got that melodious voice but its perfect for having fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and other talks. He accompanied us on the Kerala Trip and that were the unforgettable moments that I spent with you. He was a total entertainer in the trip .. always full of enthusiasm. <br><br>Another memorable trip was the trip to Begumpet Airport where we spent alot of time seaching the beautiful girls and at last we got success ... but could get a pic with them <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. And Mux got very excited at that ... he circled for atleast 4-5 times around them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>We took a course under Bejawada and Mux's first reply to sir's question was remarkable <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.Pure course mein Mux ki fati padi thee ... but till the end we did nothing in that course and he was tense if he will get an F grade. <br><br>He is very honest and trustworthy person ... u can completely rely on him if u hv give him some work <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. While talking .. his expressions are enough to descibe the whole seen <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Best of Luck for your future and always be the way you are <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. College mein aate raheinge tumse milne <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kiran aka dandu, the wikipedia of computer games and Hollywood movies <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Ask him about any game .. he will surely tell you how to begin and how to end the game. He has spent sleepless nights to complete the games. He prefers playing games over attending classes <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>He is very friendly ... and we use to spend a lot of time together in 1st and 2nd year. If I wanted to go to CS for tea or something .. I use to ping him to go along and I always gets a YES as the answer. He got a PC in 1st year and we use to watch movies and other stuff in his room <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>You can always find him in a very light mood ... it can be regarding anything ... from studies to placements <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He never allows any kind of tension to build up around him. With three things he can spend his whole life CS, Laptop and Internet. He has good knowledge about Computers and is very good at programming but he hardly uses it <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br><br>He is really good at DumbC as he knows about each and every HollyWood movie. One of the best players when it comes to CZ (pegasus the shooter <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). He is very efficient in every work ... he has got the brains when it comes to the studies .. but always prefer to use them in games rather than in studies <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>It is very difficult to wake him up while he is sleeping.. I tried it a few times in 1st year when we had to go to class but I hardly got any success. But he is really good at heart and is very honest. <br><br>If you want to go out for lunch or dinner and don't find anybody to go along then you can always ping dandu and I am sure the answer will always be YES <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. You never have to convince him to go out for lunch or dinner .. he is always ready for that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is the only South Indian in our group but he doesn't know Telugu .. every time gets confused about the words. But the way sometimes he answers a few things makes us laugh alot. The way he speaks Hindi is really funny <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Best of Luck for your future and always be in touch </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Maroo one of the most dedicated persons I have met in IIIT <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His dedication can be seen in every work that he takes up. In the first year, when i haven't talk to him for the first time, I thought of him as a total nerd <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ... it might be because of his specs <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Then he moved to NBH cellar and was my neighbour ... after that I came to know that he is really nice guy.<br><br>His dedication and regularity has always inspired me. You can always see his dedication in the cricket field when he is playing cricket. His reactions are awesome while playing cricket. He is the strike bowler of our cricket team aur eski batting ke baare mein to pucheye he maat .. (kyonki vahi acha rahega <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). <br><br>I think he is the person who deserved IIM-A call in true sense. He was the most regular person in the CAT classes and scored really well in every AIMCAT. He is the true bond in DI and English <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  He was the coordinator in Felicity '08 and its all because of his dedication and hard work that we had a really gr8 Felicity and it was best I have seen in 4 years <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>Best of Luck for your future and I am sure you will get the success the way you want ... I would love to see u in the same high spirits always. Always be in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Shikha .. the only punjabi girl I have seen in my college. But I don't know if she knows Punjabi or not <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> never seen her talking in punjabi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>She is one of the few girls in the campus to whom I have talked and I really enjoy talking to her. She is very frank and talking to her is gr8 fun. I always use to tease her about one thing or the other and frustrate her. But she starts crying at the end <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>She is really good at studies ... placed in Google and got 5 IIM calls .. so I think its enough <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and that explains everything about her intelligence. <br><br>In first year we went to Ramoji Film city and we enjoyed alot there. I can remember a couple of other outings where she accompanied us. She is really good at heart and won't let u feel bored while she is along. <br><br>The most unforgettable thing is the chat we had in Summer holidays ... where she got another name 'bandar' ... and after that we use to laugh <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> when ever we saw each other. Yuktahar is the best spot for her BC sessions .. you can always find her doing BC and hardly having her food in Yuktahar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>At the end, I can say that .. she is very sweet and very talkative <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Always be the way you are. As u are in Hyderabad .. same as me .. so be in touch and Best of Luck for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dharmeet.html>Dharmeet Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Dharmeet aka baba ... thats what we call him. He is one of those persons from whom I get the inspiration to help others. He is the most religious and devoted person I had ever seen in my life <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is an active member of the 'Samvedana' and is the person to take initiatives and is doing the thing with full spirits. <br><br>In my Life I have seen many people who are suffering from some problem and always mentioning that thing and always think of that thing as the hindrance in the progress of their life .. but he is the person who always take the things in a positive ways and living his life the way he wants to ... never seen him demotivated because if his problem <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Another thing that inspires me to enjoy my life <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is my Yuktahar partner and after having dinner we use to go for a walk ... we use to talk about hell lot of things starting from college life to social problems to each and every issue that we face in our daily life ... <br><br>He a complete chatter box ... once he starts then he never ends talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... I think thats the reason he impresses a lot of girls in and out of our campus <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. If you want any girls phone number then you can contact baba <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... I tried to learn the ways he uses to impress girls but I am really bad at that <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. We always tease him for one or the other girl <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Other than me .. he is the person who travels alot .. you can't make him stay in the college for more than a week. Every month he plans a trip either to Bidar or Nanded or Sagar or Indore .. and even before coming back, the plan for the next trip is always ready <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is very honest, trustworthy and really good at heart ... if want any help he will always be ready for that (but not in studies ... bhut light hai us maamle mein <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>I would always like to see you the way you are ... we are in the same company so i hope the things will be great there and we will have alot of fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mahaveer aka dulla <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. is the best sports person I hv ever seen in school or college. He can play any game and also plays them really well. He is a big fan of soccer, u can often see him choosing a soccer team on a website(but he is really bad at that .. always chooses a bad team <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>His best time pass is celebrating New Year <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The best thing I like about him is the way he can speak out about his feeling towards any person ..it can be good or bad. He will say what he thinks about u or anybody <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is very generous and caring of nature .. he always keeps me telling new ways abt how to become fat <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>I think he is the only person who has guts to fight and is never afraid of anybody. He is the man of his words <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and sticks to what he has said or done.<br><br>He has rearly talked to any girl in our college so humari trhaan he frastu hai .... but don't think that he is the same in his past life .. He has shared some of the experiences with me in which he was like a hero .. every beautiful girl of his town and in Kota had a crush on him .. after hearing all the incidents I was like wtf!!! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ... how can a girl had a crush on him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Aaj kal jyada ladkiyon ko bhaav nahi deta nahi to college mein bhi GKB ki jga aaj mahaveer ka naam hota <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is the favourate among 2nd year guys .. so we also call him FKD ... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>The best thing I like abt him is the sense of humour he has ... he can make up the things really fast and I m sure that will make you laugh your ass off <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and won't let u feel bored of a single minute. He also dedicated person .. does the things that he likes to do .. except studies <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... with full dedication ...always a source of inspiration for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Always be like what you are ... and be as friendly as u are even after we leave the college. Best of Luck for rest of ur life .. hope u will complete ur MS with in next year. Always be in touch .. we will have dinner in Ohri's Banjara every weekends after I join the company <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.... and don't worry I will sponsor them <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kapil aka bajaj aur baju ... the most dedicated person <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I hv seen in college that might be in terms of studies, basketball or some other stuff <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>He is the best basketball player of our batch and one of the best in volleyball also.<br><br>I talked for the first time when he shifted to NBH cellar ... before that I hv noticed him rearly, I thought of him as a geeky and secretive kind as I have never seen him coming out of his room and having fun or doing any kind of BC. But after coming to NBH most of the prejudiced things changed <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is really good at BC also and of very friendly nature. After that our friendship strengthed when we did summer intership together and now I can say I know him really well <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>In summers we use to go to the office (for internship) together and those are the most unforgettable day with u <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Jeetu use to come along us and we use to have a lot of fun (saying Lucky day <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). We spent whole time while going to Kothaguda sharing our views about different things and persons and also sharing our stories of school time or college that we both have hardly shared with anyone.<br><br>He is a trustworthy person and never hurts anyone thats the best thing I like about him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He can adjust with any kind of person. He was one of the Cachein team members and we had a lot of fun and an unforgetable experience. He was very efficient in making the backend as we did the whole work in a day or two. He had a lot of fun while answering the queries of people.<br><br>He is very supportive and enthusiastic also, he was with us on Vaishno Devi Trip and it was a gr8 pleasure to have him with us <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br><br>In the end, i can say that I m really Lucky to have u as my friend <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Best of Luck for your future. Always be as you are .. it always feels good to be in ur company. We both are in Hyderabad so please always be in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Srirang aka DJ Ranga...The Wikipedia for Music and Movies<br>He is a very enthusiastic, cool, trustworthy person and u can always see him with a big smiling face. One can never feel bored if he is in ranga's company.. he will always be thr to entertain u <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. <br><br>I talked to him for the first time while we were organising Treasure Hunt.. from thr on we were good friends. Kudos to our friendship <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is really the best in making clues. I could never have thought of the clues the way he thinks and makes them. He is such a talented, cool and friendly person that every time I have to organise an event.. the first person comes to my mind as a partner is Ranga. <br>We enjoyed a lot while making clues for Treasure Hunt and Cachein .. we have spent many nights roaming in each and every part of the campus searching for the places whr we can hide the clues. In cachein .. I came to know that he is also very dedicated person <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... he spent a whole night in solving a big matrix question. <br><br>The most unforgetable moments is the trip to Kerala. It was so much fun and as usually he was entertaining the whole batch of 11 people with his songs and bc <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Thr was never a single moment for which we felt bored .. its all because of Ranga. <br><br>And now we both are in same company .. we will surely organise a treasure hunt(if possible) thr.<br>Best of luck for the Future and always be like what u r .. will the same smiling face. Its gr8 to have u as my colleague <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sanket Sharma aka daddu, I also call him guru <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. What can I say about him!! He is a bond in all kind of managerial stuff. I think he can handle any kind of situation and the outcome will surely be the best. I have been going with him on last 3 trips and it was an unforgettable experience. I have worked with him on a project and it was a life time experience. Every time he comes up with a superb trick to get the things done and every time I see him doing that it was like OMG!!! He is a prefect leader and I m a big fan of him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is also very adventurous and enthusiastic  always ready to go to a new place for sight seeing or some adventure. If u are doing any work with him, he will always be thr encourage u. He can convince any one through a presentation (if u hv gone to any trip along with him then u might know <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). He never hearts anyone's feelings. I think kaafi tareef ho gayi ... now lets come to the main points <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Daddu is always our <i>bakra</i> for bumps, can't forget the days in workspace, when ever we wanted to give bumps, daddu was our first choice <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Waise daddu ki lete bhut hain sabhi log <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Aur daddu kaatne aur katvane mein bhut mahir hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Daddu's trip to Australia is pending <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.. he promised us and daddu never breaks promises <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>Thr are many other things and incidents about daddu that can make all people laugh but I think daddu won't be able to laugh after that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>In the end, I can say that he a good friend and if u want any suggestion then he is the right person. Want to have full masti and an adventurous trip then u can completely trust him. <br><br>Best of Luck for your future and always be the same as u r <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>We are in Hyderabad so I hope u have a lot more trips to plan and I will surely join u. Always be in contact.</b></i></ul><br><br>
