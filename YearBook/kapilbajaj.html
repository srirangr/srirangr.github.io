<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>KAPIL BAJAJ -- An exceptionally hard-working and devoted student from my home town,JAIPUR.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I don't know where I stand in front of such guys in terms of devotion towards work. A guy like him devoted his whole mind towards his goal and has achieved it.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is the one who is an inspirational source for guys like me.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> No one was counting on him that he would be among the first ones to get through placements.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> But he has proved others wrong.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> His hard-word bore fruits finally.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has completed his and his family's dream. Kudos to him for that. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>One feature where we stand at two different ends is that he never feels nostalgic <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> about his home whereas I feel nostalgic now and then.<img src=Smileys/10.gif />  <br>In addition to being good at studies, he is also good at sports. He is the captain of our batch basketball team. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Wish him a great future ahead.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Stay in touch.<br>CHEERS!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>KBC was a period and not a name, in which he started to become famous in our batch. A lot more goes to his basket ball skills. With time he switched from one group to other but in this process it has helped him in finding new friends.<br><br>Kuch achi kuch khatti baatein inki. Ek to bhai sahab inhe hamesha haste hue dekho ge. Captain of basket ball team itself tells his stories in sports. You should see him playing how serious he get in the game.<br><br>Bahut BC maarta hai bhai kisiko nahin chhodta. Haan lekin inki lo to ye kam njoy karte hai.. Iss semester mai BC ka aisa shok chhad gaya hai ki naye naye spots dhunde gaye BC karne ke liye. specially the hill top.<br><br>Placements mai inka koi jawab nahin internship ke time se hi bajju bhai placements mai lag gaye the.. koi sa bhi question le aao answer to muh pe rata rehta tha. Inse placement mai ke dauran hum ne bhi kaafi kuch seekha. Aur fir Hamare batch ke placement opener rahe hai. <br><br>Amazon should be proud to take you.<br><br>memories: First project dkdbms humesha yaad rahega.<br><br>good luck for your future. and yeah I have misunderstood you at times and now regret.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is one of the few people in my batchmates with whom I have been since the starting of my stay in IIIT. He was my padosi in GHEB since first year itself.<br>Initially I tried to avoid him because I didn't like his habit of coming to my room and blabbering about what he did the whole day. But whenever I have gone to him for help, he has always helped me, no matter what, if not at that<br>time, then maybe sometime later but he has always helped.<br>He's a hard core Rocky fan. He had and still has this habit or rather liking for singing bollywood romantic songs... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I also admire him for his single minded focus on placements and getting placed in Amazon, along with being a pro in basketball, watching sitcoms and many a times playing AOE with me and others and CZ with many others.<br>I still remember his Michael Jackson moves in a solo dance on stage in freshers '05, partly because I wasn't expecting it to be so good and partly because it was really good !! <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is to get an awesome job inspite of playing so much BB, doing so much BC and watching so many TV shows!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Also, his BCing skills. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>ok..So it's my turn now...I'll be precise<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I interacted with Kapil during 2nd year when i was doing a project and required help in Java Swing. Since I dint know anything abt Java Swing at that time (..and i forgot everything now) i asked for his help. He helped me a lot<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> in that project. <br>...I havn't talked to him much but i know he's a very hard-working guy and works day and night to get something<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He helped me a couple of times during placements and i'm thankful for that<img src=Smileys/1.gif />...moreover he loves playing BasketBall, watching movies and other short movies (for something quick<img src=Smileys/4.gif />). We even had a great time jogging early morning and then working out in the Gym<img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>Just a few suggestions:<br>1) Change ur hairstyle from a chapati (flat) one<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>2) Keep your room clean<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>...You got a great job, you deserved an I wish you Best Of Luck for Everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kapil Bajaj aka Bajju aka KBC<br><br>I regret having very less interaction with him in first three years of my college life. Now I know how good human being and an awesome friend he is ! This guy is very hard-working and intelligent. Placement time par do hi logon ki best preparation thi and those were PK and Bajju. Both got placed on the second day of placement session itself. His placement in Amazon is a tesimony to his intelligence. Maine kabhi socha bhi nahi tha ki bajju bhai hamare itne bade bcbaaz honge. Ye baat abhi pata chali. Volleyball mein Bajju, Bansi aur meri team ko koi nahi hara sakta. Class spiking karta hai. We have become quite good friends in the last semester. I hope this friendship grows stronger in the coming time. Oye, pehle hi bol raha hun, gayab mat ho jaiyo college ke baad. Contact mein rahiyo. Vaise bhi apan Hyd mein hi hain, saath milkar jam kar masti karenge. All the best for all your future endeavours. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish aka novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Kapil aka Bajaj aka Bajju aka KBC aka Kapil Baba</u><br><br>For almost the first three years, he was famous as KBC, the captain of batch BB team. He was famous as the <b>rotlu</b> who despite doing well in exams would keep crying over his grades. He was in GHEB so didnt interact much with him all those years and now when everything is about to end, I rue the fact that I missed out interacting with such a wonderful guy. Most of my interaction with him has been in 4th year when the whole first floor decided to finally shift to OBH after being in NBH/GHEB for 3 years.<br><br>Bande ne placement ke time to fod hi diya tha, alag hi level pe prep ki thi bande ne, sale ki hamesha fati hui rehti thi. You just have to speak out any thing related to Computers and then the guy would keep bugging you until you tell him the question, and then he would embark on a journey to solve the question. The prep reaped its reward and he got through with the highest package in college. Hearty congratulations to you bud <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Sala bande se itna khas interaction nahin hua hai (leaving the final few months) but iske sath feeling hamesha ati hai ki banda mast dost hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Though a very infrequent boozer but have enjoyed all the times when we have been out boozing <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I will always remember the party we went to when I gave my placement treat and the night after I got placed, we went to DLF. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Banda sala placement ke baad se ekdum cool ho gaya hai, koi tension nahin, koi rona dhona nahin <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> bas din bhar masti aur aish, its been such a big pleasure spending time with him. Thankfully you are in Hyderabad, aas pas hi flat lenge yaar and fultoo aish karenge <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but even then will miss you loads man <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Wishing you a very bright future and succesful path ahead <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking.. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>KAPIL BAJAJ<br>The boy that have inspired me with his quick decision taking abilities....<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I met you because I used to come to GHEB to Atul's room and also we share our Rajasthani bond, so this was how we met and talked to each other.From the very starting he used to be engage with himself not talking to many<br>but confined to his GHEB friends. I sometimes used to say come to NBH there are many people there and he is like<br>"I don't care"...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. No worries he did most of his hard work there in GHEB and then entered NBH and till then <br>he has already carved a niche into people's mind by his coding and technical knowledge. Thanks to somani who must have inspired him and a salute to your hard work. I have always seen you moving forward and learning things without hesitation,<br>for that if you had to take number of projects or different stream of courses or intern or anything you tried all and no <br>wonder your hard work payed to you and gifted you amazon as a job offer. One of the most thrilling thing was when,<br>while I was calling you and you replied from bathroom and when I reached there you were drinking raw egg one by one <br>for your physique sake,I wondered that time how could anyone ( among us) do this and you said that you were inspired by rocky<br>movies <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . I took your help during placement time and I am really thankful to you, you really helped me dude...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>One point that I don't like about you is sometimes ( not always) you do your work and when your work is done you leave your<br>friends when you could help him. But now a days I can see you got some better meanings of friendship...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Its good to see the change from the kam bolne wala gheb guy to the cricket playing,bc karne wala,party mein jaane wala bajaj.<br>I know you are a hard worker and you are also a good judge of which work to take next,keep your good work up and please don't forget me be it for my doubts even...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ye banda sala itna rota tha grades aur padhai ke liye ki irritate kar deta tha, though he maintained a goot CGPA. This was a prime reason ki isse baat karne ka bhi man nahin hota tha. I always ignored talking to him initially because whatever be the topic of chatting, he'll surely bring in grades and studies between. Though this aspect has changed a lot now and he has become more relaxed when it comes to acads.<br><br>He is a total sitcom and soaps freak. there isn't a single sitcom or soap on DC which he has not seen. This chap also knows the names of actresses in the you-know-what-type movies. Leave only name, he also knows the complete biodata of some of them. Bhai sahab music sunke movie identify kae lete hain. This shows his sheer dedication and passion towards you-know-what-type movies.<br><br>Really good at acads and this can be justified by his placement. He got placed on the first day itself and that too with the highest package. I feel this was the time when he actually became relaxed about grades n all.<br><br>We both belong to Rajasthan and its always special to talk to someone from your state or city. We have shared some fantastic journeys to our hometown and its always been fun travelling with him. For the first time he spoke his heart out on the juniors' booze treat and it felt very nice talking to him that nite.<br><br>All in all he is a very nice buddy, who has always been there and I know he will be there for me whenever I'll need him.<br><br>Good luck. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part2: <br>Kapil is an avid programmer and amongst the best in our batch. Apart from programming he also takes keen interest in watching STUFF.<br><br>Back to the past:<br>He and I interacted very little during the first three semesters. Even though he used to come to my room often, since he was a friend of my room partner's, but we talked very little. It was only during the 3rd year when we started to interact.<br><br>B.Tech Project:<br>As a BTP partner i wanted someone who was not only intelligent but also hard working. A few names struck my mind, out of which Kapil fitted the requirements properly. I asked him if he was interested to do the project, to which he readily agreed. <br>Result: We got an A. Thanks Kapil. It was a right decision to have you as my BTP Partner. <br>As our BTP progressed, so did our interaction and from being just 'batchmates' we became friends. <br><br>Kapil, you are a very hardworking person and i can foresee a bright future for you. Best of luck. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part1:<br>I think this is the right time to write Kapil a testimonial, since we have got an A now. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I know Kapil since the first year of college. We were floormates, then we became BTP Partners and finally we became FRIENDS. Kapil has always been a very hardworking guy and it's because of that he is where he is now - Amazon. <br>On a panic scale of 10, i would give him a 7 for his consistent performance ( consistently panicking ). Be it exams, assignments, lab tests, placement preparations ... he's always panicking and i guess people will not disagree. <br>Apart from being good at studies he is also good at sports ( read basketball ) and has represented his house and our college in innumerable competitions. <br><br><i have a class now, i will continue later></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kapil Bajaj hamare batch ka coolest banda hai, itna cool hai ki agar koi mukka bhi maar de tab bhi apna temper loose nahin karta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Maine bhi iske kandhe bahut dukhaye hain (iske anusaar), ise maar-maar kar <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Uske liye yeh mujhe aaj tak sunaata rahta hai, lekin main bura nahin maanta balki ek baar aur maar deta hoon ise <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Banda Rocky ka bahut hi bada fan hai. Aur DC par bhi iska naam Rocky ya Balboa hi rahta hai. Iski life ka pahle ek aim hua karta tha, woh tha Sylvester Stallone jaisi body banane ka (shayad ab bhi hai) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Mujhe bhi gym jaane ki inspiration is se hi mili thi. <br><br>Dance bahut hi awesome karta hai, aur Vayu ko isne first year ki freshers mein kaafi valuable points dilvaye the apne Michael Jackson wale dance ki badaulat <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Lekin uske baad isne dance nahin kiya, aur ladkiyon ki ise dance karte dekhne ki khwahish man mein hi rah gayi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Basketball mast khelta hai aur Vayu ki team ka poora bhaar is bechare ko apne (kamzor) kandhon par uthan padta hai. Lekin uske bawajood bhi yeh ghabrata nahin hai and always gives his best, aur iski isi quality ke kaaran is saal yeh Vayu ki basketball team ko 2nd le aaya <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>First year mein humein iske baare mein pata chala tha ki yeh Somani ka laptop ka bharpoor istemaal karta tha. Jab Somani subah-subah lab se room par aakar so jaata tha tab yeh ek <b><i>poori movie</b></i> dekha karta tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bande ne kayi movies ke dialogues tak yaad kar liye the. Aur recently yeh bhi pata chala ki yeh un movies ke actors aur characters par research bhi karta rahta tha, woh bhi wikipedia par <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><br>BC karne ke ise bahut shauk hai. Agar koi aur shikaar na mil raha ho to apne-aap par hi jokes maarne lag jaata hai. Aur Vayu ki basketball team ki to humne iske saath milkar bahut utaari hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Lekin phir bhi isne kabhi is baat ka bura nahin maana.<br><br><b>Contd..</b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>TV series aur movies dekhna ise bahut pasand hai. DC par pata nahin kaun kaun si TV series padi hain aur isne shayad woh sab dekh rakhi hain. Aur phir unki stories logon ko suna-suna kar logon ko bhi woh series dekhne ke liye majboor kar deta hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Lekin FRIENDS se zyada baar isne shayad hi koi series dekhi hogi. Uske 10 ke 10 seasons yeh kam se kam 8-10 baar to dekh hi chuka hoga.<br><br>Ab thodi academics ki bhi baat kar li jaye. Padhaai mein banda kaafi achchha hai. Grades ke liye hamesha rota rahta tha. Lekin end mein aakar hamesha achchhe gradesle hi aata tha. Thanks mere liye ECD ki seat chhodne ke liye <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, because of that I had the oppurtunity of knowing you and everyone here <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Ant mein ab yahi kahoonga ki thanks for being a great friend <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and wish you all the best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

He has helped me a lot during placements, told me which material to read, important questions, also gave his notes. Also gave me a lot of moral support then.

<b><a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bajaj aka KBC is one of the best guys one would find to do BC with <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. My first impression of him was that of a guy who could only study and study more <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif />..... <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I remember him coding his ass off during the second and third semester (obviously got lots of A's <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)and wondered how could he study so much even greatest qualities in college <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif />??? But as time passed by, I got to know him better ........... <br>One of his greatest trait apart from acads <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> was his ability to play bsktball (one of the best in our collg)...... poor guy had to carry the weight of his team (Vayu <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) on his shoulders <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ........ and even though his team lost, his performance and passion never dipped.... as amazing as ever <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />........ He is one of the most passionate guys in our batch when it comes to sports....... his heart beats for his team (hence made UG-4 bball captain) <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .......... <br><br>One thing I have to admit is his dedication and devotion towards anything he does....... I remember how hard he had prepared for placements........ used to take a number of tutes clarifying others' doubts (Kabra's too <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and also landed himself a plush job in amazon <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> in these times of recession......... you can't help but admire his dedication for the same <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. he was among the first few guys placed in our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>Talking of dedication, KBC is one of the most dedicated viewer of TV series and movies...... talk of any TV series and he has seen 'em all...... biggest fan alive of FRIENDS (has watched each episode at least 10 times <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />............<br><br>Kudos to your dedication and commitment buddy ....... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />......<br><br>Over these years we've become gr8 buddies and have enjoyed the outings we've had (yeah it's true that I have to always give in to the popular demand when going out <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) Hope you go places which I am sure you will.......<br>All the best buddy for the future........</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kapil Bajaj, he is smart, sincere, dedicated ,intelligent, athletic and got highest earning job of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> For me he has grown to be person whom I can share things, depend on and person whom I regret not becoming close in first 3 years <img src=Smileys/20.gif />  For first three years, I knew him only through Bball matches, where we used to leofy him for his house (I think everyone will guess which house it is <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and were the only people from our batch(along with kharkwal) who come for Bball everyday. At that time, when we were not that close friends, but he  always has smiling face (except when someone tells him KBC <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), don't talk too much and very anxious to improve his performance.In summer'08 ,When he shifted to Cellar, we gradually started to spend more time together. He was part of our gang for everything we do. He became more regular member of BC@CS than many of us. Altough he was our client <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/4.gif /> for first few months,  and now he is a big grown monster and don't leave anyone, even Chacha <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> At that time we mostly used to discuss about his internship <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> where he was frustrated by his employers <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and how he used to watch "De taali" daily <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><br>contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>

Before anything, I must say , <b>No one in our batch is well prepared for placements than him</b> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . It seemed like he had gone through whole of wiki,placement sites etc. not only he read things, he implemented most of them <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. During placement preparation , when we were solving algo question, he was "yeh toh ho jaayega", "yeh mein log(n) mein kar doonga etc..". When D-Day came, first day when no one was selected, then also he noticed that his written script was not neat than those who cleared written, he improved that and next day when he cleared his written. I was damn sure he will clear the interview round. and he did that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . HIs support after his placement is very needed that time and he not went home and stayed here for us <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />.Even while my interview was going on, he and PK keep encouraging me for next coming round. and chill me with a joke on HR <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ThankQ guys <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> The 8th sem brought us really close.

Altough kisi mein kuch karna nahin hota <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> still he wakes me for all the classes I intend to attend <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We always have something to discuss while getting bored in class as have common interest of watching sitcoms esp.

He remembers little incidents of that and keep bugging you with "arey jab woh hota hain ", "yaad hain ek baar" etc. Excellent memory hain bande ki.Movies mein Rocky ka die hard fan hain even his gtalk id is rockyrocks <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.He is big fan of old songs, mind you they are not classics but songs like "payalia","aaooaaa","raanaa ji","chandani" and much more <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Keeps singing them while his daydreams <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>	I appreciate him for his truthfulnesss and how he opens up really fast. He always keep telling you his history,crushes ,school friends, how they used to fight, his tuition classes, gym etc.He is very very pessimistic person. Hamesha worst sochta hain aur rota rehta hain <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Another thing about is, he lives like a flow chart., if this then this , else if this then this , else that etc. types ki planning karke chalta hain even for small actions. Has very valid reason for everything he does and is very expressive as in he conveys everything that he is thinking <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He goes on repeating same stuff l.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My neighbour in the classroom, and one guy who's changed a lot over the years. From the first two years, I remember him as a nice chap but someone who always cried about something or the other. Especially acads, which incidentally, he is very good at.

Volleyball, hanging out, BC, daroo...<br><br>In first year, I remember sharing my PC with him and Dandu in the workspace. He was always a guy who was serious about assignments, and we often had to make slots so that we got enough time on the comp <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He was also very sincere when it came to lectures. Kapil, he and me had a lot of discussions on different issues in the classroom though <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . In third year, I recollect Bajaj being in our group for the Middleware assignment, and how he fodufied it and rescued us <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And of course placements.. There were two guys in the batch who were very serious about it right from day 0.. Bajaj and PK.

I mean sometimes I wonder why does anyone need to explain his or her actions so much.. but bajaj makes sure that he's not taken into bad light or wrongly <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>He's been a part of most of our recent outings and BC sessions.. and he certainly brings a lot to all the fun we have <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... <br>The things I like and appreciate about him are his sincerity, truthfulness, fun-loving nature and being clear about most of the things.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><b>remember you for</b> the dedication u showed in the placement season, your knowledge of TV shows, and your being a die hard 'rocky' fan <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><b>advice <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b> you shud be more confident.. and you don't always need to explain ur actions <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Have a successful career n life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kapil aka bajaj aur baju ... the most dedicated person <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I hv seen in college that might be in terms of studies, basketball or some other stuff <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>He is the best basketball player of our batch and one of the best in volleyball also.<br><br>I talked for the first time when he shifted to NBH cellar ... before that I hv noticed him rearly, I thought of him as a geeky and secretive kind as I have never seen him coming out of his room and having fun or doing any kind of BC. But after coming to NBH most of the prejudiced things changed <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is really good at BC also and of very friendly nature. After that our friendship strengthed when we did summer intership together and now I can say I know him really well <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>In summers we use to go to the office (for internship) together and those are the most unforgettable day with u <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Jeetu use to come along us and we use to have a lot of fun (saying Lucky day <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). We spent whole time while going to Kothaguda sharing our views about different things and persons and also sharing our stories of school time or college that we both have hardly shared with anyone.<br><br>He is a trustworthy person and never hurts anyone thats the best thing I like about him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He can adjust with any kind of person. He was one of the Cachein team members and we had a lot of fun and an unforgetable experience. He was very efficient in making the backend as we did the whole work in a day or two. He had a lot of fun while answering the queries of people.<br><br>He is very supportive and enthusiastic also, he was with us on Vaishno Devi Trip and it was a gr8 pleasure to have him with us <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br><br>In the end, i can say that I m really Lucky to have u as my friend <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Best of Luck for your future. Always be as you are .. it always feels good to be in ur company. We both are in Hyderabad so please always be in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>KBC, is nam ke liye ye hamesha mujhe galiyan deta rahega. Filhal ye hamare batch ke most eligible bachelors main se ek hai. I'm a big fan of his dance which he did in our fresher's party. Worksapce main nfs ke session, iske room pe juniors ki raging, kuch khas movies ke dialogues jo ise yad ho gaye the <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> JV ke sessions jinhe jhelne main hamne kafi madad ki hai ek doosre ki. JV ka ekmatra fayda jo mujhe mila hai wo yahi ki kapil se dosti ho gayi thi. Or haan Vayu ki basketball ki team jo kapil ke bina adhoori rahati hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> par ye bas practice main hi basket karta hai. In GHEB he was known for his updates. Log isse poochte the ki kuch naya aya hai kya DC par. He helped me a lot during the placements. Bande ne 2 din main poori OS pada di thi mujhe <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Or bhi na jane aise kitni batain hai jo bhooli nahi ja sakti ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>part1: <br><br>Bajaj mera padosi ... He's a person who I always admire and always been jealous of him because of his dedication and hard work. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Ragging session with him was awesome... gaali session ..sabhi cheap galiya di thi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. <br><br>How can I forget those BC session with you in my room. You'll have always fun while talking to him, because if he didn't find anyone to make fun of, he'll make fun of himself. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He's captain of batch BB team. I've learn game from him and he has given me enthusiasm to come everyday to play from GHEB. We both used to go and have played many times one on one game. A good sport person and while playing BB with him is fun a lot except sometime when he gets angry <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>He's a great competitor. He sees life as a competition and want to do better than other always. He knows that he can do better than others for that he just require the hard work. He's one of the most hard working person in IIIT. <br><br>He's dedication in Gym always inspired me. He has good physic.  <br><br>He's the person who takes life seriously and work to improve future in his limitation.<br> <br>Continue...</b></i></ul><br><br>
