He had changed a lot after parting as Sainani's roommate i think. He seems to be a more composed individual with lesser levels of frustration and anger.<br><br>All the best for your future.

<b>For <a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hmm Pankaj is a person who is very difficult to describe. The person to be blamed here is none other than God himself for making such a unique cocktail of unprecedented talents. He is definitely a man of the fine arts. His bold strokes fill those caricatures with life. He is a very good singer also. He has a very unique stage presence which is full of enigma,style and defiance. His performance in fel 2k6 deserved more than accolades or prizes. But i must admit that he has gone into a shell over the past 2 years which is not good.<br><br>The only advice i can give you is that you are like an eclipsed sun currently. Use some of your theatrical energy in real life to build broader networks. Vibrate your inner molecules of passion consistently as you must know this <i> Its not that your chasing the limelight, its the limelight which actually needs and deserves a person like you</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
