<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This little, extremely gentle, soft spoken guy has sat behind me in sooo many courses. We almost did our entire BTech sitting together. I don't know why we never really got to know each other very well personally. <br><br>But one thing is for sure, Srinivas. I owe atleast some part of my miniscule CGPA to you. And I'll always, always remember you for that. <br><br>Writing your testimonial makes this whole exercise of writing testimonials look very complete and meaningful to me. All the exams that we wrote in IIIT, all the courses we sat and slept through together are are flashing before my eyes as I write this. <br><br>I had always wanted to say all this, but could never get myself to it. Thanks for being there for me on so many occasions. I hope I can do something for you some day. And I know that that would be a worthier occasion.<br><br><b>Will remember you for:</b> The major part of our BTech that we sat together.<br><b>Message for you:/b> Keep Smiling <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=erreddy.html>Raghavendar Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>We call him the godfather of our gang.He is one of the only few guys in IIIT who is regular to all the classes. <br>The major part of my CGPA is becoz of dis guy.His teaching skills are awesome .Without him i would not have passed a single course.He is very stubborn and very deep rooted to his values.The jokes he cracks are really mind "blowing" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .Watching each and evry telugu  movie<br>downloaded without even forwarding is  an indication of how much patience he has <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .He is the best trouble shooter you can have on your side.Being my wingie for the past four years whenever i have trouble  i just yell "srinu" and he will apparate before me for my rescue.He is a hardcore gamer but only play against bots.We will be mesmerized by some the loop holes he found out in games like EA cricket and FIFA <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .In my book of four years of IIIT he will be in every page of it.<br><br><b>GODFATHER srinu aka anjaneya ZINDABAD!!!</b></b></i></ul><br><br>
