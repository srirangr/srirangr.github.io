<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>His designs have impressed anyone and everyone who have had the chance to have a look at them. His posters for lit. events were the best I've ever seen. So was the t-shirt design with such a nice design and a great theme!<br>He's quite modest and I've had good time interacting with him. He's a patient fellow and has tolerated me when I've bombarded him with questions on some occasions.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>BhargavA - one of the friends Felicity 09 has given me. Thanks to Usability and Crop Production classes we became pretty close friends <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I tease to my heart's content but not once did he retort back or get serious. His answer has always been an ear to ear broad smile. He is a very sweet guy and it is always great fun to hang out with him. He is am ardent user of the gAlwaysidle <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I admire this lad for his awesome creativity <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  as if you guys didn't already know about it. Felicity video, Samvedana logo, our batch T-shirt, etc, etc, etc, speak it all for him <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He also has a very smart dressing sense - something "many" people adore him for <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And yes... more than his dressing sense there is something much better about him and that is his VOICE - a very deep and awestrikingly impressive voice. You would never think that a chap with such a lean physique can have such a great voice <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>    I am really glad that we became friends BhargavA. I wish all the very best for everything you take up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met him in 6th semester when we signed up a contract with IIIT to make a new website.

It goes something like - "Hey I am bhargova, I like to eat a guava, I also like yuktahaar ka poha.." Yes, I know it is soo soo lame but I had to write it somewhere before we all forget it. This song, my dear folks is the source of inspiration for DJ Ranga to make a frigging awesome rap on bee.<br><br>   Looking at how great friends we are, my belief that you dont actually have to spend eons to know how good a person is or how well you can gel with a person has changed. Wishing you all the very best for your future plans and I sincerely wish you make every dream of yours true.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>       There was this mail sometime in 2nd year as to who those interested in being a part of the video team for Felicity'08 should come off to some X room in the mainbuilding. I was there. When Karan started talking, there came up one voice talking about the technicalities of making a video and I thought - "hmm..this guy knows a lot of stuff about making videos, never saw  or heard of him before.. Then I remembered where I have seen him - ofcourse, how can I forget the b-e-a-u-ttttiful dance of yours in first year where we all showered praises for your superb robot dance <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Kidding. You are a great dancer!<br>    Then for the video making, we had these regular meetings and then I think it was through Sashi and Tifozi that we became such great friends that we are right now. It is total fun having him around - he is silent, he does not retort back at my innumerable meaningless absolutely crajjjy comments <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. what more do you want! But these days, he has become quite smart and I will have to sharpen my <i>leofying</i> skills to face you. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br>    Few words about Bee, mind you, only few - He has got a amazingly creative mind <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and an equally sweet heart.. He is level-headed, thoroughly understanding, a great listener and not just he listens to you, he advices you when he thinks there is a wrong from your end.<br>        He dreams big, works towards his dreams so tirelessly that he is one of the source of inspiration for me. He makes me believe that if you dream for achieving something, then you have to give your 100% to it and not leave it as just another dream! I honestly don't think I would have had the guts to start off something as big as Samvedana if I would not have been friends with Bee and Sharat <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Whats more than having people whom you so greatly admire and respect as your closest friends who can thoroughly help you work towards your dream all throughtout? <br>    </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bharghav a.k.a Bee a.k.a Bakki a.k.a Bhargova the Casanova<br><br>Friends right from Day 1. Very calm, used to listen to every class and make regular notes. I really dont know how he could bare us (me,prudhvi and sharat - a total PIA trio) at his back constantly discussing some arbit topic. We share a common set of friends (apart from the IIIT friends) and that's how our discussions used to begin the first year days. It was in first year, and everyone was given html assignments. His was one of the best designs that I had come across (though it had pink color <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and he has lived upto that expectation even today. First year days was total fun - with me, bharghav, ramreddy and goutham talking some arbit crap, watching DBZ (I never liked it).<br><br>He has worked really hard to reach what he is today - undoubtedly the best designer in college. He is one of those guys who loves working on out of the box ideas. I was annoyed at him once (Felicity Tee Design) but I respect for what you had done at that point of time.<br><br>Wishing you loads of luck and hope you come out with flying colors <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Gentleman Bhargava <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> One can almost picture GAG shouting it along the corridors <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Can it get more apt?<br><br>In the initial days of Felicity '08, our mood and optimism about the fest would often depend on Bhargava's mood. Yes, he was <i>that</i> crucial to the working of he fest. Right from the start till the very end, he was there as a major figure. A lot of our discussions would take place in his room.<br><br>Everyone knows that hes the best designer around. Everyone knows that the way he handled the Felicity video was brilliant. Everyone knows that he came up with some super fodu designs for the posters and the website. Every time we needed something to be designed, Bhargava was there. This put a lot of extra burden on him, but he took on the responsibilities <i>most</i> of the times. Of course, it was natural that with such burden, there were times he would get irritated. But he took it all with his typical smile. And did a super job of the video!<br><br>In more ways than one, I think Felicity '08 changed him! He was no more shy, could see how it was working under so much pressure and expectations. While pushing you, sorry if I ever crossed my brief, mate! All in good intentions <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I have often told Chand that both of you would be perfect partners for opening an animation company together <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best mate, am sure you'll keep those artistic instincts alive apart from doing your thing!<br><br><b>Person you resemble: You seem to be Sharat's alter ego <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Fav memory: Video release, and your smile after that.<br>Message for him: The usual, be more outgoing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Bhargava aka Renderkid</u><br><br><b>The quintessential gentleman, the creative guy, the whiz kid, the geeky guy </b>.... I could go on listing the adjectives which could describe him and the list would almost never end. Its been such a pleasure knowing this gentleman always calm, composed and serene. You can do nothing but wonder at the designs he keeps churning out with such regularity, I mean there should be some limits to the creative side of a person and yet this guy seems to defy all those limits and keeps coming up with more and more stuff. His contribution to our batch in unparalleled, all those poster designs during Felicity, one of the most memorable posters of Felicity, the first one to have come out was designed by none other than him and ofcourse the awesome batch tee he designed which got praises from all and sundry who saw it.<br><br>I can't claim to have known him very much as our interactions have been quite limited but whatever I know of him, He seems to be an artist in true sense, who couldnt care less about the world, if its his art which lies on the other side.<br><br>He always gives an impression of being a master of any situation which might arise, nothing seems to perturb him, he would just keep going on calmly and with an assurance in whatever he intends to do.<br><br>Here's wishing you all the luck in all your future endeavours. Hoping to see <b>Renderkid</b> a leading light in the field of designing a few years down the line.<br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Whatever I've seen of him, he fulfils every attribute of being an artist.<br><br>An artist lives by the spark in his heart, and goes whichever way it leads him to, at whatever time it breaks in. That's quite alright, but sometimes you're already commited to moving along a certain flow, and in the general case, the timing and direction of the flow would not be in harmony with the direction your spark would have you go toward. What's more, the mundane flow sometimes dampens the sparks and this causes you to sometimes wish you could just chuck it all.<br><br>It'll be quite interesting to see Bhargava when he'll have a vast, quiet ocean to paint on, and won't have to worry about muscling this way and that in a flow clearly not meant for him.</b></i></ul><br><br>

There's no Adobe product that this guy doesn't know.<br><br><br>There's a mystery in him which I'll never understand. When he first went out on a date, he came to my room and told me (and only me and no one else from our gang) the entire story. And again he chose me to put all of his money in bank A/c. I still don;t know what was the reason behind that. Even today he tells me (and only me) some of the incidents. Is it because I give all nice romantic ideas? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> Or is it because I'm a very matured guy who can understand your feelings? or is it because I respect privacy? Whatever the case may be thanks for your trust in me dude. Very few people tell me all the things close to their heart and that makes me feel proud of myself. You are one of them. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br><br>After coming to fourth year, I became very lazy but he used to wake me up daily for breakfast. Even today he wakes me up and that's how my day starts. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><br>Its very easy to leofy him. He rarely gets angry. So we keep pulling his leg everytime. If there's no one around, he comes into the spotlight and he never feels bad, howmuchever we leofy him. He's got many nick names. Loverboy, Plastic boy <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, renderchicha, the Dude, Adobe kaka, brand boy, sexy boy, Gova, spikes kid, etc etc. Also these days he's learning to speak fluent Hindi, which is not possible as long as you are close to us(the Hyderabadi Hindi speaking gang) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And I simply love the way he says "kyabbe salley" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Also he's got a biiiiiig fan following in GH. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I wrote a rap on him which completely describes him but still, I'd like to share some of the Awesome moments I shared with this guy. I rarely knew him in the first two years. We hardly spoke to each other. Only one thing I knew about him back then was that he's just the same as my roomie(Sharbat <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and they were both travelling in the same boat. <br><br><br>It was the summer of 2007, when he was all active with his interests of making posters and videos for Felicity. That was the time when we actually spoke to each other. Then I came to know that he's a very creative guy. Very much interested in what he's doing leave alone acads. And then we spoke a lot about different things. A very dedicated Movie/ TV Show viewer. He watches around 20 TV Shows parallely. Ask him about any show and he'll give the update. Such is the case with movies too. Gives awesome movie reviews. If Bhargava says some movie is not good, I won't even care to download it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><br>We share many interests, like movie directing, acting, making videos/spoofs, listening to music etc etc. But I never dedicated time towards my interests. We make a great director/screenplay-writer duo together with all my filmy knowledge and his advanced technological skills. He was the one who thought of creating a spoof of 'Heroes' and we pooled in all the ideas of how to make it but we rather ended up giving our project a new name "The Minus-H Crowd". Whenever we were together our ideas would make everyone around laugh. Mama What about Rowdies 5.oh! and the Ranga video! <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>A few months back I would have used the words super creative, fab designer or astonishingly calm to describe him but now that I know him pretty well (at least I think I do) I would still use the same words <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Jokes apart, I really enjoy his company because he lets me go on these talkathons and listens to all the crap I say with a lot of patience. Probably the smartest,coolest and most intriguing guy I have met .. I genuinely wish I had got to know him better earlier <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>      We initially bonded over tv shows,movies,music etc and the best part is he one of the very few people who follow OTH (which btw is the bestest tv show ever). Has a very unique taste in music and movies. Trustworthy and understanding, its been great fun being around him and he is an incredibly mature guy. He is extremely talented <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and good at what he does and am sure will achieve immense success in whatever he chooses to do in the future. Will always look back on our walks and chats with a lot of fondness and one thing that will always make me smile is how unintentionally nerdy he can get at times <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . Had a lot of fun during the salsa workshop and the Dj nite during Felicity, and dude why we dont win a tv show quiz beats me!!! The strangest thing is ever since he started following a bit of football, Liverpool<br>have been doing exceptionally well!!! Points of contention : he likes Nadal and hates Kareena. Have been trying to change his opinion for some time now but have failed.I aint giving up tho ! <br><img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>There are lots of other things I respect and admire him for but he knows all that .Your an awesome friend and just overall an awesome guy. Wishing you all the luck for your future and tons of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bhargav the style icon of IIIT. If I were not placed I thought of opening a showroom "Bhargav's  collection". He is a very good designer, hard working and always tries to break my counters. He is a silent killer. His creativity and work nature is very good. I wish both of them go well in the future.  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>There are few aspects of anyone's life which I segregate as social life, individual life. Individual life can further be divided as philosophical instinct and survival instinct.<br><br>Now, the one line I write for this fellow as the major part of testimonial is - He's the person in whom I can almost find a reflection of mine, in individual life's survival instinct part.<br><br>And regarding other things...<br><br>He rocks as a designer. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Western Music freak, I got lot of my collection(non-telugu, of course <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) from his.<br><br>Rational thinker. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Looks innocent.(2005 census, outdated) <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>Sensitive. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>Lazy and dull at eating -- reflects his BMI. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Hard worker - I'm saying this from depth of my heart, not just a token of appreciation! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I can see a (present & future) Indian world class designer in him, hope to see more delicious works pop from his creative head, Good luck Da!</b></i></ul><br><br>
