<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My first impressions of him was that of a funny guy. He came to GHEB one day and we were talking about people who got "healthy interaction" with seniors and later Atul and I started talking about ghost stories and movies like Raaz.<br>Subroto, unexpectedly decided to sleep in our room because he said he was too afraid to go back. Luckily I had an extra bedding with me. I too fear ghosts, so I can understand how it must have felt, but his situation was quite hilarious, we were asking him to leave and he wasn't leaving! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Since the day we got our marks of ITWS I mid sem 1 and I got highest marks, he pesters me<br>whenever he gets a chance by telling his twisted version of the story to others with delight and satisfaction. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>He reminds me of some funny Bengali character of some funny hindi TV serial, forgot the character. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>His company is always pleasant, lightens up the moment. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Subroto - One of the most <b>Frustoo</b> guy in our batch.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He has crush on almost every girl in IIIT-H.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> And he also keep their pics in his PC. I don't know how he gathers so many pics of them. Not only he keeps their pics but also try to compare them with some Bollywood/Hollywood heroine.<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> According to him, one girl in our batch looks like Mallika Sherawat. I suppose she also knows about that. <br>Inspite of all that, he is a very good guy at heart.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> His friends can always find him ready for help. He is a cheerful guy who wants his ambiance to be cheerful too.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a great student and also good at some sports(viz. Cricket) and computer games(viz. Pocket Tanks). In ECE batch, he is among the top 5 students.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I still don't know how he maintains his position among such brilliant batch mates. And that's why he has been an inspirational source for me.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>In spite of being a good athlete, he is very slow at walking.<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> I can bet that his grandmother(if alive) could also walk faster than him.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>We both are very good friends right from the very first year of our college life. That time, he used to teach me a few courses as we had same courses in the first year. In that year, he used to tease me with some cheap word and due to that, I took him to Prof. Mitra where Prof. Mitra told him not to repeat that word again.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> He became upset from me due to that <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but, as I told you, he is very good at heart, he forgave me. And our habit of eating Maggi late night strengthened our friendship. We both participated together in Kahani Mein Twist. But only once, we were able to secure First position in it.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Now, I can't pass a single day without meeting him.<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I everyday visit his room. I don't know how am I going to pass the very next year without him .<br>I will miss you a lot,buddy.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Hope you achieve whatever you desire in your life. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>CHEERS!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>As Subroto already mentioned, we were among the first ones to interact with each other in NBH. I'd remember him as Vibhav's good friend, and Chika/Pagare's neighbour.<br><br>Everyone knows that Subroto is fodu when it comes to acads. He has generally done well, and got placed in a good company <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He prepared well for CAT, and I'm sure you'll crack it the next time around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The other noticable thing about him is the frankness and openness. Don't think he'll bitch behind you, he's likely to tell it to you on your face. And yeah, the smile on his face - hes always the funny guy around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We've had our differences, but I guess that happens. Do well in life.

<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Subroto Sen a.k.a Pinky Sen a.k.a BTP Partner a.k.a Subbo a.k.a Frusto<br><br>He speaks his heart and is always crystal clear. He is self composed and relaxed all the time. Never seen him lose temper expect for a couple of times. If he really likes something he works his a** off to achieve/understand it. Worked very sincerly for CAT and even helped me out at times. I had great fun working with him especially the BTP project. Instead of going for an internship in summer we decided to stay back at IIIT Hyderabad and continue with our BTP work. We had done an extensive research work on "chickipedia.com" - a wiki about women apart from the BTP, got people involved in estimating figures and had mastered at the art of figure estimation. The fun I had with his Orkut/Gmail account was totally awesome (Made him join Bengali Aunties Community in Orkut, abrupt messages like "Hi .. I got placed .. ok bye" sent to the girls in his friends list, etc). The only problem that I faced with him was his laziness but he is working on it. A total food freak and has got all the traits of a typical Bengali Guy. <br><br>Wishing you great success at Samsung. Bhallo!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>For as long as I remember,</b> I've always called this guy a tharki and made fun of him and his 'exploits' with girls. I must have crossed some border at some point of time or the other but he never flinched. In fact I've never seen him make fun of people by 'downsizing' them, but always by upscaling them. Hats off to this sporting spirit, bro. Not many people can go on like this. <br><br>He seems quite careful about his career goals and is quite candid and forthright about them. Has also walked the talk - he's one of the good ECE students of our batch. I've had most of my interactions with him in the Yuktahaar mess. We've together been a part of a number of debates and discussions in Yuktahaar in the fourth year, most notably during the placement season, when we had some of the best BC of the college life. One particular thing I like about him is that he often waits for people while they finish their meals - something which not many people do for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>I've always seen him making others laugh,</b> many times at his own expense. Hope you continue this way. <br>All the best for future life. Samsung mein phod dena.

<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Subroto aka Subbo aka Subbz hamare group balki hamare batch ka sabse bada frustoo hai. Aaj tak shayad hi koi ladki hogi  jo ise pasand nahin aayi hogi, jo  bhi ladki dikh jaye woh <b>sexy</b> hoti hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Vaise ladkon mein bhi ise khaas interest hai, lekin main iske baare mein zyada detail mein baat nahin karoonga <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Iski sabse achchhi baat yeh hai ki yeh bahut hi frank hai, sabse mast tareeke se baat karta hai aur har tarah ki baat karta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Iske favourite topics hai ladkiyaan aur stuff. Inka database kaafi solid hai aur hamesha updated rahta hai. Koi information chahiye ho to Subbo ke paas se mil jaati hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Yeh hamare group ka woh banda hai jo most of the times sabka shikaar banta hai. Mauka kuchh bhi ho agar Subbo aas paas hai to Subbo ki li jaani hi hoti hai. Lekin yeh kabhi iska bura nahin maanta, yeh baat mujhe iski kaafi pasand hai. Last mein aakar iska bolna ki <b>ab main kuchh nahin boloonga</b> mujhe hamesha yaad rahega <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Banda hamare ECE batch mein 2nd rank holder hai. Lekin yeh baat aaj tak kisi ko samajh mein nahin aayi ki agar ise subject samajh mein nahin aata to yeh A ya A- lekar kaise aa jata hai. Hamara best guess hai, prof. aur TA ke saath iske <i>achchhe</i> relations <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Lekin yeh bahut hi helpful hai. Ek baar Bharatiye ko pass karvane ke liye isne LA ke final paper se ek din pahle poori raat jaag kar use shuru se lekar end tak saari LA padhayi thi.<br><br>Agar Khurana ise koi challenge de de to iski satak jaati hai. Us case mein kuchh bhi ho jaye ise challenge poora karna hi hota hai.<br><br>Vaise to ise gussa nahin aata hai, lekin agar aa jaye to kabhi bhi aur kisi bhi baat par aa sakta hai. Ek baar iski mujhse ladayi bhi ho chuki hai. Lekin phir bhi hamari aadhe ghante ke andar-andar vapis se baat honi shuru ho gayi thi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>GK iski itni badhiya hai ki ise aaj tak samajh mein nahin aaya ki Chandigarh UT hai, city hai, state hai ki capital hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.

<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He never takes too much tension. (Almost) Everything is "lite theeko anna" for him. Iske room masti center hai hamare group la. Kuch na kuch pakta hi rahta hai. Jane kaun kaun se log room par aate hain iske. First year, second year, third year sab aate hain. 2-2 ghanta baith kar bhi jate hain. <br>Iski kuch cheezain meri aaj tak samajh main nahin aayin. Yeh kabhi ghoomne kyon nahin jata? Yeh kabhi apne sentiments show kyon nahin karta? Haan yeh bahut cool hai par ise bhi acha bura agta hai. Par ye kabhi batayega nahin. Iske dimag main kya chal raha hai kisi bhi cheez ko lekar? Har cheez ko hansi main taal deta hai.<br>First year ke baad kafi time hum logon ne sath main bitaya hai. He is very helping.
