"<br><br>These are the lines from one of Kishore's songs which also tops my fav oldies list. Whenever I see Paro, I am reminded of this song.<br><br>Well, I seldom had any interaction with this guy in these 4 years but one thing is for sure, his instantaneous jiokes and creativity is something appreciable <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. One of his most importnat qualities is that he's sensible enough to spread gandagi at right places <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and doeen;t make chaos.<br><br>Paro bhai tum rocking ho aur aise hi SRK style me rockng karte hue sabke dil jeet-te rehna ...<br><br>All the best for your future buddy<br><br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>I know him from the days when his hair were as long as 30 cms. Well today his hair size is just a few mms. Anyways, here I'm talking about Kranthi. One of the best batsmen IIIT has ever seen. I still remmeber how he hit 5 sixes in Vijay Bharat's over, when we were playing in the Felicity ground during 3rd year holidays. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. It almost reminded me of Yuvvi.<br><br>Our first acquaintance was the Agni Freshers meet 2k5. He was also my co-dancer in Kajra Re. One helluva performance that was!!<br><br>Just like me, he;s also a big fan of medtitaion and Vivekananda. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Also, he's a Kasi Ko... He also maintains a kirana shop in his room. Whatever I need, any household stuff, like knife, cooker I simply go to his room. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>This guy can tach anyone anywhere. I just love his sarcasm and the way he talks to Gopal in the mess. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Will all those mess sessions with you and Gopal man!! <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>His hair style is "ekdum hatke". Sometimes like Dhoni sometimes spiky and as of today an almost bald head <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>All in all Kranthi is an awesome person to know. All the very best for your (asap) MS and for your future. Be in touch. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Keep rocking. Sky is no limit for all the racha that u do. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=srpchaitanya.html>Phani Chaitanya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>SRP stands for "Super rocking personality" is all I can say <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. LTRC bondz. Keep rocking.<br><br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vsatish.html>Satish Varagani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Satish is a very nice guy. Very down to earth and a nice person to speak to. <br><br>He was my brother's classmate during LT. At that time, I just knew him by face, but we actually started talking to each other after cming to IIIT. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a very soft spoken person and a great guy at heart. <br><br>Keep rocking ra satti mama ..<br><br>All the very best for your future.<br><br>Srirang <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dgkreddy.html>D Girish Kumar Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He's the weirdest guy I've ever seen in my life. His hair style, his way of walking, talking (do u remember .. "Anna vangite mass .. den**te mass" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> on 14th Feb 2008 <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), behaviuor. From behaviour I remember that this guy has a very intriguing character. I mean I've never seen anyone sitting on the one side of the table ONLY for dinner/lunch. Its very difficult to describe him (assuming that I know at least 1% of him) in 2048 characters here.<br><br>But this guy is intelligent to the core. He can do whatever he wants to do. I still remember. We were sitting in the first class in TIME institute and the lecturer asked everyone why they wanted to do an MBA. His reply was "I don't know". The lecturer was all shocked. But he gave the same answer again . I can still never understand whether that was his psychoism or innocence, but in either case, he is a Weirdo. But I like him for whatever he is. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>His tutorials on Globalization had helped me a lot to understand the course as well as to get passed. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I don't know how but this guy, unlike me, has a great image in Ramu's eyes. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future ra. Come on raa <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Keep rocking.<br><br>Yours<br>DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Well .. All I know is that AK stands for " Ati Kasi " and he;s a very nice person to talk to. Gymboy. And very very very punctual/disciplined guy.  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I liked to tease you "AK loves you" on Felicity 09 3rd day. It was a nice memory. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future macha. Keep rocking.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Raman aka RJ.<br><br>Isko to main first 2 years me sirf naam se jaanta tha. 3rd year me jab hum OBH me saath me aaye tab hi se ise bahut achi tarah se jaanne laga hun.<br><br>First of all I'm very sorry yaar, maine tere saath kai baaar misbehave kiya. But kya karun koi mujhe peeche se maare mujhe bilkul acha nahi lagta. Fir chahe wo mazak se ho ya jaise bhi.<br><br>ok. coming to the point. This guy is one of my best friends in IIIT. Ups and downs are quite common in life but I like his attitude towards life. Enjoy bhi karo, kaam bhi karo aur hamesha haste raho. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The first word that comes to my mind whenever I see him is "Bindaas!!!"<br><br>Awesome!!<br><br>Felicity 3rd day ye mere saath baith kar bahut roya. Itna ki matlab mujhe bhi rula diya almost. Woh main kabhi nahi bhula sakta. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Iske baare me mujhe bahut jyada to kuch pata nahi tha. But Junior treat me pol khul gayi aur main to iska bahut bada fan ho gaya. Matlab banda kuch bhi karne se oehle jyaada sochta nahi hai ki anjaam kya hoga! Wah kya attitude hai!  Ekdum "Bindass!!" wala.<br><br>Chalo abhi time ke constraint ki wajah se main aur jyada nahi likh paounga. But chance mila to is testimonial ko thoda sa aur extend zaroor karunga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Keep rocking buddy. I know that you've a great future and that you're going to go places. And my best wishes are always with you.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

But actually, he's a very hard working guy and was a great coordinator. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>He's also the best in pulling others' legs. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Well complete your MS asap and all the very best 4 ur future. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Keep rocking<br><br>Love.<br>Srirang <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Aniket aka Tullu Sharma aka mastram.<br><br>I met this guy during our first Agni meet. He was very enthusiastic about the skit and dance and songs and all. But in the end we ended up doing the most cliched skit of Sholay. Aur usme bhi gadbad kar dii. But that was a sweet memory that I'll carry with me forever.<br><br>He's a nice singer and sings with all his emotions in his voice. Well I like that man. You completely see yourself in the position of the protagonist while singing and get completely involved. Awesome!!<br><br>Well, coming to the more important points. He's also very active in sports and is a great athlete. I never took part in any of the sports activities in general, but I used to go out with him for jogging and then I came to know that he's such a great adventure freak. He can go to any extent as long as something is adventurous. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He was once a very heavy drinker and had shared his drink with guys from almost everybatch that we've seen in IIIT.<br><br>A big BCbaaz. Kisi bhi cheez par BC kar sakta hai. Kisi bhi arbit cheez par. Bahut achi achi kavitayien bhi likhta hain. Ekdum dil se. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But sabse main to iska blog writing style hai.<br><br>Dude, your analysis of Ug2k5 as a batch in the post was something unforgettable. It was the best post I've ever ever read in my life and 65+ comments on that post is a testimony for that fact. The Samvedna and scribe wala post bhi awesome tha. Without my knowledge I felt that suddenly a teardrop was rolling in the corner of my eye. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your blogging talent man! Seriously!!<br><br>Aise he awesome kaam karte rehna. Aise hi adventures karte rehna. Mujhe kabhi na bhulana.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Humne milkar khoob masti kii. Pata nahi kyun ek din achanak main iske room par aake tapka, aur tab ye koi acha sa song chala raha tha. Jo ki mere database me nahi tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. To usse pooch kar maine uska "My Fav" folder collection utha liya. Kya ultimate folder tha. OMG!! Aaj bhi pada hai mere paas. Matlab kind of samajh lo har awesome situtaion ke liye awesome song ho jaise uske collection me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Main to bhai fida ho gaya iska collection dekh kar. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Fir mota bhai ko maine apna English songs ka collection diya jo ki ye apne room par ghaton ke liye bajata rehta tha. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Aur fir hum logon ne game banaya ki song start kar do aur fastest guess karo. Main hamesha jeet-ta tha. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Aapko lag raha hoga ki main itni badi kahani kyun bata raha hun. Right? Ye to sirf itna batane ke liye tha ki "Bas aise hi hamari dosti hui". <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Waise hum aur bhi jyada close to tab aaye jab ye mere room par nashta karne aata tha ( "Bhooka" saala!! )<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> aur mere 1 mahine ka stuff 2 din me khatam karke chala jaata tha <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Aur fir kya tha.

<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sanket Sharma aka Daddu aka CR<br><br>Daddu is like a big brother to me. Sorry bro, maine socha tha ki jo bahut close hain unke saath memories jyada hnge .. so last me likhte hain. But saala ab time hi nahi raha <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>ok So I was saying that Daddu is one of the most versatile guys of our batch. He can speak to any group and anyone. And most importantly, the way he speaks with anyone is so pleasing that "One can't deny the offer that he makes". <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He's my batchmate but I don;t know why, whenever I see him I feel like, he's very matured and disciplined. (maybe coz, I'm not <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). There's a lot of maturity jo ki jhalakti rehti hai bande ko dekh kar. The way he walks, the way he talks and the say he smiles.<br><br>This guy always brings a smile to my face. Jab bhi dekho hasta rehta hai. The most important quality that I've noted in him is that, whatever the sitatuin may be, this guy has the guts to face it and <b>enjoy himself</b> in it. That's a great quality dude. I mean har situation ko enjoy karte hue jeeta hai. And that's one thing I've learnt from him during the Kerala trip<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. And the result was that just one month after the Kerala trip, during our batch trip I became famous as DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Dude, there's a lot of things that can be learnt from you. You are <b>awesome</b><br><br>I still remmeber in 1st year, as a CR, this guy has always helped us in postponing assignments whenever necessary and planning different things. I wish I can go back in time and spend more time with you buddy!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He's the most most optimistic guy I've ever seen in my student life. The most optimistic. He was such a moral support to me during our placement time. And I owe you a treat bro. It was 2nd Jan I I was watching Slumdog .. for 6th time. Then comes Daddu and says "Ranga! Dekh abhi bas 3 din hi bache hain. Uske baad companies ke aane ki frequncy kam ho jayegi. 5th ko Airvana aa rah hai padh le .. jaldi se nikal le. Fir milke aish karte hain"</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>"Rohit".. is such a sweet simple name. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>On the very first day of IIIT, when I stepped out of the auto, I saw a guy who was just like me in proportions and with a chubby face, specatcles and all. That was Rohit.<br><br>Well, we didn;t speak for the first two years. The reasons mailnly behind these being that we were in different sections or in different hostels. But we came quite close during the series of cricket matches in 2nd year Summers. And today, I feel proud to have met Rohit and wished, I'd have known him earlier.<br><br>He's a great bowler, a very very great fielder, a great batsman, basically an allrounder in cricket. He also plays Volleyball quite decently. Also, he's an awesome organizer. I remember that we were the guys who had planned for the batch trip 08, but unfortunately, because of the low response, we had to give up.<br><br><br>Now, some of the qualities that I've noted in this guy. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's got authoritative command over all and has the an awesome power of making people work <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Quite a rare quality. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Dude, I guess you should try MBA. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I can see a great future of yours there. He might not be knowing many languages, but I've never seen a communication gap in his way of communication. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Well, because of the time constraint, I guess, I might have to stop it here. <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.

I met this guy during our Felicity. He used to come to Sashidhar's room and we crakced a lot of puzzles in IIT's contests. And after that we did endless BC for hours and hours. Thats how I came to know about him.<br><br>And the next thing I know about him is that he got an intern @ Google. I visited Google for 3 times <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Food there was just awesome!! If you think you've gained your weight, I must say, it was not your problem. Free food is irresistable <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And then, he asked me to book a room for him in our floor. And in 4th year, this guy became my wingmate. Till, then my lingo was kinda pure. But all of a sudden, I started speaking in  a typically Hyd guy, using yaaron and baigan words every now and then. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. That,s how Maruti is, jahan bhi jayega apna effect chod kar jayega <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Things became very different from the day he stepped into our wing. I never felt like I didn't know linux/wndows well. I always thought that whatever happens to my system, now I have Maruti in my wing so there would be no problem. <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.

We also went out to Spoorthy with Namrata, Spandy and Shrikant. It was an awesome experience. A cut on my finger, my dance, your home (remember FTV incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) etc etc.<br><br>After coming to 4th year, we were in gangsta-gang.

We rarely discussed about CAT papers and all, most of the times our discussions were based on movies and TVShows. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The day I shared stage with him as <b>Amar-Prem</b>  during Felicity 09 was the most unforgettable day of my life.

Here goes my testimonial.<br><br>Prateek chicha, khan bhai, PG are the various nick names I use to call this guy. He's the most ultra/super/extrmely cool guys I've ever seen in my life. According to me the definiton of cool is 'Prateek chicha'. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>A piece of fact. People, I'm not the one who knows the maximum languages or who is exposed to maximum number of different cultures in our college, its Prateek. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <b>This guy knows 5 languages</b>. Dude! Kasa kay? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>In first year, our interactions were limited to the CGPA talks and Orkut account details. This guy was so addicted to orkut that, he used to get almost 150 scraps a day. Also, we prepared a lot for ITWS-2 Regular expressions together + SPIM codes. (Dude, do you even remember all those things that we did in 1st year? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). It was one helluva fun. Wherever this guy is fun followz <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Ok. Coming to 2nd year, our paths became different. He was being tortured in ECE and I enjoyed myslef in CSE. In those days, most of our interactions took place in NBH mess only.<br><br>But after 2nd year, in the summers, we played a lot of cricket and I must say, Prateek is a very good bowler with a perfect idea of line and lenght. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. to be frank, bating li8 mama... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, but again shows kasi on the field. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Also during that time, he was addicted to watching heroes and he always insisted me to watch it, apart from many other shows that we usually watch. But I never watched it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.

Comedy and Sarcasm at its peak. Also, he made me watch HIMYM and today I'm a big fan of the show. That's about me. He watches wide variety of TV shows.<br><br>Daru. He was the first one who taught me how to drink, what to drink, what not to drink, How occasionally to drink etc etc.<br><br>Sports. Once he participated in 4x100 relay and won a bronze medal in it. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. No preparation, no practise. Direct hit. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Food. He brings awesome food from home. He has a great sense of Subs. It was him because of whom I started loving Subs. Otherwise I hated it.<br><br>This guy can crack any faaltu puzzle. This awesome talent of him was discovered on the day of Cache In '09.

I'm not telling them to you here publically. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 3 </b><br><br>Linux. This guy is a linux kingu. He was always with me to help me learn any-fuckin-thing in linux and he never made me feel like I dunno any stuff about linux. Today, I'm quite comfortable using linux, but in the beginning it was very difficult. I didn't even know how to configure net and this guy has helped me a lot in many ways to make me feel comfortable using linux. Whoa! And today, I feel like linux is far far far better than the buggy windows. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>English. He speaks awesome English and is an expert in making use of idioms and phrases at the right moment. He has all the GRE words stored in a repository in his mind and quite oftenly he uses some of those words. Also, he writes awesome blog posts and poems. The way with which he manipulates the words brings a smile on everyone's face. Also, I was the main character in his English Literature story <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Movies. He watches many different types of movies and suggests me if any of them are good. Since we are talking about movies, I must say, we have a special relation when it comes to movies. Till today, whatever movie that we saw on my PC was awesome. Wait, lemme makea a complete list of the AWESOMEST movies that we saw together. 123 tops the list, Race, <i>Saawariya</i> ( <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ), Om Shanti Om, Flavours, Apna Sapna Money money, Vivah ( <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> again ), The Kite Runner, Shawshank Redemption, KungFu Panda, CC2C ( <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ), Gulaal, and many more. A complete movie freak.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>Now comes the music part. You won;t believe but I've never heard a single English song before coming to the college and by the end of 4 years I gave a performance on the most difficult song "Lose Yourself!!". I owe a veryyyyyyyy biiiiiiiiiig party to him for this. He was the first one to introduce me to rock. In the beginning, I never liked rock. But when I saw him singing the song with music in background, I too started reading the lyrics and today I know the lyrics of almost 500 English songs. But still on any arbit day, he'd come to my room and download an arbit song, which I've never heard of. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I dunno how come you manage to remember so many songs man! Today, whatever English songs that I have on my PC are by the courtesy of him and Siddu.<br><br>GK. This guy is a big time fodu in GK and quizzes. He never misses any quizzes. Very enthusiastic to conduct quizzes in the campus. Infact, he was also the Literary club coordinator and I got a credit from it. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Again, I must say he;s the chalta firta wikipedia. Be it current affairs or history or business or entertainment world (hollywood/bollywood) or gossip or for that matter p*rn stars too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, he remembers everything. Every goddamn thing about every goddamn guy/incident. And hence, he's got a big data to start a BC. He's a big BC baaz.<br><br>My next point is gonna be "Presentations". He makes the best presentations in IIIT. I've seen people asking him for the background image that he uses for presentations. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. I've learnt a lot about making nice presentations being with this guy. I startef using awesome quote lines and nice images and animation  in my prezo.</b></i></ul><br><br>

I know you wouldn't be expecting a testimonial from me at this last moment. But I couldn;t resist myself from writing one for you.<br><br>Sashi is hardworking, highly highly intelligent, enthusiastic, kiddish at times, ambitious, bada dilwala bhi hai. <br><br>Only people those who are close to him know that he craks awesome jokes. In fact, those jokes are sometimes so awesome that you literally do this => <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He used to crack such awesome jokes when we were in GHEB. Dunno what is the hub of all such jokes, but they are simblly Aahsome!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. These days because of the work load and all, he is not able to crack such awesome jokes. But still sometimes he craks such jokes once in a while.<br><br>I must thank him for showering on me the gyaan about books/novels. I never read any books till 2nd year. And then he comes to me and tells me about Harry Potter books. His way of narrating the story is also awesome. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Actually that was the reason for me to start reading the books. I started with Harry Potter/fantasy and today I read books of a wide variety of genres. But even today, my knowledge is negligible when compared to the living library <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I still read books suggested by him.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Seniors asked us to perform a scene from Adi. I was the producer of that, Rama Reddy was NTR and this guy was a fellow who was supposed to day "Chinna! Toda kottu chinna". We did that scene for 17 times. And that was the time that I came to know that this guy had the simplest name in this world "Raju".<br><br>But I never saw him again. The next time I saw his name was on the email that he sent to the batch mailing list (that time we were in 2nd year) regarding SnS. The email came by the name "Samanthapudi". I was not sure who this guy was. I thought "Oh! He might be the TA of this course" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But later I came to know that it was our Raju.<br><br>After coming to 3rd year, everybody became so dependent on this guy coz he was the TA of DC. And to be frank, he was an awesome TA. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Always helping us in assignments and providing us with the previous year Q papers and all. But becoz of too many students, I got a bad grade and I'm ready to take all the blame on myself because of your selfless nature.<br><br>Then comes 4th year. Raju becomes the Hero. That's it!! We start dobbifying him with that girls name. We shouted to such an extent that even that girl might have known about this dobbifying session of Raju. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But Freshers' 08 was fun man! Awesome fun!<br><br>There are many things for which I'll have to remember you. And I promise I will.<br><br>Keep rocking buddy, you've got an awesome future.

He looks like the villain in terminator when he shaves his head off. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Very hardworking, intelligent. And so innocent that he believes in everything that anybody tells him. He used to talk a lot in the first 2 years. But these days, he rarely speaks.

Actually, he never uses slang and you can pull his leg for hours and hours and hours. The discussions in mess were always about his shirt or hair style. Oh! Now that I've come to his hairstyle point, lemme tell you about some(I can't explain all qualities here <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) of the important qualities of his hair.<br><br>#1. You can;t use a comb to comb his hair<br><br>#2. His hair can be used to make tooth-brushes.<br><br>#3. You need to have a gardening scissors to cut his hair.<br><br>#4. Never put your hand inside his hair. Its like a black hole. It seems last time a rabbit went in and still it didn;t come out <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>#5. Stay away from his hair during rains. They may expand in any direction<br><br>#6. If you ever see a parrot/bird making nest on his hair, kick it out.(with a stick ofcourse, usage of hand can be dangerous <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) It might die.<br><br>I think this is enough. Ain't it?<br><br>Coming back to acads, this guy has biiiiig dreams and he's working hard to achieve them, pushing his limits everyday.

But as they say "In the end it doesn't even matter". How true! Our GPA's were the same till the end of last sem (3-2). But sala he got an awesome grade in honors project and now his GPA is greater than mine. But does that even matter?? We both stopped caring about our GPAs from the time when we were chaddi-buddies <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Coming to the most most important part of this testimonial.

<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>He's got a unique style of addressin everyone. Calls me "loundey", "chotu" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. and hence I call him "lambu". I never had friends whose height was more than mine rigth from mmy childhood days(Bachpan me main bhi lamba hua karta tha yaar!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). But now that convention is changed. I'm now friends with a 6"2 monster. But to be true, he's a kid at heart. A very nice guy. He's like a big brother to me, always gives me good advices (like drink daru <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, don't smoke, watch this movie, read that novel etc etc)<br><br>In first year, we were sitting in NBH mess having our breakfast and this guy comes to me and says "Hey! Do you know elections are coming closer? Please vote for me for the sportscom post.". I didn;t even know him, but there was some positive vibe in his way of talking that I was convinced to vote to him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and from then onwards we were like great friends. He has a very special place for friends (and also F.R.I.E.N.D.S <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) in his heart.<br><br>In second year, he was Maroo's roomie and I used to come to his room most of the time for doing ITWS project and this guy used to sleep like a bull. I sometimes still wonder that how come these two guys were room mates. I mean even today these guys fight for the "worst-room" in OBH competition. In 2nd year, I saw this guy very angry at somebody during the IBCT. I wish I'd never seen that scene. He was completely out of control. I, out of nowhere, wanted to control his anger but he's such a huge monster and I'm just a 5 point someone in front of him.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>After coming to OBH(ie in 3rd year), I came to know that this guy had the highest CGPA in our batch. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. This is all possible only because of dedication. That's what I call "Kasi" <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Also his dedication for gym can also be seen by having a good look at his body. He was a "kaadi pehalwan" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> in 1st year, but today his tashan is no less than Hrithik Roshan <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Also, smart to dikhta hi hai but stylish bhi hai.<br><br>Also he's one of those guys who never touches non-veg (just like me), daru, sutta or any such thing. Yesterday(21/04/09), I was all out and I told him some story/theory and he listened to it patiently and later laughed his ass off. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. The thing/theory which I told you yesterday holds true for everyone and in every situation. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Its like a universal law <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I want to write a lot of stuff about you. But right now, I've got many more testimonials to write.

<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I didn;t know that a guy named Manish Arora even existed in our batch till 2nd Sem. In 2nd sem we were supposed to perform in front of the faculty on 26th Jan. And so all the dancers of the batch got together and that was the time when I came to know that a guy named Manish from our class is going to share stage with me. I thought I never heard about this guy. But later came to know that this guy was one of the toppers of our batch. OMG OMG OMG !! silent killer type.<br><br>Even though we come from very different places and from completely different backgrounds, it took only night of practise for us to know each other quite closely. Whenever we saw each other we spoke about something or the other and not that our friendship was just limited to "Hi! and Bye!". And tell you what, this guy is full of energy. I'm very much amazed to see how he manages to do all things and still puts up a very cheerful smile on his face. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>Coming to the dance thing in first year. We performed "Masti ki paathshala" by puching in our own asses <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Also we danced on "Kudi kudi". But sala aaj tak hum donon ko bhi koi kudi nahii mili <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Milegi yaar! koi na!! optimism is the key <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's such a quick learner. We kinda lernt the dance in 1-2 days and with only a single practice we foded off on the stage. Kudos dude!!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vivekprakash.html>Vivek Prakash</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Vivek bhai ...<br><br>I met this guy during our freshers. He's a very enthusiastic guy. Active in everything. He used to sing, dance and even he was in skit (you remember "Kabhi aar kabhi paar" sequence <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Well, those were first year days. Later on he never participated in anything for the house.<br><br>When we were in GHEB, we were quite close we used to visit each others rooms quite frequently for Singing, Keyboard practice and what not. A very soft spoken guy who always has a plan for everyday and is always ready with the assignments and stuff 2-3 days before the deadline. But sala, never helped any of the guys <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. In some ways he's quite similar to me. I know many natural languages and he knows many programming languages <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We are both chubby <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>The most unforgettable moment with you would be doing "Kajra Re.." and "Kabhi aar.. kabhi paar.." on the stage. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.

He was not that talkative to me in the first year may be because we were in different sections in the beginning. But in second year, he came in form and I saw him ragging a few juniors. That was the time when even I was afraid of him coz I never thought this guy could be so harsh. I'd always seen him speaking to girls on phone in a very low voice.<br><br>Well coming to the cricket talent. Neelu is an awesome bowler <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.

I know that the guys screwed it up but it wasn't that bad after all.<br><br>And after that she was all silent types till the interhouse singing competition. She had already informed us in advance that she can;t sing. But still we selected her coz there were no other girls in Agni at that time. I'm pretty sure there was no sync in our voices. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And the next time I saw her on stage was during Felicity '06... dancing with Tavva. That was an awesome dance re.

I was personally so shocked to see that she knows so many movies when we were playing DumbC on rooftop. (especially Tarqeeb <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />). <br><br>Also she reads a lot of books/novels and writes nice blogs too.

I thought she will be very active and can be a great help to the house. But I was wrong. She never does anything for the house, except for the singing competition in first year. That was an awesome performance. We sang "Sasivadane" and her voice always standing out of the group. Win/Lose doesn't matter all that matters is fun <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Also I cannot forget about her "Randaka randaka" performance in Felicity '06 for which they won a prize.

But the story took a twist with the entry of G3. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>"Kasi" in studies. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>So there's spandy still cracking all PJs, teasing others and in an illusion that she speaks quite fluent Hindi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>But she's truly a great friend. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I always behave as if I've taken someone for granted.

(Dude, why don't you try for a villain role in Tollywood?? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) I think many juniors might have cried (literally) just looking at your face. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And if that is not enough, he's got a loud voice which creates vibrations in ribs <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All in all <b>Bhalu</b> is the perfect nickname for this guy.<br><br>The first word that comes to my mind when I see him is "Freak". And the next word is "Crazy". <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Bhalu is one of the biggest <b>BC baaz</b> of our batch. He can do BC anywhere anyplace. Then be it in mails, Twitter, im window, his room, my room, Chand's room(reg Batch trip <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), anyone's room, DLF, roof-top of the new building, toilets (huh!!), main building lawns, lab, coffee shop, Road dividers <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, water coolers, on walls, on trees etc etc. BC about teasing sbdy, politics, blogs, cricket, feeds, space, numbers/math, daru/sutta, people, music, girls, life/philosophy, courses, profs, school days, etc etc. And hence, I declare him as the most versatile BC baaz of the batch. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and is always ready to go to any extent when it comes to BCing. Once we went outside just for a small walk and we ended up reaching Kothaguda. Whenever he's with me, I feel like the rate of time has increased by 3 folds <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Doesn't play cricket on field but he has immense knowledge on the game, its rules and about its history. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to you for maintaining this database man!! In normal time he sleeps like a bull but during the time of cricket matches he;s like the lion coming out of the den. Hyperactive types. Gives all online commentary.

I like it when you're all angry <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but I don't have the courage to pull your leg when you are angry coz I'm afraid of the aftermath.<br><br>These days he's reading 3 newspapers a day and creating all nuisance on the floor by telling each and everyone whats happening. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Its good that you read more but please don't eat others' brains <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Coming to the main point. <b>Cricket. </b>Vimjam is one of the most powerful batsmans of our team. He cam beat the crap out of any bowler.

That was about batting. Now lets move to fielding. This guy rarely tries to catch the hold of the ball when somebody hits a ground shot.

And that was the main reason behind celebrating "14th Feb" as his birthday. Coz he'd never say anything to anyone and ofcourse the other main reason being the massive fan following for this guy both in and out side IIIT. Which is completely understandable coz girls are always flat over guys with heroic looks (btw did I tell you, he looks like Prabhas.

<b>For <a href=ambati.html>Bharat Ram Ambati</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>Ambati .. the name itself is enough <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br><br>It has been 5 years now and there's been a lotta change in this guys behaviour. Earlier he used to be like a friend, now he's like a big brother to me. Never seen anybody so matured and understanding and caring. A pure Gem. I'd never understand how he manages to do so many things at the same time. I mean going to hospital every week, doing shit loads of work, going for a trip with friends, BCing etc etc. Never saw him quarelling or arguing about anything. He always kept his doors open for me and was always a great moral support to me. Thanks for all the support dude.<br><br><br>During the inter days he was all chubby and cute with cheeks like 2 soft rubber balls. Even our warden liked to take a pinch. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. It was only after coming to IIIT that he lost all his weight and his chubby cheeks and all, but character remained more or less the same. In fact, he became much more cool and responsible. He believes in Simple living, high thinking. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><br>He's a very matured guy and always lends a helping hand to anyone. Apart from that, he's very generous, down to earth and soft-spoken. Very very very intelligent guy. Damn intelligent. He is the key factor behind my stay at IIIT for the last 4 years. I'd have failed many courses without you and your tutorials ra. We are all very dependent on his tutorials. Then be it Sanskrit or Graphics or even compilers for that sake, the only source of information was Bharat Ram. Sometimes I even think that if all the profs were as dedicated to the subject as Bharat Ram is or at least explain the subject in a way that makes the lecture more interesting(as Ambati does <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), I'd never hate studies. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He's the TA for almost every course taken by LTRC profs. And no doubt, he's the best. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> TA or no TA Ambati is the best. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Back then I didn't know how to control such situations. The fact is we both went near the building then I said "Abe tu bahut hil raha hai . aaj nahi kal karte hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". But saala he didn't agree with me and started running helter-skelter and ran like a mouse on seeing me or Chand bhai. That day I got brain-fucked be! But it was a memory worth remembering.

Apart from this, the other most memorable moments would be giving RDB pose for a pic with Charan. All those campus walks with Aditya. All those movies that I watched in his room and ROFL in his room. That ride to Tagore stadium for some crappy CAT class. Ragging a few guys in his room in 3rd year. And that dance, you remember dude? Aditya was in your room that day. My first time bike riding experience with you and Adi. OMG!! So many moments to cherish. And Aditya being in almost every special moment that we shared. We were like an awesome trio.

<b>For <a href=kishorepudi.html>Kishore Pudi</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>In first year, seniors used to call me up and asked me to call Kishore Pudi from our batch from phalana phalana room no. And I did that. That's how I came to know about Pudi. Back then every senior was a biiig fan of him. Today, the scenario is a lil different. Everybody in the college is his fan. Even Gurukul guys <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your soft spoken skills and your friendly nature.<br><br><br>Right from first year, he's PET's fav student. He's an awesome goal keeper. Saves almost every goal. Actually his physique helps him in carrying out this work properly <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. An awesome volleyball player too. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Also he's a very enthusiastic and dedicated organiser. And never gets angry even though you tease him like hell. That may be the reason why he got so many nick names. Vol pudi, scam pudi, downloader pudi, uploader pudi, bandwidth pudi, printer pudi, ethics pudi, rules pudi, a new nick butterfly pudi, this pudi, that pudi.. everytime he does something exciting and gets a special nick name. You'll be definitely remembered as the guy with highest number of nick names in 4 years of BTech <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br><br>Oh! The most important part of this testimonial : BANDWIDTH. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Would you wake up at 6 in the morning and download some arbit movie which some arbit guy requested the previous day on DC? When I ask this question to myself, my answer would be a big NO. But that's not how Pudi baba is. His dedication towards DC and its maintanance and all is worth mentioning. A big <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to you for your dedication brother. Even though you're not using <b>Wulfor</b> as your DC nick these days, the name has a special sentiment for all of us. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Couldn;t be more exciting than this. Also leofying Sharat together. And especially the Bhargava chettu thing in mess <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All those witty jokes in mess. Solving KK/Cache In in my room and eating pizzas. Playing business <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Swimming (btw.. he's the guy who taught me swimming in 10 days. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ). Drinking <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Going to Mock tests. Post Mock-test discussions. Arguments over his water bottle. And most importantly his smile. (VP chesesanu .. ippudu em peekutav peek ko kinda smile for which there are no replies). Himesh songs <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Equity pulse that we played in 2nd year. Well there are so many memories to cherish.<br><br>If I ever write a book on my BTech life, there would be a mention of this guys name on every page of it. That's how our friendship is.

<b>For <a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>I came very close to him when we were in 3rd year. He lived in the wing behind us. But our visit to his room was like a compulsory one at least once a day. Coz he shared many interests with us(sashi, sharat and me). He reads many books, loves solving sudoku(fuckin' fast at it), watches all the TV shows which we watch, plays small yet awesome online games, loves solving Hindu Crossword. And the most important thing, I've never seen anyone solve DI puzzles faster than this guy. Unfortunately, he screwed DI in CAT and I screwed quant which were like our fav subjs. Shit happens dude!! <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But one should've seen his face when he came to know that he screwed CAT. All smiles. Now thats some optimism. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Talking about vinay and not a single word about counters. Howz that possible. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> He is Counters king. He is the one in our batch who can counter "The great" Harsha. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. There's only one mantra in his life. "Spare no one, keep pulling everyone's leg". His creativity will come alive during the mess time. He looks like a very silent chap who is all busy doing his own work. But in reality, there's always something or the other creative going in his mind. He can be a real brain-fucker at times <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I didn't even know that there's a guy called vinay in my first year coz <b>A</b> He was so silent types <b>B</b> He was in B section. <b>C</b> He was in NBH. But come second year and he came adjacent to my room, became sashidhar's roomie and we had a ball.<br><br>I spoke to him first when we were doing OS assignments (He did all the work... I simply copied them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). It was then clear that this guy is an awesome coder. But that wasn't the real talent. The real talent came out on the day when we played Felicity Kode Konundrums in 3rd year. OMG! OMG! OMG! This guy must have brains faster than a computer. He's like the logic guru <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. In fourth year, when we were playing KK I came to know that for some question Somani wrote a code for 10 mins, which executed for 2 mins and still gave a wrong answer. Whereas, this guy simply looked at the question properly and told the answer in 1 min. Now that's some genious' work. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We used to play cricket in 2nd year summer. He always wanted to be wicket keeper and did a great job being a wicket keeper. That's how he earned his nick name "Gilly". Which is currently modified as "Gachibowli Gilly" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The Marooz the bondz ..<br><br><br>This guy is a real racha guy. Sarcastic, witty and humorous sometimes. But his most important quality is "Organizing". The best organizer ever. He's got awesome leadership qualities <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and incredible public speaking skills <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He always takes a different way of approach to solve any problem, then be it a campus life problem or a CAT question. A <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to his way of approach. He's both intelligent + hard working. A very rare combination, but in such case the result is always "success". A complete package of managerial skills.<br><br><br>He was also my ITWS project partner. He did almost everything <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Never let me do anything as long as it was not necessary. Also he used to give me good suggestions to read OS and all, but I never cared. That was the time when I came to know about his dedication and punctuality towards studies and in general too. If he said he'd do some work by 9:00, it would be ready by that time <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Never late. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your dedication and seriousness to whatever work you do. And this dedication of yours was clearly visible during the time of Felicity, which was a huge success. According to me, you are the best coordinator ever in the history of IIIT. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br><br>He also came to see the solo singing prelims of this year felicity and cheered for me.

<b>For <a href=smaddula.html>Siddardha Maddula</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>On the first day of college, I saw a bit blackish and plumpy guy and I wished, Oh God! Please don't let me sit beside him. But my wish never came true. This guy was my neighbour(in class as well as in hostel) and the only neighbour I had. To add icing on the cake he was also in A4, he was also my PCmate in workspace till the end of first year. So we HAD to attend all the tutorials and English classes together. God only knows how I tolerated him.<br><br>Believe it or not, this guy <b>slept in the very first class held in IIIT</b>. And I was not able to control my laugh seeing his face <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Eyes closed, his chin on his palm, face as oily as if the last time he washed his face was during stone age, body odour of like a shepherd and saliva drooling from his lips.. yuck!! Looking at his inncoent face, Madhava Krishna once asked him "Do you even belong to this class?". And we were all ROFL <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><br>Thats how his appereance is. Takes bath once in a month, never combes his hair, always comes to class with a cloudy (mabbu) face. That is the reason why he has been awarded the title of "Cloud Star" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>But looks are deceptive. He's a very talented guy, who listens to classes even while asleep, who plays Age and Dota awesomely, who is an awesome coder. Also he's very dedicated to his work. I came to know about his hidden talent when we were doing BTP under Prof. Rammurthy. Unlike my BTP partner, he helped me a lot making reports and presentations. Thanks for all the help dude.<br><br>The most unforgettable moment with this guy would be the night before BTP viva II. Both of us didn;t do anything but somehow managed to make an awesome presentation with all flashy effects(that how we convinced Ramu everytime <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). </b></i></ul><br><br>

A very calm and composed dude. A very good singer too. Writes awesome poetry. Always lends a helpful hand. That's all I knew about him in the first year.<br><br>During our Kerala trip I came to know that he's not just a good singer, he also sings from the bottom of his heart with all emotions and one can feel his emotions from his voice. The songs he choses to sing are very senti ones. <br><br>In third year, we both took part in Interhouse Collage competition and I came to know that he;s an exceptionally creative guy. Well, the judges were not able to see our creativity <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But that doesn;t prove anything. All I can tell you is that it was the Best. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your talent brother.<br><br>And today, he no more seems to be a guy from Dehradun. He looks like a stud. He's built an awesome body, bole to ekdum hero ke maafik. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and with his cool attitude and hot looks he's trying to impress everyone. Koi na koi to mil hi jayegi banglore me ... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Don't worries <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Well, the most memorable moment with this guy would be the time when we were travelling from Periyar to Cochin and singing the song "Pal bhar ke liye ..." in the bus.

Its a very difficult job to make somebody;s mood and you carried it out perfectly buddy <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I bow to thee. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.

Is it because I give all nice romantic ideas? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> Or is it because I'm a very matured guy who can understand your feelings? or is it because I respect privacy? Whatever the case may be thanks for your trust in me dude. Very few people tell me all the things close to their heart and that makes me feel proud of myself. You are one of them. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br><br>After coming to fourth year, I became very lazy but he used to wake me up daily for breakfast. Even today he wakes me up and that's how my day starts. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><br>Its very easy to leofy him. He rarely gets angry. So we keep pulling his leg everytime. If there's no one around, he comes into the spotlight and he never feels bad, howmuchever we leofy him. He's got many nick names. Loverboy, Plastic boy <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, renderchicha, the Dude, Adobe kaka, brand boy, sexy boy, Gova, spikes kid, etc etc. Also these days he's learning to speak fluent Hindi, which is not possible as long as you are close to us(the Hyderabadi Hindi speaking gang) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And I simply love the way he says "kyabbe salley" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Also he's got a biiiiiig fan following in GH. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I wrote a rap on him which completely describes him but still, I'd like to share some of the Awesome moments I shared with this guy. I rarely knew him in the first two years. We hardly spoke to each other. Only one thing I knew about him back then was that he's just the same as my roomie(Sharbat <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and they were both travelling in the same boat. <br><br><br>It was the summer of 2007, when he was all active with his interests of making posters and videos for Felicity. That was the time when we actually spoke to each other. Then I came to know that he's a very creative guy. Very much interested in what he's doing leave alone acads. And then we spoke a lot about different things. A very dedicated Movie/ TV Show viewer. He watches around 20 TV Shows parallely. Ask him about any show and he'll give the update. Such is the case with movies too. Gives awesome movie reviews. If Bhargava says some movie is not good, I won't even care to download it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><br>We share many interests, like movie directing, acting, making videos/spoofs, listening to music etc etc. But I never dedicated time towards my interests. We make a great director/screenplay-writer duo together with all my filmy knowledge and his advanced technological skills. He was the one who thought of creating a spoof of 'Heroes' and we pooled in all the ideas of how to make it but we rather ended up giving our project a new name "The Minus-H Crowd". Whenever we were together our ideas would make everyone around laugh. Mama What about Rowdies 5.oh! and the Ranga video! <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Be it soccer or studies or coding or even HSSMs, never gives up. A <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to his dedication. He also maintains a Schedule of what to do and when to do.

<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>KD .. Well, I didn't speak to her properly till last month .. and all of a sudden, after Felicity, she became a very close friend of mine . OMG! She's got a wonderful sense of humor. Some people of my wing (I'm not taking any names here) are actually afraid of her coz she can kill them with her sarcasm and humor and all they can do is sit quietly and pray to God to stop her. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> while all others just <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Sometimes you won;t even understand that you got blasted!

I was just kidding. That's how she is from outside. But she's very caring, jolly, friendly and a very outspoken person in reality <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. I never felt bored in her company even though I've known her for only a few days now. Some people leave such an impression. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>She's the one who uses "Ya" very frequently in an awesome tone. My X roomie is just fida on her style of saying "Ey! Come on Ya" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Infact me too. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Btw, never saw her reading/studying, So I dunno how she;s @ studies, but since she;s a girl, she must be very dedicated and hardworking. (Pure guess.

After coming to the collge I came to know that she has poetic intrests too. Writes some nice poetry (though I rarely read her poems <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). has a great sense of humor. and is always on the top at pulling others leg right from her childhood days. She's also a girl of her words. It was her birthday and I said I need a party coz I'm your oldest friend and she said Yes. I forgot about that but she personally called me and invited me to the party. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I keep asking parties(shamelessly <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) for everyone but rarely somebody invites me intentionally.

<b>For <a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I met Anu in 5th class. We rarely spoke. She was the most intelligent person of our class. Always stood first in class, ALWAYS <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Any exam, any test same result. We were all jealous of her <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . Its very difficult to remember anything from those good old days. But there are some instances that I can never forget. She was the one who always monitored the class and most of the times ended up writing my name on the board.(coz I used to do full " <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> " things in leisure periods <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). She gave beautiful greeting cards with nice messages to all the teachers. Back then she was the favorite student of every teacher. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>And then when I came to 6th class  she left "Nizamabad". Nobody knew where she'd gone. <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> And that was the time when I came first in the class for the first time. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>In 11th, a statewide IIT-JEE mock-test was conducted and the result was put up on the notice board. That day I saw the name 'Anupama' and I thought Bah! This is not possible. She can;t be the same Anupama I'd known in 5th class. Such things happen in movies only. Once a person lost is lost forever. It can't be true. But coincidence is such a strange thing. It was the same Anu. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> We still didn;t speak in 11th and 12th and then another strange thing happens. We both come to the same college. Now thats some strange coincidence, ain't it?<br><br>In workspace one day Anu asked me "Are you the guy from Nizamabad?" I said "Hmmm .. yeah!" and ran away.(Thats how I used to be in first year. Idiot. <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> Dumbo types <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) That day I felt that "Oh!

Back then I used to think that he's not open to all, a very conservative kind of a person.

Remember the eunuchs in train <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (Ae Chikne, chal paise nikal <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). And that climbing down the mountain that evening in Ooty.

<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sainani / Bacha / Scientist is one of the cuteeeest kids around. Never complaining about anything and always has a cute smile on his face. is a very good friend of  mine.<br><br>My first acquaintance with this guy was during the Freshers. We were in the front row doing "Kajra Re" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Then I knew that he;s a good dancer. We were also in the play doing some BC. <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> and from then on we were always together for the rest of first year. We used to do almost all of the assignments on our own <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. We used to go to the library <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> and he used to sleep there quite oftenly <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. One very important thing I have noticed about him in these 4 years is that he has a 'never say die' attitude and keeps fighting(sleep <img src=Smileys/24.gif />) for whatever he wants and never quits until it is achieved.<br><br>When I was in GHEB, I used to go to his room for time pass. coz Atul and Sainani were the best. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> There always used to be some or the other intresting topic. Always lives in his own world of fantasy. I still remember one day (before freshers)he said "Dont you think OBH is like an old palace where black magic wizards live <img src=Smileys/10.gif />".and I was like WTF?! <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> Whats he talking about?! Also he was very shy to speak the swear words. I think today he's comfortable using them. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>He has immense knowledge on literature and books. Whenever I'm bored I ask him to suggest one of his fav book and no doubt its A-W-Esome. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He was also my partner in DumbC in 1st and 4th year. It was a rocking experience to share stage with you both in Kajra Re and DumbC <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Baap bada na bhaiyya .. sabse bada rupaiya was his best performace ever in IIIT with all expressions and all. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Hope that with your 'never say die' attitude you reach great heights.<br><br>Love<br>DJ.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b> <i> part 2 </i></b><br><br>Ma darling is now a professor in LPU. I asked him one day "Arey mama oka ammayi ki marks takkuva vachyayanta. Marks penchukovataniiki room ki vastundi. Em chestav? (some girl got less marks in your subject and she;s coming to your room. What would you do?)" He immideatley answered "Naughty Punjab mchc(ma college's hot chick)<img src=Smileys/10.gif />" and we were all rofling. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>There are many thing I'm gonna miss about this douchebag. But the most unfrgettable moment with was RJing in 3rd year. He asked me to deliver a few dialogues and I was not able to do them properly. He said "I know you can do it. I believe in you. Just relax. You'll be the best RJ". And guess what, I did it. Whoa! Sharing stage with him is such an easy task. You don;t need to do much. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Thanks for that moral support bro <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. I'm gonna miss all that racha that we did during all the 4 Felicity major nights and Freshers'. Those rides to HiTech city. Buddha Pornima(remember <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). That adventure in HCU and many many more. But most important of all I'm gonna miss you dear. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>One small piece of advice: Everything is important. So are studies. I know you are the kind of a person who can set records in every field ONLY IF YOU WANT TO. But sometimes you have to show interest in other subjects as well at least to get passed. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. So please concentrate on your studeis in future. (if at all you are willing to study more <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>Ah! And the most important thing. I forgot to mention about his secret visits to Warangal. I haven't seen his girl but I can say that she must be a very pretty girl and a very very lucky person to have found a guy like Prudhvi. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> part 1 </i></b><br><br>Om Sai Ram ...<br><br>This guy is the most energetic guy I've ever seen in my life. One of my best friends in IIIT. HAs the capacity to pull almost anyone's leg. Most importantly I like his instantaneous perfect one-liners for perfect situations. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He was the "Racha coordinator" <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> of Felicity '08 and I'd never forget the racha that we did on the final day. When it comes to Racha I think it would be wrong if I don;t mention about the Bashi Songs. He was the first one to introduce me to the Bashi songs and we even remixed those songs (manam rawk mama .. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> recording eppudu cheddam cheppu.. nenu ready ..sye <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) He's got an awesome stage presence too. I still remember the way you STRIPPED on the stage for freshers <img src=Smileys/51.gif /><br><br>Lets move on to the next point. His <b> language </b>. Mama nee deggara nerchukovataniki chaala undi ra. I've learned a lot of thingd from this guy, especially the slangs. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . It wouldn't be wrrong to call him the "chalti-firti-slang-dictionary-of-iiit" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Always refers to me as darling. (and Byatch for Sharat <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) One good thing I noticed about this guy is that even when he's depressed, he never stops pulling others' leg and entertain people. Sometimes he seems to be very rude but actually he doesn't mean to hurt anyone. Its just his style and that most of us are not acquainted with it.<br><br><b> Sports </b> Man! One helluva sports person. There's no sport this guy can't play. Not a single one! Frankly speaking, in my first year I used to think that he does all show off on the ground. But I was wrong. Later I've come to a realization that I haven't seen a sportsman better than him in the 4 years of my college life. And yeah! Hats off to his sportive spirit. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The speech that he gave on sports meet '07 was one of the awesome-est one. So be it Volleyball, Cricket, Soccer, BB, Rugby, (throwball include cheyyala mama.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) he's game.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nvkartheek.html>MNV Kartheek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>neeku first testimonial nenu raddam anukunna .. screw you Lashi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..<br><br>anyways .. MNV is one of the coolest doods of our batch. just that most people don;t know about him. Coz he's always busy doing some projects. Unfortunately he is in ECD (dual degree <img src=Smileys/7.gif />) and works very hard to keep up. One thing I like about this chap is that he is very prominent and punctual <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Open to talk to everyone. One more thing that people might not know about him is that he is a linux g33k. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>He's also a very hard working guy. Very ambitious. He's so honestly working that his mentor in GE gifted him an iPod for his contribution. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Yet he's so simple. Has an aweomse taste for movies. There was a time when I used to watch ONLY those movies which were recommended by him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Never gets angry at me how much ever I pull his leg <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. And always believes in me. Always gives a feeling that "I'm always there for you brother" <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Came to know more about him from Sashidhar when they were room mates in Bangalore. These guys did many "koti panulu" <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> at Bangalore and always after doing some koti pani they used to call me up and tell me about those.<br><br>Coming to sports, he plays foorball (never watched him playing but people say he's AWESOME <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). <br><br>One of my best friends in IIIT. I'm gonna miss you a lot buddy. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> I'm gonna miss all those conversations we had in mess. Those movie critics. Everything.<br><br>Be as you are. Don't ever stop smiling. Some faces look incomplete without a smile. Yours is one of them. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> You are a very good person. A kind of a person who can change somebody's life. Don;t think much about what you said to others and what others think about you. <br><br>All the best for your thesis. I feel lucky to have met an awesome guy like you. And yeah!

I don't remeber having spoken to him in first year but from second year onwards we were like great friends. Thanks to that Sunday Carnival. We were supposed to organize 'campus-treasure-hunt'. And we did it SUCCESSFULLY. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br><br>To be frank, in first year I used to think that Vigla is autistic, nerdy types <img src=Smileys/26.gif />. It took some time for our friendship to grow but as of today it has grown out to be very strong. and I'm proud of it. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>We came more closer during the Felicity 07 time. Just one day before the event seniors asked us ot prepare the clues and we were like WTF! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> but still we managed to re-make the clues and get them printed out and conduct the event in right time. ( Now that you are my colleague we'll organize a treasure hunt in Verizon too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) And that was the day when I recognized his talent. We made around 40 clues in 1 day ><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><(night, to be more specific). After the event we laughed our asses off looking at the dumbness <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> of NIFT guys <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. I'm never gonna forget that moment. Even today whenevr it comes to campus treasure hunt, he'll be my first choice as a partner (coz hum log campus ka chappa chappa jaante hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>And then Vigla asked me to set questions for Cache In too. I wasn;t a memebr but he trusted me and asked me to make questions. That must be the unforgettable moment with you yaar. Woh Shrikant ko 'pehchaan koun?' wale ping karna <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul. What should I say about him. His email id says it all. Truly a very rocking personality. I still remember how we met in first year. We went to the Agni house meet as strangers and came out as if we were some 'bichade hue dost'. Multi-talented person. I'd always remmebr him for all the BC sessions we've had in music room during our first and 2nd years.<br><br>Our voice blends very finely and we still sing along whenever we're together. He's such a good singer. kabhi kabhi 'sh' ko 'sa' kar deta hai .. but sala aawaz me jo dard hai woh in saari khamiyon ko nazarandaaz kar deta hai. A very dedicated singer ><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><. An awesome guitar player. When we came to IIIT, he had no idea how to play a guitar but come 3rd year and he made a band (all by himslef)and played live during Riders on the storm. And What a show it was! Amazing! Mind Blowing! Especially "what I've done" number.<br><br>We used to do all the physics/ITWS assignments in first sem and that was the time when I came to know taht this guy is a bond of physics. He's so interested in physics that he even solved some physics problem in zulu's class for which Zulu gave a biiiiig lecture for not paying attention. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> And how can we forget Mukku. His alltime favourite <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>As we came in 3rd year, Atul from Rewa became Atul - the cult Captain of Agni house. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We always used to think that someday he'll be the captain and I'll be the rep and we'll rock the houses. We did well (as usual). He was, indeed, a very good captain. ><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><<br><br>An awesome basketball player and the most important thing was that he played for the house when there was no one else in our house and I must say amongst such a fierce competition, he did well. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>I'll miss all those BC sessions in music room.
