A very good orator too. He has won various prizes in debates <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> This paid him during his IIM-I interview, jo isne phod diya. Reading his interview, everyone was sure that he'll be selected....and truly so. U can refer<br>http://karanatiiit.wordpress.com/2009/02/<br><br>During placement, I still remember the amount of preparation he had done was really appreciable.

<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kapil Bajaj or KBC, bajju is one of the most hard-working guy in our batch.

He has helped me a lot during placements, told me which material to read, important questions, also gave his notes. Also gave me a lot of moral support then. One thing I am sure of is, kisi ne bhi bajju se better notes nahi banaaye honge C++ concepts ke <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>A very good athlete and basketball player. Very competitive in nature, he is a bit egoistic too when it comes to his favourite sport. But that's only on the court.

Very good in acads. Whichever course he takes, goes regularly to class, listens to the professor, asks doubts(if any), do revision at room, reads from the book <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ......awesome. During exams he teaches courses to his friends (only), though sometimes he gets less marks than them in the midsems. But, still thanks a lot Rahul, you taught me a lot of courses. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is very much health conscious. When he came to college, he was overweight, but now he has reduced it a lot. Try to look slimmer <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But still, kudos to his dedication towards jogging, goes till HCU main gate daily. Though he is athletic, but not good in any sport <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <i>bachpan se padhta hi raha hai </i> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Likes to hang around with friends, have fun, fond of photo sessions with a genuine smile <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Very much hygene concerned, when it comes to eatables.

Har cheez khareedne se pehle, expiry date jaroor check karta hai.....be it a cold-drink. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Don't like doing BC.

<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Dandu, Gargoyle aka Pegasus, I know him sence he did the role of PTI ( hip rotation) during our freshers <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a pro when it comes to computer games.

Knows IMDB rating of almost every movie <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Once, we were playing DumbC, one of our friend(who was acting) just gave hint that it is a 6 lettered english movie...Instanly Dandu said "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", and guess wht, it was correct. We all were like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Always ready to go to Coffee Shop, or any place outside to eat...and gets the highest bill among all of us.

<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>V4Veer, the very first person whom I met when I joined here. Doing MS here, no one knows college se kab niklega. But, I really liked his decision to complete his MS under K.Shrinathan Sir. Pls jab bhi teri MS presentation ho, mujhe jaroor bulana.<br><br>We have been together since first years. We were among the first persons in our batch, who gave the ragging. He took me to the gym, and within a mintue we found ourselves surrounded by the seniors. I still remember the way, isne seniors ka ragging mein kaata tha. He made them extremely senti by saying that he belongs to a village and is very poor. He has never seen a TV. I was really laughing on the seniors that time, bechaare. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>We had lots of outings during first two years, then (I still don't know the reason) he suddenly stopped talking, go outside with us. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But since we are in Batch Cricket team, I am always in touch with him.<br><br>The most dedicated person in sports I have seen in past 4 years <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Koi bhi match ho, ya practice ho, hamesha field pe dikh jaata hai. He is a very good cricketer. A gifted batsman and a reasonably good bowler and fielder. <br>He helped me a lot in becoming a good fielder, gave me a dozen of catches.  <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Plays Chess very well too.

He worked a lot on the Equity Pulse during Felicity'08. ALso organised various cricket tounaments during carnival. IPL was a big hit.<br><br>Most of the times, he is seen with juniors. He is like an idol for them. I appreciate his bold nature to speak whatever he feels and to stand on his point. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>All the best Veer fro your future.

He has learnt lots of new technologies in no time and has completed various projects on them. Whatever the project is, one always wants to keep him in his team. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Apart from this, he is a very good athlete. Plays cricket and football very well. Cricket mein sweep shot ke liye famous hai, kyonki isko bas ek wohi shot khelna aata hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Bowling to bilkul nahi aati <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, but a nice fielder.<br><br>We had lots of outing together, and one of it was unforgettable. We went to celebrate our Cache-in win, Viglu ne auto waale ko poore hyderabad ghuma diya(restaurant nahi mila) and we ended nowhere except spending 1000 bucks in travelling <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Finally went to Pizza Hut and had fun.<br><br>Kudos to his friendly and extremely helping nature.

Movies dekhta hai exam mein, to tease us. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Both of us got room on the same floor in NBH. When I met him first time, I found him a little arrogant( poor judgement) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  and I also told Sambhav, he'll not be in our (so called) group for a long time. But, he has changed himself a lot since then <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Now he is more mature. We also went to his home several times and had great lunch (ghar ka khaana <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> )<br><br>Classes mein schedule time se 5 min pehle pahunch jaata hai (till date), listen to prof. with full concentration, doubts poochhta hai (kabhi-2 hum frusta jaate hain, koi ise chup karaao, taaki class jaldi khatm ho <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), room pe revision karta ahi, assignments time se pehle hi submit kar deta hai.

<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Call him Sam or Mr. Jain or <b>Tinka</b> or Sambhav, he deserves a special testimonial. To be honest, he is one of my closest friend whom I consider as the most complete guy around me. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I know him since our JEE coaching, although we were not close friends then, but still I still remember he use to come to classes on a scooter, <b>neatly dressed, tidy, smart looking, extremely sincere, punctual, confident</b> <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Then we met again during our AIEEE councelling, he was explaining Shikha which college to take or reject <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , try to bachpan se hi kar raha hai, par abhi tak single hai <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Ek baar NTR garden mein bhi ek <i>chinki</i> ko propose kar diya tha josh josh mein, but kat gaya <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>College mein aane ke baad to ragging ke time saare bansalites jab ek saath chhupte rehte the, tab tinke se dosti hui. I was highly impressed by his nature. He is an <b>all-rounder</b>.

Padhata bhi mast hai, bahut saare courses pass karaye hain isne. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>BC karne raat raat tak laga rehta hai, aur sabse itna close hai ki, kahin bhi kisi bhi topic pe BC karta dikhaai de jaayega. During the second year we played lots of cricket and football together, awesome bowling karta hai, batting bhi theek kar leta hai. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Gaane mein iska jawaab nahi, I still remember he won a prize in singing during our Ramoji trip. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Hats-off dude, again to your allround character.<br><br>continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sachin aka KK, is bindaas and one of the coolest <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> person around me. Bilkul bhi tension nahi leta, bas apne room mein pada rehta hai, movies or sitcome chalte rehte hain aur ye kuchh-2 karta rehta hai. Bahut hi <b>aalsi</b> hai.<br>I came in touch with him in the second year, felicty. We won the antakshri competition then. Bahut hi besura hai KK, but has a good database of songs. What makes him more hilarious is the way he talks, many a time, he is out of words and then makes you guessing what he intended to say. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>He is an awesome programmer too, 1st year mein aisa lagta tha "kaun hai ye ch***ya jo apne aap ko hero samajhta hai", but when I knew him, he is really very <b>helping</b> and <b>kind hearted</b> person. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Class mein hum dono saath-2 hi baithte hain, bahut BC karte hain, kisi na kisi tarah time pass ho hi jaata hai. KK computer games bhi phodu khelta hai.  In CS, he kills you lots of time having <b>No Mercy</b>. Cricket bhi theek khel leta hai, generally I keeps him in my team, beacuse I m highly impressed by his late cut on backfoot. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>We had lots of night outs together playing cards. Somani ki saath milke bahut li hai 29 mein. <img src=Smileys/51.gif /><br>Another thing which I appreciate of him is that he is rarely double minded. Soch samajh ke sahi decision leta hai.<br><br>All the best KK for your future, Bangalore mein jaldi se koi ladki pata le, taaki aur masti kar sake <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , aur hamein kabhi bhool na jaana <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitingupta.html>Nitin Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nitin or Gupt(h)a is one of the tallest student in our batch, iska <i>dil</i> bhi bahut bada hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> (as said by t.rahul)<br>We are together since first year, and since both of us are from same state, we share common thoughts and interest. Nature se bahut hi <b>bhola</b> hai, hamesha khush rehta hai.<br><b>Dance</b> to awesome karta hai ^<img src=Smileys/3.gif />^ , "Aari aari" is one of his renowned performances along with "Aisa Jaadu". Cricket mein bhi jo match khelta hai wo hum jeet jaate hain, though he has little contribution <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Although he is not a good fielder, but took a sitter in the last match he played.<br>During placement he was placed before us, but gave me and bansi a lot of moral support <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Felicity'08 mein bhi he was one of the main organiser.<br>Ladkiyon ke maamle mein kaafi lucky hai, train ho, bus ho ya riksha ho, saale ko koi na koi mil hi jaati hai, aur bhola sa gupta bekaabu hokar fisal hi jaata hai. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>We have taken almost all the same courses during our B.Tech. aur classes mein khoob masti kari hai. Gupta kabhi classes mein nahi dhyaan deta, par time pass mast karta hai. Grades bhi badhiya aati hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Some of our <b>favourite memories</b> are playing cricket on NBH 3rd floor and on BB Court, watching lots of movies together, batch trip, bird watching and commenting on them, and other outings in hyderabad. <img src=Smileys/51.gif /><br>All the best Gupta for future in IVY, hoping to be together in hyderabad and having loads of fun.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitin.html>Nitin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nitin Bansal aka <b>Bansi</b> is one of the most <i>quick witted</i> person, I've come across with. He has a spl talent of cracking jokes at u now n den & has a strange but funny kind of sense of humor.<br>"...Appearence can be deceptive"..Yes he is the live example of it. What appeared to me in the 1st year, a studious person was actually a actually a fun loving guy. He has changed a lot since then, pehle bilkul dabbu dikhta tha, abhi rockstar ban gaya hai.<br>TV shows, movies dekhne ka ultimate chaska laga bansi ko college aane ke baad, but a small request, <b>pls movies dekhte waqt so mat jaaya kar</b> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . FIFA bhi awesome khelta hai.<br><b>Height of Frustaapa</b> : Frist year mein jab kisi ke paas laptop nahi tha, tab dandu ke room mein Nitin* ne classes bunk maarke ultimate stuff dekha hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>Overall, a very nice and caring person to be with. We have spent ample time discussing all weird things frm fiction to gals, uncountable nightouts playing taash.....<br>share some common interets, mode of thinking, BTP, copmany....<br>He is an awesome pal, someone with whom u wud like to be friends with forever...All the best Bansi for your future, hope we'll get our joining letter soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhinav '<b>bhole to</b>' Paro aka S..S..S..Saarukh <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> is a hard working guy. He is very dedicated and sincere towards his work. From the 1st sem till date, he is concerned about his studies, although CG itni achchhi nahi hai, but believe me he has more technical knowledge than anyone else. By nature he is a shy person, who knows himself well under his limitations. <br>Photos khichaane ka bhi bada shauk hai ise, always ready with a new pose.<br><i>A brief Incident</i>Once, Gupta (of course, Nitin) has to give him 5 Rs., gupta nahi de raha tha. He took gupta's facewash, used it for 5 days and returned it back to him. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>Still, a very friendly person indeed. All the best paro for your future. Hope you won't forget me <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
