<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Oye Kalkote aka Maratha Warrior ,<br>tu to meri testi likhega nahi..socha main hi likh deta hoon.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Yaar my testimonial might be short and simple but i'll write what i really think about u.<br>Starting main to muze lagta tha ki  tu mand buddhhi hai...but as time passes and grades were out, i realized it was me who was mand buddhi and on the contrary kalkote is one of the most sharp minded guy of our batch. He thinks about the right way to do things  rather then executing them straigtaway. We had very formal relation for around 6-7 semester but in around last semester same floor par rahne se thoda jyada contact main aaye and started enjoying each and every meeting.<br>We alwasy have very unique and different type of chat, no matter what the topic is, we always talk about that logically and try to figure out things we can laugh at <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , and really i m loving it. <br><br>Sometime i think he is very good friend of mine but somtimes sala thodi distance bana leta hai. Par jo bhi ho...banda bada hi awesome hai... CAT fod ke isne prove kar diya hai ki he is the Best !!<br>Got placed in Google and i hope ki daily muze (along with mux) lunch ke liye invite karega.  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Likhne ko to bahut kuch hai but jitna bhi likhoonga...ultimately overall sense wahi rahega. I wish we have  lot more to talk about and share in the time to come<br><br>Do remember me as a funny guy and good friend of yours <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Don't forget to invite me on ur marriage party. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>NOVIRUS !! <br> Aaj poora man bana liya tha but sale ne pahle meri testi likh daali ... <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br> <br>Everyone wants to become like him. Our friendship started a long back but i don't remeber when, bande ko jaanne ke liye oossse baat karna jaroori nahi hai, i knew about him a lot right from the starting. Actually i always wanted him to be a good friend of mine...i don't know how far i m succeeded but if i am not there...i'll wait and keep trying <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>His confidence in what he believes in and what he knows is exception, no matter how hard you try to convince him, kabhi nahi maanega.(sometimes its so obvious !!) This unique and extraordinary characteristcs makes him the heighest CG wala banda in out batch, yeah this has its own shortcomings but overall i admire it.<br>Playing FIFA, VOLLEYBALL and CS with him is really something. I used to find atleast 10 people who were ready to play FIFA 07 anytime but i always asked manish if he wants to play because i really enjoyed it. Specially on that night when he came along with Khatri and yeah we both did beat him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Humara room kabhi bhi paas paas nahi ho paya in 4 years <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> , never had many one on one chat, so couldn't share much of our past life or had any senti talk (i am sure he is a great listener ), jab bhi hum milte hai but ek doosre ko hasaane ki hi baatein karte hai .  Sometimes haste huye  u can see very clearly that he is not actually enjoying it but still just for the sack of  other's intentions, he gives him the kind of company what the other person is expecting.<br><br>Bus yaar, bahut hi uniform relation raha humara, no ups and downs and we both liked it in that way .<br><br>Chal yaar....Good luck kahne ki jaroorat nahi hai, tu vaise bhi bahut hi successfull hone wala hai future main...but bhool mat jayiyo..vaise main bhoolne doonga nahi as long as you are in Microsoft, roz aa jaya karoonga tang karne...<br><br> Shaadi par bulana mat bhoolna. Aur jab bhi ye testi padhe (obviously after leaving this college) call karna mat bhoolna.<br><br><br><br> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>hey dost......<br>not long since i really started knowing u.. but few things i can say for sure...<br>stylish is what defines u best....<br>naughty, hard working and cool nerves<br>u carry ur self well enough and looks really calm frm ooutside, but things keep ur mind occupied.<br>a good frnd and a nice company...<br><br>keep rocking and all the best</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deepu, dat's what i call him. We hardly met(one on one) in 1st and 2nd yr, don't remember much of those meetings but what i could remember is his helpful and friendly nature. I don't know how he manages but this guy never says NO to anyone, to anything. You might want to knock his door anytime but he never complains about it. He is ambitious and at the same time hardworking also. He is a bit shy in front of girls like most of us <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, waiting for THE ONE (she must be very lucky <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), believes in long term relationships with everyone he consider as a friend or more.<br>We have become very good friends in 4th year and i did learn a lot from this guy and still learning <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>He is good at cricket and volleyball, used to play soccer in first year but IIIT Ground ruined his football career. Let me share something about his nature which most of us don't know or never realized is that everyone (i mean everyone) will feel very comfortable around him because he is a good listener, caring and helpful(what else u need ) but he feels comfortable with few (very few) in IIIT, doesn't share much to most of us, i feel very happy that he shares his feelings and past life with me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , The best thing i like about him is that he always think about the ways in which he can make his parents happy.(yeah, we all do think but believe me not as much as he does)<br>I consider myself to be a good critic, i always try to point out mistakes and negative points about anything (or anyone), but i don't have anything for deepak ( i mean it), he is very simple aur kabhi bhi gussa nahi aata . In the end, i wish he gets whatever he wishes for very soon and our friendship never ends.<br>Sometimes I hurt people's  feelings (with the reason, they don't understand) at anytime and most of the time i don't regret, but deepak i am really really sorry if i ever did to you in past and sorry in advance if i do that in the time to come ( i am going to regret that for sure)<br><br>Shaadi par bulana mat bhoolna <img src=Smileys/3.gif />  <br><br>Good Luck for rest of your life. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>PART 2 </b><br><b>2nd Year & 3rd Year: </b> It's in my nature ki agar ek baar baat karna band kar deta hoon to never look back and same case was there with GeeKay, we hardly talked to each other in two years, apart from asking for a pass while playing baskeball <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  and as time passes, we realized  ki it's too late to start it all over again. I had a great time during 2nd and 3rd year, i wish you were there as a friend. <br><br><b> 4th Year: </b> Hmm... 7th Sem bhi nikal gaya and hardly talked to each other, but then i don't know what happened to this guy, just after getting placed he changed himself drastically and started to be there for everyone, Nagarjuna Sagar chala, volleyball khelna regular start kar diya, continuously BC karna start kiya and suddenly i couln't find his unpredictable nature anymore, and i told you, except from his unpredictable behaviour he is one of the best guy i've ever met and once again in no time WE BECAME FRIENDS <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, GeeKay ke saath bethkar kisi ki lene main jo maza hai wo kahin nahi...khas taur par Daandu ki <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , we could spend a lot more time together but we couldn't, i am not saying it's your fault but whoever fault it was, we missed around 2 and a half year and i know will never get back. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>I wish GeeKay, in future you find many good friends and have a great time ahead and enjoy your life at its most. You are the most talented guy i've ever seen so no matter kitna bhi bad luck ho, still you'll managed to have a bright future. <br><br>PS: Shaadi par invite karna mat bhoolna.<br>PS: v4veer@gmail.com</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hey<b> KhaDAKwal,</b> <br>		Teri Testi to main dehati main hi likhoonga...pata chala ki bhawnaye samazne ki jagha english grammer ki mistake hi nikalta rah gaya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>* First of all, am not going to write a formal testimonial.<br>* I want you to call/contact me every time you read it (ofcourse after leaving this institute)<br>* I am writing my viewpoint here, so you must not take it as a general opinion.<br><br><b>1st Year:</b> We were in the same Human Value group and among first few to attend first ever shivir of Jivan Vidhya in IIIT-HACH, so ofcourse we were friends right from the kick-off. I was so impressed by his intellegence and english speaking style and most of us had the same view in the beginning. But this fellow never been in any relation (friends) for so long before coming to IIIT-HACH, so had no idea how to get going with everyone. Around after 1st sem most of us started to critisizing GeeKay for his rudeness and arogance but they didn't know that its not his fault, even i did face his unpredictable behaviour few times but i decided to stay there as his friend and wait untill he gets changed because apart from few, he is a great guy with multi talents. You know what GeeKay, i tried my best yaar but everytime you disappointed me, you were so unpredicatable ki ek pal to aapke saath haske baat kar raha hai aur next moment oothke chal diya. I realized ki Geekay ka koi achha friend hai hi nahi college main, but muze laga ki dheere dheere GeeKay sudhar jayega so once again i waited and this time GeeKay thoda sudhar gaya, he started to respect everyone and we became very good friends, at the end of first year hum itne achhe dost ho gaye the ki log oosko critisize karna band kar dete in front of me. But unfortunately GeeKay ne fir se U-turn liya aur showed his unpredicatblility and this time i couldn't stay there any longer and decided to leave him alone, he came to me and said Sorry, but i knew he wouldn't change, not soon enough. <br>			This was our first year together, many ups and downs but really  had a great time</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>chalo yaar...sambhav ke liye likh hi deta hoon.<br>hmm...main bhabhi ki kasam khakar kahta hoon...jo kuch kahoonga sach kahoonga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>we are good friends...he used to be very good in 2nd year...but then something changed between us and then i've never been so comfortable  around him  <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> (told u..jo kahoonga sach kahoonga) he is still very caring and helpful to me and i respect that more than anything. He is an all-rounder, not because he plays,sings and studies but because he plays all kind of sports, good in every aspect when comes to cultural field and bond of every subject in studies. Don't want to praise him anymore because we all know about it. <br><br><b> I'll always remember him as </b> -- Tinka and for his modesty<br><b> Best time spent with him </b> -- Summer 07<br><b> Why would he hate me </b> -- bahut li hai tinke ki maine <br><b> Message for him </b> -- Good Luck for the time to come. Listen very carefully Tinke - "Even if i don't talk to you in years, you'll still be my good friend as you are now."  Shaadi par invite karna mat bhoolna TINKE !!<br><br>Have a happy life.<br><br>Sorry for this short and straight testimonial but that's me,what can i do. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
