<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He works so much, I can't even dream of working so much... while sitting in lab I look forward to get back to my room and he spends most of his day in lab. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>During the discussion about changing system for dual degree students and providing them flexibility and alternate options, Vibhav was the only person to say that since we've signed up for this, we must go through it, focus on our work rather than worry about placements, do good work and not make this dual degree thing look like a punishment for the juniors. I salute you. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>First thing you'll notice about him is his long curly hair jo ki naturally curly hain... logo ne inse inke baalo ka raaz poocha informals mein and he said, main kuch nahi karta hoon, apne aap aise hi grow karte hain, and won the title for best hairstyle! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! oh we're toh staying here only! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Vibhav aka Bon aka Bachha</u><br><br>This guy is one of the biggest achiever of the batch.. GE ki funding, papers published and cited by bade log. Ofcourse his grit and dedication has brought him here.I still remember once I saw him in front of motorola, he had been slogging a lot and his eyes looked all hazed and he seemed so lost that he wouldnt even recognize me. It was only when I called him that he realised it was me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Sangal sir always says about Jeevan Vidya and bonding while we have always been in favour of sutta n daroo being the bonding factors. With him, its been cigs which have bonded us a lot. He being the only guy in our group who would share a smoke with me, we would so many times go and have a cigaratte and some of those walks have been real memorable. It always feels nice to know that you are important enough to a person that he would share the most intimate things in his life and I am so lucky to have been able to don this role for him. Thanks a lot for being so nice man.<br><br>He is one of those guys who tend to be so concerned about others, at times when I would sustain some minor injury, he would look so concerned and all. It becomes so strange, if I look at that minor niggle which i might have suffered just to know kya hua, he would look at it with more interest and concern, that's why I would just leave it off to later until he is gone. <br><br>I have always enjoyed beating him, the sounds that he make, really worth it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is a true researcher in every way..till 2nd year he was one among us...but he changed in 3rd year...he was then this dedicated guy who didn used to sleep for 2-3 nights in continuation to work...he did all the dip assignements and I copied from him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...he taught a lot of vision subjects to us...In one year he transformed completely <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... well I love his maggie noodles hairs ...awesome curls hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....he is this carefree person jiske liye uski research hi sab kuch...I often suggest him to get a room in cvit lab itself ...coz he hardly stays at room...<br>But he is very helpful...from lending assignments,using his megatron, solving my doubts, encouraging me for MS, showing so much confidence in me when I wasn't sure of myself...<br>he told me once 'If you cannot do it then nobody else can ' -so sweet of him....<br>He has always been a source of inspiration...<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>When we think of home theatres,cars, etc... he thinks of owning jet airplane etc..<br>He has an altogether different outlook of life...<br>To tell it in one word 'he rocks <img src=Smileys/41.gif />'<br><br>All the Best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dedicated. Passionate. Hard working. Focussed. Determined. Intelligent. Fun loving. Impulsive. Sublime.<br>These are only a "few" adjectives that come to my mind which very aptly describe him. Though he can be a pain in the ass at times <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, a little annoying but otherwise he is fun to be with. I hardly knew him in first two years. In third year we shared the same wing. I got to know him little bit everytime we had a chat. He has accumulated a lot of knowledge on a lot of different topics, from politics to history, from science to movies, from wrestling to cricket. Its fun to discuss with him on all these topics. I remember discussing about different topics with him. <br>His dedication towards his work is the first thing people close to him will tell you. It's like he knows and has planned his future. He will go at length to make sure he achieve his goals. I know that it needs a lot of sacrifice. I have seen him working his ass off, sleeping only for a few hours in two-three days <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I sincerely hope you achieve whatever it is that you want. In a short span of four years, he has managed to do a lot of things that others can only dream of. He has a few research papers to his credit and some are still in process. He also grabbed a fellowship from GE.<br>All in all, I am gonna miss you buddy. I wish to see you, ten years down the line, guiding the computer technology world or whatever you choose your field as. Will miss you, all the best to you. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>I'd also remember Vibhav for all the help he has rendered. He was unable to work for Felicity because of the vagaries of CVIT, but one little incident will stay etched in my memory. I was quite busy with Felicity, when he came up and asked me how things were. When he came to know that I had a lot of documents stored on my pc, he immediately offered me a remote pc to store all my stuff, have a backup. He offered to do all that for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Its also very sweet of him to lend me his laptop charger <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Other memories about him would be leofying him with various girls, his long hair, daroo parties and uske 'kaand' <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , he telling me his life story in the canteen <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> etc.<br><br>Wish you all the very best mate.. May you own the biggest graphics company in the world!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Did I hear Einstein? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: Club 8 party when he was royally out.<br>Message for him: Cribbing doesn't suit you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Baccha.. First impressions about this guy, a smiling nerd, not an assasin though <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . The impression stills holds good today, but its much more than a nerd today. You have to find a new term for it today!<br><br>This guy lives in the extremes.. He'd do anything to achieve something which he likes. We've seen that with research.. He is really into it, and does everything to achieve it. He is a slogger, a true ant. I don't need to state his achievements - its amazing to see a guy from some village (Begusarai) in Bihar come and conquer the world.. Rub shoulders with big names in the Vision industry. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Inspiring indeed!<br><br>He was like this in first year.. He knew what he wanted out of life, and one could see it with the way he put in effort into his acads. I'd visit Adi and his room just about every day, and he'd never cease to amaze or never disappoint - always into C/C++! In fact, I found him to be a bit of a snob back then, but perceptions changed after he started hanging out with us. He actually loves his friends, especially Chand and Pagare and loves spending time with them. Hes an advocate of the group unity, always talks about we eating together at the mess table. Especially given that he doesn't  too much bakar in the wings. Its sometimes a little sad that he can't get too much time with us, but then he's chosen his priorities in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Vibhav also has a fair bit of knowledge about things around him, it was fun discussing politics and cricket with him. However, I feel that he shoudn't be cribbing about stuff in college without actually getting up and doing something.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>It is actually so hard not to admire Vibhav that I actually don't do it coz then that would be the only thing left to do. His geniousity and grit are hard to match.He is that one of a kind unique student who dares to dream big and act accordingly. He has the guts to go that extra mile and achieve the unachievable. At this tender age, he has tasted a lot of success and he is just raring to go and reach the optimal levels of endurance. <br><br>A totally outspoken guy who speaks his mind at will fearlessly. He loves debating and is very adamant on his arguments. He has learnt alot in his life through his experiences. After a troubled childhood he was determined to do something fruitful for his family and he is on th best possible path to carry the spirit.<br><br>One of the most conspicuous creatures around, he captures attention through his weird statements spoken in an even weirder tone. We have had some memorable moments together and I will cherish them throughout my life. Especially the times when he used to tell me about his love interests, likes, dislikes, and life in general. I respect your uniqueness and the path you have chosen for yourself. And we would be always be bros throughout our lives. All the best in life.<br><br>Song for you: vo to hai albela, hazaaron mein akela.<br><br>Your bro<br>Baba</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br><br>Then we moved to OBH after 2nd year and he chose CVIT for doing his MS. Kya dedication se kaam kiya hai bande ne vahan par. I don't know if many people in our batch know this or not but he is a well known researcher in that field. Wherever Dr PJN goes, he talks about him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . His paper(which is quite popular by itself) has also been used as a reference by a popular paper of that field. He has got fellowship as well and in future, his expenditure on studies (including PhD) will be incurred by that company. I hope that he get an internship in MSR - Redmond. And I pray to God that he get admission for PhD in whatever university he wants <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Jab enjoy karne par aata hai to enjoy bhi full karta hai. Peekar jo isne kaand kiye hain vo to ab har kisi ko pata hi hain. You are a very good friend for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I hope our friendship grows more and more stronger with time. This is my confidence that you will definitely achieve whatever you want in life. All the best for your start-up. Hope you start it soon and it becomes a big-big success <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Keep in touch. Bahar jakar humein bhool mat jaiyo. Phone karta rahiyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Aur tu kitna hi bada ban jaye, mere liye chotu hi rahega <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Wish you all the luck for your future chotu <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. God bless !! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br><br>Vibhav aka Bachcha<br><br>I like to call him Chotu. Maine apni life mein isse jyada dedicated banda nahi dekha hoga. Kai baar to ise ye bhi nahi pata hota ki last time ye soya kab tha. 3-4 din lagatar bina soye agar koi banda kaam kar sakta hai poore IIIT mein, to vo sirf Vibhav hoga. A genuine bond. Graphs mein to kabhi bhi isse baat karo, kuch alag hi level par bc karta hai. I have immense respect for him and for his dedication. Adi ka roomy tha. Jab isse baat nahi hoti thi to bahut hi strange sa character lagta tha. Main Adi ke room par jata aur knock karta. Ye thoda sa door open karke usse apna sir bahar nikalta, main poochta "Hi, Adi hai kya?" .... "Nahi hai" .... aur fir door band. Jab isse baat honi shuru hui, tab iske baare mein pata chala. I have learnt a lot from him when it comes to dedication. Adi, him and me, we used to study together during exams. sabse pehle Adi sota tha, fir main but ye fir bhi laga rehta tha. Then came the second year and we became very good friends till then. OS ke assignments batch mein bahut kam log karte the aur hum dono saath baith kar kiya karte the. I really enjoyed solving assignments with him. Then in ITWS-3, we (Adi, Chand, him and me) made a group and took a project (Beeja di Sakti <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) under Dr Sangal. That time was class. Many memories are related to that time like a nightout for just drawing a line and running to seniors for that, a night out for finding a very small bug in the project, a night-out just 1 or 2 days before the exam to integrate our project with Siva Reddy's project.<br>(Continued...)</b></i></ul><br><br>
