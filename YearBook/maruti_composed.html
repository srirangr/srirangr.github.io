<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Best of luck with Google, Go to mfking Mountain View and reach heights which you wanted to reach <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ...<br><br>Kudos to you <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Somani is THE CODER of the batch .. Has more fucking achievements than bristles in my toothbrush. We bonded quite well in 1st year, be it the RAM incident, or the virus incident, or the uncountable nightouts in workspace. When in second sem he got a laptop, Me and he used to play NFS like hell <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . That was helluva of time <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . After that in summers, we both decided to stay back, As far as I remember, He introduced me to topcoder. We used to praticse a lot in cvit lab <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, but he was more dedicated then me obviously <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .<br><br>I will still remember the way we used to threaten people for a coding challenge in the chat rooms and beat the hell out of him.  I also remmber how prasanna fkd us, and how we and prasanna became friends after that <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . Thanks to prasanna, we started spoj.<br><br>He used to give up his sleep and do spoj <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . It was difficult fr me as I was not as dedicated as he was. I still remember the FAST multiplication problem, how he used to tell me the various approaches and how I initially used to deny that his approach is not that fast. But his dedication made him solve the problem in a matter of few days, now he will do such problems in less than a minute <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . <br><br>After that, he became more dedicated towards programming. Me being less dedicated and lazy, stopped participating <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>Even then, I used to meet him nearly daily and used to pull his leg like hell <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>We have played lots of games togeter be it CS, NFS , Age etc. Har cheez mein dedication dikata hai saala <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>Google intern was a nice stay for me thanks to him. All leofying sessions on that NITW chutiya were really awesome. Checking out girls in the cafe and also checking their profiles and showing frustooness <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Those night outs with Rahul Bansal and my mentor, those outings in F-Bar, Club 8,haveli etc . <br><br>Thanks for inspiring me to code, I wouldnt have had any prog achivements without your initial push in first year. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In all my four years, I have never had a role-model, just wanted to be what I wanted to. <br><br>But today, I say as I said before. This guy is everything I want to be <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Kudos</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Well the previous testi is how Sharat would be if he would have born in the mfking detriot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Cut the crap, lets write something sensible now <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Sharat is THE CHOCOLATE BOY of IIIT. Pata nahin kitne bandiyon ka crush hai. He is also one of the most humble guys I have met in whole life. Genious is a small word to describe this guy, iski Maths esp. Geometry is totally phodu <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Though he is an EC guy, he was the part of the programming team which went to amritapuri in second year. This guy is damn creative, have never met a creative guy like him !! <br><br>We had a small stint "Alien Homies" his comics were totally ROFLMAO-maaal . Colgate pepsodent banke kya kya likha mama. He was one of my fav. bloggers ( though he blogs rarely <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) . I loved the story he wrote for his English literature course. Summary:- Jo kuch bi likhta hai totally awesome likhta hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .<br><br>Bhai sahaab, the way he laughs is totally ROFLMAO. He always gives his fav. Colgate smile when people are taking pics <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He also makes people laugh with his awesome PJs and Jokes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>He is a big foodie, he can eat anything which looks remotely edible. <br><br>The best thing I like about this guy is that he knows what his dreams are and also knows how he can achieve it. And I am damn sure he will achieve them pretty soon <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>Kuch bi rehnde, ye hyderabadi chindiya bolta. Baigan yaaroon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>All the very best for what your startup, and ya mera job pakka hai na ? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Keep in touch ( thoda door se plz <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  ) <br><br>Peace </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harshita is quite popularly known as the "Gossip Girl" of IIIT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Its very easy to make her feel happy, just say that she is looking good or that her dress is really good <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . She has totally changed her wardrobe when she came in 4th year, her brother is doing a job in hyderabad from 4th year ... coincidence ? I think not <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>She is a very talented singer, can sing any type of song. Just love her version of "Zombie" <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. Dancing bhi teek taak kar leti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>She has really reduced a lot in 4th year, kudos to your dedication to long walks and joggin <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. kash mein bi utna kar paata <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . <br><br>All in All, Harshita is a fun lovin girl, a bit childish and really cute <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Best of luck with your MS and have an amazing future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>

She used to give lots of feedback and used to suggest alternates to my dance <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> . A bit bossy, yes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But that's just because of her dedication towards vayu house <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I always used to feel guilty for not doing anything for the house. She used to approach me for participation in 1st year, but I guess she understood that I am have joined the 5th house <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .<br><br><br>Hats off to your dedication towards Vayu, enjoy your MS in US <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>Best of luck for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>She was in my discussion group, this is where I first met her. First impressions were that she was a <i>mahila mandal</i> activist, <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... lol just kidding ... I thought that she was a well mannered <i>"acchi bacchi"</i>types ... she used to speak/debate very nicely at that time . Then we met in Freshers preparation of Vayu house. We had a "nach baliye" group number. Mera to pata nahin, she danced quite well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . At that time I was very shy, I felt quite embarrassed to practice the "draupadi entrace" act in the play in front of her and Navatha <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... Kudos to you for winning so many medals for vayu <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <br><br>We were part of the same friends circle and had lots of group studying, BC'ing, walks etc. etc. One thing was quite evident that she used to strive for excellence in acads and also try to have fun at the same time. <br><br>Innumerable Achievements <i>aur </i> Sports <i>ke baarein mein aur kya hi bolun</i> baaki sab ne bol hi diya hai ... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Final impressions are that she is fun-loving person, hardworking and dedicated to her priorities in life .

<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Contd...<br><br>Though I stopped smoking in the starting of sem4, but this guy didnot <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . But we still used to meet up at times and smoke a cig or two <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . In sem4, I became serious about my studies ( as I had a fkd up GPA at that time) . This also meant that I had to be away from room. This kind of became a hurdle, and we slowly drifted away from each other . The next summer, I worked hard in CVIT and had rarely spent time with him. <br><br><br>In third year, he was the only one from the entire group to help me shift from NBH to 3rd floor OBH. I was really sick at that time, and I was happy to know that some one cared <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br><br>We rarely met after that, bt whenever we met we had loads of fun.<br><br>Now in the final semester, I am back to hanging around with this guy. Sutta bhi shuru kar diya ta maine, but stopped it about a week back <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> . I thought that I was the only one who missed his awesome company, but I was happy to know that he missed my company too <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . <br><br>Will miss him a ton, feels really bad that I have to move to bangalore now <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> . <br><br>How would you feel when you find the most irritating guy to become the most compatible room partner to one of the best friends and then drift way for a while and come back even stronger ? That is exactly what I am feeling ! And I have no words to express this feeling. <br><br>I like his company a lot, even though he loves leo-fying me a lot and I get irritated some of the times <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He has been a guruji to me for lots of things be it sutta, be it daru or anything else <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>This guy is damn lazy, extremely intelligent and a hardcore BC-enthusiast. <br><br>I can never forget :- <br><br>1.

<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Contd.. <br><br>Sem 3,<br>We became room-partners <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But this was after a lot of pangas, lots of shifting. We did hurt one or two in the process. But I was happy to be with Himank, the guy I became so close to <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . This was time I shared all my secret stories, including the bajji one <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. We became one helluva of roomies, we were compatible with each other. <br><br>I had no problems listening to what he used to play <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. It was good for me too, I didnot have the trouble to maintain a playlist <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . That is why I didnot unpack my speakers, which eventually got lost in felicity <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . He did allow me to play some eminem rap at times, but on the condition that I allow him to play Hindi-oldies which I hated the most ( I still do <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> ) . Shifting with me did create a some problems for him, the room got congested because we had two tables instead of one. Cleaning the room was an herculean task, that is why we used to do it once in a month or so <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>One incident which I will remember :- <br>We went to mehdipatnam, for shopping. Then after shopping we were standing at the bus stop waiting for the bus.<br> <br>Himank:- " Did u ever try cig ?? "<br><br>Me:- "Nopes man ! Dont wanna try either" ( i lied <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )<br><br>Himank:- "I have started smokin , my friend introduced this lovely thing to me durin summer , wanna try one ??"<br><br>Himank:-"Okies "<br><br>He gave me a lighted cig ( i didnt know how to light a cig then ) , i tried smokin and he was amazed that i didn't choke . I told him that i didnot feel anything different. To hamare, Sutta-Guru ( on the lines of luv-guru ) taught me the right way to smoke <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Sutta was just an excuse to hangout, and we did hangout a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.

<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Sem1,</b><br><b> Place </b> : NBH mess <br><b> Situation </b> : A day before C Prog. Assignment submission.<br><br>We came back from a class and having Lunch. I was happily gulping down rice and sambhar. And I heard an irritating voice coming from the seat just in front of me. I raised my head to see who it was, and I saw a chu*iya discussing solutions/doubts in the assignment with another chu*iya <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . And I thought, What the fk is this guys problem ? He looked like a g33k, another faccha who has knowledge of progg. b4 coming to IIIT. And he was kind of irritating too.<br><br><br><i> Well that was his first impression on me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </i>. <br><br>The rest of the sem, I found him in lab late in nights doing one thing or the other. Just like me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br><br><b> Sem2 </b>, <br><br>We were in the same friends group. And he was one of the first guys whom I thought I should be friends with. By now, that chu*iya/g33k image had changed, but he was still irritating <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Sem2 was the time we became close. I was kind of like his pseudo-roomie. His roomie used to be out of the room except for sleeping in the nights. And <br>the rest of time we used to listen to songs/ talk abt random things/ blog / browse .. basically do Himank's fav thing, that is BC <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . Late at nite, his roomie would come, that meant I would have to leave for my room in m*f*kng  GHEB <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . He was the first guy in our group to get a cell phone, that day was so awesome. We started taking pics of each and everything <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Each and every outing was well documented by his camera. He became a phone-addict, used to listen to songs on his erricson, used to sms to lots of people( read girls ) . I think he still holds the record for fastest-SMS writing among us. Vipul and Himank used to hang-out a lot at that time too.And thus I got introduced to Vipul thru him<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. By end of the year, we three ( me,himank and vipul ) became best buddies and kind of a mini-group in our friends group. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Contd..<br><br>She loves everything which is different. Be it spicy food or mass telugu songs, she loves to do everything hat-ke. Some incidents in her life has made her a strong social activist. Starting of by closing lights/fans in labs to helping out cash-strapped NGOs with her very own social group, Samvedana. The amount of work she has put behind Samvedana is awe-inspiring , thanks to her and others some NGOs are getting funds for helping people. <br><br>All in all she is the best-est friend one could ever have . She has been with me in many ups-and-downs in my life. The amount of care and affection I have received from her, I have never experienced so much from anyone except my family. The amount of time it takes to befriend her is very less,and before you know it you will start spilling out your beans <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br> <br> Looking at her hardworking nature and her leadership qualities, I am damn sure that she will take over the world pretty soon. To be honest, I owe her for everything I am today, Be it the google intern or the yahoo! job or the innumerable ( +ve <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )changes in myself. I couldn't think of living with you. It will be really difficult for me to go bengaluru and be away from her. It makes me want to kick myself, for not having any interaction in Intermediate or the first sem in IIIT <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> .  <br><br>I wish her all the best in her future endeavors, and wish that I could be back with her in hyderabad or she comes to bangalore pretty soon. <br><br><b>Message to her</b> :- You are awesome !

<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd... <br>We got hons. under the same prof. And plus, since we both didnot have any idea what to work on. PJN sir put us in the same project. That meant we were going to project partners till end of our B.techs. She is really hard-working, and because of her we were able to finish that awesome Charminar in about 10 days. <br><br>Sem 5 can be renamed as <b> CVIT-HELL </b> . She was very interested in the courses we took, Digital Image processing was her fav ( and it still is <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ). Because of her hard work and commitment of doing something new, she found a way to make the best Median-Filter in the world <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . At first, I thought that this was crazy and went against her ( <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> ) . But still, she worked hard and showed me the results. I was amazed at the results. We met Jayanti ma'am and she said this could be a research paper. And you know what our paper got published in ICVGIP <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .<br><br>Sem6, was very cool we went to see lots of places in and around hyderabad. <i>Itne baar</i> she asked me to bring a bike, I would say next month/sem/week and <i>talo</i>fy her request <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Then came summers, she wanted to do an MS in one of the CVIT streams and I wanted to go for a job. That is why she did an intern in Philips Bangalore and Me at Google, Hyderabad. This was a tough time for her as she was all alone in Bangalore, plus we were working on our research paper at this time. She used to spend her weekends in Office just to finish work on our research paper. And on the other hand, also used to work on her Intern.  We had some couple of fights during this time, but we used to patch-up in minutes <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . Her work in the intern was commendable, and she nearly made it to SPIE ( but couldn't because her intern came to an end <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  ). <br><br>Contd...  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd... <br>then came second semester, this was the sem I actually started interacting with her. The max interaction was when we studied for Computer Organization. I found her very friendly and helpful. Even if i used to sleep off ( which I did repeatedly ), she used to explain me everything later <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . We had lots of walks around the campus, and I found her to be coolest girl in IIIT <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .<br><br>Then came 1st year summers, I stayed back at college for a summer project ( read using-free-internet-instead-of-going-home ). She visited me once, I really didn't expect her to come given the amount of interaction we had. I still remember those awesome gulab-jamuns which she brought along with her. She makes really good gulab-jamus <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( Aur kuch nahin aata <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ) . <br><br>Then came third semester, she became one of my best friends. While the rest of college found us in study room during exams, we used to have lots of fun/BC and then try to seriously study <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Lekin BC to hoti rahti ti <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . <br><br>Sem 4, was the semester when we came very close to each other. She knew me in and out. I was so cool in front of her, I could tell her things which I couldnt tell any of my male-friends <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . This isn't the case with me alone, so many friends open up to her so easily. I feel at ease when she is around, I can be just ME in front of her. Though it is kind of irritating for her to take all that sh*t from me <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . <br><br>2nd year ke holidays mein, I had decided to apply for hons in CVIT and so did she. That summer was awesome, it made our friendship stronger and stronger. We tried out so many mess in and around indranagar. The dosas at balaji mess, the effed up Pottu ( or was it Putuu ) in kariyali, the IEG mess and of-course OBH FF . Raat mein we used to pluck raw-mangoes from the trees, work in the night and then go to IDLI-waala in Indranagar. <br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kulbir/Cool Beer/Hacker Mama/Dollar Chacha .. Kitne to naam hai iske ! <br><br>I met him in freshers preparation in vayu ( -unsubscribe ). He was a hacker mama in the funny Mahabharata play. Then after freshers, he and I had the same interests like linux etc. Me,Kulbir,Somani and Sashidhar used to do some g33ky stuff in workspace <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He was a huge KDE-fan then <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Then the next time I spent time with him was 1st year summer, Kulbir,me,somani,sashidhar,abhilash,atul and some others had decided to stay back. Kulbir searched for the best PC config at that time, I followed suit and bought the exact same system except for the wireless card and lesser ram <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Since ojasvi had moved out, I shifted my PC in his room temporarily for summer. Man we had so much fun in those days. Some students from some NIT were staying in our floor. Kulbir played some stuff on full volume, and the poor NIT ppl were making rounds in front of kulbirs room to find out what was happening <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We were rofling at them <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ! The next thing we had in common was teasing somani, Somani used to get irritated like hell <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We also took some project under Bezawada, One meeting Instant messenger becomes file sharing P2P <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> .  We were like WTF, and stopped the project. <br><br>I should be thankful to him for giving me the taste of punjabi songs. We used to play the following songs 24x7 :- <br>1. Romeo - Jazzy B <br>2. Botlan sharab di <br>3. Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui<br>4. Chadi Jawani Ankh Mastan<br><br>Most of the time we just used to look at the videos and do nothing else <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. This was also the time when he used to search for haryanvi music, which I didnt like <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .One thing peculiar about this guy was that he used to order "Paneer Chapati" everytime he used to go to canteen <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .He rarely tried something else <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>After this, we rarely met as he had become a complete g33k and was hacking his life away to glory <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Message to him: Your determination to open-source is phenomenal <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> , bt try to be a bit human too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Fav memory :- teasing somani ( from 1st ye</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br><i>Ek dum mein to pura nahin likh paunga</i> .. parts parts <i>mein likhte hain</i> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>I knew her before I came to IIIT. We were in the same JAIL ( Sri Chaitanya Narayanguda ). <i> Lekin </i>, I didn't talk to her even once ! She was the most phodu-est student in the whole narayanguda branch. Lecturers used to curse us ( i.e guys ), for getting so low marks which were of no comparison to what she was getting. I thought she was very idealistic, she used to have fun and also study at the same time. She used to sit in the corner-most seat on the last bench with her gal-pal <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . There was not a single week in which she was not 1st in the campus. That is quite an achievement ! When she used to get lesser marks, she would never cry/feel bad like other girls used to <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>In IIIT, in 1st sem I think we rarely had any interaction. One incident which I remember is during submissions of our ITWS personal websites. She said "hey, Nice work. Your website looks good". <i>Mein to</i> 0-interaction with girls <i>waala</i>, said thanks and ran off from that place <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br> I still laugh at my stupidity, and the my problem of not able to interact with girls before meeting her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <i>Agar </i> by any chance I make any GF in Bengaluru , She will be the first person I should thank to <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Baaki ek bade se break ke baad .... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I think the character he represents is Shaggy rogers from Scooby-doo series !</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I am really bad at writing testimonials. Its difficult for me to write feelings in words <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> .<br><br>Well fk it, I can still try can't I ? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>Madoo and Me have lots of things in common. First being that my first name and his surname start with "Mar" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Secondly, he is a huge formula one fan and tifosi ( ferrari-fan ) just like me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I still remember those days when we used to chat during the formula one races, and how we wanted schumi to win and wanted to stab alonso <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He also liked some kind of hip-hop like fort-minor, my only partner in singing rap/hip-hop in a group where some people thought that Eminem sings rock <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> . <br><br> When I was in TB, he was the one of the first guys I wanted to be friends with. As many have already pointed out, he is really good at managing things, he is clear with his priorities, he knows what he wants to do in life. Looking at him can sometimes inspire you to be more like him.<br><br>When it comes to relationships, he manages them quite well but has been in trouble sometimes because of too much determination in working <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br><br>I would definitely miss him <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> , as he was one of those guys with whom I had lot in common. <br><br>Note to him: Whenever you become a successful entrepreneur, do give me a job <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Prateek is everything I want to be ! I find him to be the most idealistic banda in our whole batch. As already pointed out, He definitely is a perfect gentleman. I just wish I could manage things like this dude can. <br><br> He is really witty, I used to love his blogs ( though he used to blog rarely) and now this baccha is on twitter and that witty remarks here and there make me ROFL everytime <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br> If you have Ranga and Prateek together for an outing, that outing will definitely rock ! <br><br><br>Aur Prateek-Ullah-Khan, I think I should bow out now ! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Things common between us :- Formula 1, WWE ! <br>Note to him:- Would want to know more about you in these final days ! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I really dont know anything about this guy. But I know one thing, he is the person who comes closest to a Stiffler in IIIT <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Prudhvi mama kummai ! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>All rounder hai bhai sabse bada waala all rounder. You will be amazed by the number of talents this guy has ! The best story teller in IIIT. CR to ta hi, sab ke saat BC karta ta. I still remember the non-veg Mahabharata in OBH on the night of the freshers. All the seniors were just ROFL'ing over his jokes . The helicopter going "fk-fk-fk-fk", I was like bhai kaun sonch sakta hai ye koi ! I will never forget the Greg-Pramati resort panga, where we lost our wallets but some how managed to come back to college in one piece ! <br><br>Kudos to you and your CR'giri ! <br><br>Note to him: Salsa waali ke jaise Girlfriend banale BOA mein <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>yeah! right. Sashidhar the oldest guy according to age, and the youngest according to behavior in our gangsta gang ! <br><br>He is a big fattebaz, and cracks PJs day in and day out! The best quality in this guy is that he is up for fun/raccha at any time of the day. He would come to a party even if he has a submission on the very next day ! He is very sensitive and is kind of moody. He has a huge thing for Blondes esp Scarlet Johanson. <br><br>  This guy is a huge fantasy freak, you can read his english literature story and you will understand what I mean. He is also a quizzer, loves to read pages and pages of Wikipedia and on the same time drooling over Superficial <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>   All in all a great guy to be friends with <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . He is one of the most helpful guys in IIIT ! <br><br>I just hope he gets out here very quickly and comes to bangalore to bang-'lore's <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  <br><br>Note to him :- You need to prioritize things and need to stick to them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This is the third time I am writing this testimonail .. thanks to the power cuts and 0 UPS backup <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Anyways .... <br><br><br>This guys is a huge movie buff and tech-news  freak <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ! He got addicted to his lappy in 2nd year. When we were in cellar, he used to be in his room either reading something on slashdot or watching yet another movie!. It was also the year when shriku and me were ITWS project partners. I remember the hilarios meetings which we had with our mentor <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Most of the meetings used to clash with his basketball timings, and he would come in his *famous* basketball chaddi <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>  He has never opened up to me, prolly that is because I have never spent enough time with him in 2nd year. <br><br>  A real good friend, and damn mature! Another lad who has been heating GH in his stay here <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br><br>Note to him: Apna gussa control mein rakha kar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Laxmi Bomb?? Nahin 100 ki ladi ?? ... Nahin yaar Atom Bomb ?? nahin ... Nuclear Bomb, I am unable to find a fitting comparison for ranga's energy level. He is always seen singing/dancing/jumping/ or doing raccha !  <br><br>  This guy over here is a ticket to infinite BC and enjoyment. Don't underestimate the size of ticket, This guy can do things which will just blow you off ! All he asks in return is some appreciation <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .<br><br>  I cannot name a single guy in our whole batch, who is unaware of ranga's raccha ! That speaks a lot about his friendly nature. <br><br>   My last one year has been comfortable because of this guys company . Even though his room is 2 rooms away from mine, I always knock his door rather than my two neighbors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>   The thing which many people aren't aware about this guy is that is very very intelligent and loves to do puzzles and mathematical problems. He spends days/weeks on flash games which demand intelligence ! <br><br>    This is just first round dude ! Second round pe dekh <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br><br>Note to him: Dont stop smiling ! If you do, I am gonna fking kill you !</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Chand Bhai! <br>Many trees will be cut printing your testimonials, this is because he has touched nearly everyone in our batch. <br><br>He was like a big-bro to me, advising me for literally everything and most of the times getting me out of troubles with his macho powers ( just kidding <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). I can never forget the chat I had with him when I got a F in EC and the way he gave me tips on what to talk and what not to in front of the prof. If my EC grade wouldn't have changed to D without meeting prof, I definitely would have got that D with help from chand bhai !.<br><br>He knows some secrets about me ( right from 2nd year ), and he hasn't let those secrets out to anyone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I used to look up to him in my first two years, and he was one of the reasons for change of my personality. <br><br>When I look at him now, I see a personalized friend. He kind of looks at anyone extracts all the feature vectors out of that guy, and personalizes himself according to the guy. That is the reason, you can see many people raising a hand at him whenever he is walking anywhere in IIIT ! <br><br>Note to him: Personalization can be irritating too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ! <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met this guy only few months ago! We clicked because we had similar interests, desire for having Prince biryani or eating non-veg. A mathematics and puzzle freak and is truly a genius.Apart from that he can fk any1 when it comes teasing. <br><br>At times he is very annoying, whenever this guy is around you are either laughing your ass off or getting annoyed by the comments he passes on you ! <br><br>Note for him: Good luck with the window seat in Verizon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met him, when I used to go to himanks room in second year. And instantly got fond of this guy. He was kind of the grand-ma of the cellar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , taking care of everyone, helping them out in day-to-day business etc. His clothes were shared by lots of people, including me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. As you can see he is very helpful in nature, but he can fk you when it comes to teasing ! He is one of the best traditional dancers in IIIT. <br><br>I was not able to see much of him in 3/4th year when I stopped being in the group. I could see lots of positive changes in him right now <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He has become more mature than what he used to be. And by the looks of it, I think this sentimental,caring,loving chap will do good to wonders when he comes out of IIIT ! <br><br>Message to Him : I just wish I could spend more time with you buddy ! Probably in the future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harsh or Harshu as I used to call him. Man this guy has lots of energy, he puts this energy in everything he wants or likes to do. He is brilliant, and you can see that from his grades. One of my first friends at IIIT-H, we were in the same mentor group and then we were neighbours for about an year. I just cannot forget each and every moment of my first semester, and without this guy that would not have been possible. <br><br>He is a hard-core Vayu-ite! If He wouldnt have pushed me I wouldn't have done all those dances and that draupadi thing in freshers ! <br><br>Cheers Bro!</b></i></ul><br><br>
