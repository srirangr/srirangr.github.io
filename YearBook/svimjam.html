<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>vimjam - a very coool guy .... but bit lazy as well ... i came to know him during Cricket ... a very good batsmen ... hits mostly only 4's n 6's .. i c a inzy(inzamam-ul-haq) in him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.... also this guy keeps visiting Vam's room ... so i know him a bit from that too ... pedda kasigadu .... <br>this guy is really very helpful n very innocent types ....<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>a very open hearted ... gives treats just like that.. probably gotta much money <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>keep d spirit up dude n keep rocking ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vimjam .. nuvvu racha mama...<br><br>Looks like an uncle <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> with his big tummy and walking style and all but actually is a very innocent chap who loves to play cricket and talk about politics.<br><br>Its very easy to make a fool out of him. He never gives a damn whatever you say to him. Does a lot of <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> things and most of them are because of his innocent nature. He is a very humble and down-to-earth guy. But sometimes if you keep pulling his leg for a long time, he gets all angry. Dude, I've something to tell you. I like it when you're all angry <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but I don't have the courage to pull your leg when you are angry coz I'm afraid of the aftermath.<br><br>These days he's reading 3 newspapers a day and creating all nuisance on the floor by telling each and everyone whats happening. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Its good that you read more but please don't eat others' brains <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Coming to the main point. <b>Cricket. </b>Vimjam is one of the most powerful batsmans of our team. He cam beat the crap out of any bowler. He's hit the longest 6 I've seen till date. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Mostly gives (out)standing performances coz sometimes running with a huge belly can be big problem, you see. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. That was about batting. Now lets move to fielding. This guy rarely tries to catch the hold of the ball when somebody hits a ground shot. Coz he can;t bend. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And its fun to leofy him on that point <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>Now Mr. Vimjam is a professor in LPU. And I'm very happy for that. Btw, we also designed 3 Golden rules of Vimjam <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> which I'm not disclosing here. Incase anyone wants to know about them, please ping me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I'll tell you them in person <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future raa ... keep rocking<br><br>Srirang. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>vimjam,<br><br>innocent, good, simple and childish <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>a lazy guy and good one to be with. Goes home regularly (i mean he stays more at home than in college). Has good cricketing skills but again his laziness killed them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Gets angry instantaneously, control it buddy.<br><br>all the very best for ur future,<br>stay in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers,<br>rohit</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is the one I spent most of my time with in here, we come from same college but didn't really<br> know him then as I do now. I didn't came across a more benevolent person than him, he is the one <br>I go to when I need  any help, he is there for u anytime. He is kind at heart, unselfish I can say. <br>I don't know how many times I made fun of him but everytime he receives it with a  simle or ends <br>up with puching me and then apologises. okay let me think of any daily routines  he does ...yes here he goes <br>1. he changes his mind in a matter of few seconds <br>2. Reads newspapers and points out mistakes in them.<br>3. tries very hard to run but his Airbag doesn't allow him to do so... not even bending <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>4. This is the most important one ...he showers his pearls of wisdom he acquired on that day to everyone in his feild of view, <br>note : by everyone I also mean complete strangers<br><br>One more thing I admire him of is his bating, he is known across our batch for hitting sixes although spends little time at crease. <br>He is scared of water, when asked for the reason he responded with somebody told him that he has a "Jalagandam". <br>I share lot of funny experiences with him, I couldn't forget the scene when I told him abt the networking in a dual core pc and also when we(me and vam) <br>narrated him the Apple theory in first year<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Last but not least he is great fan of our dear Balayababu.. dude u rock!<br><br>finally a note for everyone : If u ever have any confusion in deciding which restaurant to dine, just call him he will bless u with all the details u need <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br> <br>note for him : I wish you have success in ur career and take care of your health properly. cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is my classmate since higher secondary <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Very decent and a nice guy. As some one mentioned earlier... yeah I too agree that he'll become a gud Prof <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>All da best dude!!<br>Have a wonderful life ahead!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>There are very few people in our college who have the habit of reading Economic Times daily exhaustively without even leaving the advertisements! There are even fewer people who can read articles on Economics and Recession/Global-slowdown from webpages that even Google fails to crawl <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. There is even a subset of people among them who tries to apply all the knowledge thus acquired on real life situations and to teach others. Needless to say, our Vimjam is one among that subset of people. And thankfully, he's the only one. It is no-brainer that he rightfully got a Professor job.<br><br>All the time, you either find him bragging about his hometown Narsaraopet or sharing his newly acquired knowledge with friends and strangers alike which he thinks they aren't aware of (but the actual truth is he's the last person to get to know!<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ).<br><br>Now-a-days, making promises and going back on one's word has become a fashion. Our Vimjam has already caught up in with it. Another talent that he, and only he, possess is to crack a joke just to find out that he's the only person laughing (or appear to be!).<br><br>And in spite of all these, Vimjam remains one of the best friends of mine whom I can share any secrets with and at the same time being a comedian who makes fun of himself to make others laugh.</b></i></ul><br><br>
