<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My GHEB ka padosi in 1st year. We are a hi hello friend. We've had some good conversations on dinner table or in corridors of hostel. He's quite a smart and handsome guy and being a delhite reflects in him! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Quite a jovial and pleasant person.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br>This guy has beared with me for so long. I wouldn't done that myself for a guy like me. Nobody would suspect him of having got into so much trouble as he has in college, and many a times I think the fault has been mine. Many a times I just drift apart and keep doing random stuff on my own. I'm sure there are several more chutiyaapa I have done, and still whenever I go back, this guy is still there for me. Thanks for all the support and friendship over the years dude. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Speaking of him as a person, he's a complete Aalsi. Evidence of which can be seen in his comeplete ruckus of a room, his strangely functioning laptop and the numeous unread books in his room. He is one guy who I think can give competition to me in that department. But still, he optimises on whatever capacity of hard work he has and the results have been quite impressive too. <br><br>He's someone with a complete peace of mind. Whether it be a DISCO, or the 60-bottle kaand, or CAT or placements, he stayed cool. I think he can easily give competition to a Himalayan Yogi in that department. I can bet that he was one guy with the least amount of preparation for the placements. I'm sure it was his cool, calm and self-sassured attitude more than anything which got him a great placement. You don't know it, but I was really worried at one point of time how you will get placed... but turned out he was only the second person from ECE as well as our wing to get placed, and I had to wait for several days after him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>In the first meeting, he looks exactly like the typical stereotype of Delhi guys that people carry with them. But he's exactly opposite to that. He's aalsi, never touched alcohol, doesn't even use fowl words (atleast none of the hindi ones, still <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and stays quiet and content. <br><br>Person you resemble: Ranvijay of the MTV Roadies<br>Fav memories: The support shown after the Daru Kaand<br>In ten years I see you as: HR Director of a big-shot company, the nice guy of the office.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><br>Date: 20-25 July, 2005 (Fuck! it's been four years!)<br>Place: Some room in OBH<br><br>I was relishing a sutta offered to me by Alankar and gang, when enters this guy who was dressed as if for a party. They order him ,'abey DPS, Pankhe ko gaali de.'<br>The party dude, 'motherfucker, asshole...'<br>Gang, 'abey C****, *****, ****** desi wali gaaliyaan de'<br>The dude, 'Sir, main hindi mein gaaliyan nahi deta'.<br><br>I (thinking): 'kya chutiya hai yaar ye banda...'<br><br>Turned out that Narang and I lived in the same hostel. Uske baad toh saath mein itni ragging di, ki bas. And tab se saath hi hain. The only guy who was in the same hostel with me for all the four years, and through all the ups and downs (and God knows there have been quite a few!) of these four years of my college life.<br><br>The memories are just too many to be listed here. In fact, I can see all the four years of my college life, how we kept acquiring new friends. Ranjeet came first, then Saraswat, Jain, the and others and alowly our group formed to what it is now. The 'sair' after dinner around GHEB in the first sem, watching movies together on my lappy, those movie and dinner outings, when we didn't used to do any hisaab whatsoever of our combined expenses. Second year, life in NBH, and the ragging scandal and the tiff with the guards. All the awesome masti of the second year, in the 240s wing when Ganges used to live with us. Then scuffle and its aftermath. Then shifting to third year, OBH, me drifting apart for a while only to see a more thicker friendship even after the Farewell fiasco. And the preparing for CAT, and then placements together, and finally the total lukkha days of the 8th sem. It's been a complete roller coaster ride for me. Things have come and gone, but Narang has always stayed by my side.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I was discussing with Himank and Khatri on which character represented Narang the best. We unanimously agreed on some of the things he is - refined, balanced and sophisticated. And that was when we came up with the personality which comes towards the end of the testimonial <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Well, not many would differ on what Narang is. Through my interactions, I have also found him to be a very reasonable person who uses logic to get out of any quandary. Though lazy, he is passionate about a few things. Sports, for one. I'll take back all the discussions we've had on cricket, football, F1 as well as tennis. We never discussed wrestling though, I'm not into it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . But he has a good knowledge base in all of these sports. The other, would be CAT and management. I really hope that the results tomorrow are favorable for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I've enjoyed all the discussions we've had. Being in adjacent wings and having certain common interests has helped. We managed to get placed in the same company as well, though I'm sure you'll not have to join it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And ahh.. We'r both among the 'rare ones' who've attended a DISCO in IIIT <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Can't forget that day as well.. While collecting the letter from BLN, I was in tears, but he stayed composed and balanced. Other memory with him.. Meeting him on the first day in IIIT through the same mentor group. Remember that both of us were asked to propose Arpita Sharma <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . He also put in good work in Felicity '08.. He has some very good ideas in the lit domain. <br><br>May God bless! May ManU remain the best!<br><br><b>Character he represents: Akshay Khanna in DCH.<br>Fav memory: CL's bootcamp.<br>Message for him: Get rid of the laziness you have <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
