<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harshita is quite popularly known as the "Gossip Girl" of IIIT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Its very easy to make her feel happy, just say that she is looking good or that her dress is really good <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . She has totally changed her wardrobe when she came in 4th year, her brother is doing a job in hyderabad from 4th year ... coincidence ?

<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harshi.. The first word that strikes my mind when I hear this girl's name is "a gifted singer" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is hyperactive, very funny <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and pretty cool.She is always full of energy and does things with great enthusiasm.She is into everything she thinks she can give a try.Dancing, Singing, Carrom, Badminton, and the latest, Throwball and TT too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Be it anything, she just gives her 100%.<br><br>We have been together in many activities at IIIT. It started with Felicity'06 Dance <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We can never forget that experience..The way we danced, the way we looked <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And then the "Chinnamma Chilakamma" performance which we dedicate to our beloved professor Dr.Govindarajulu. And then the Felicity'07. I can never ever forget her sacrifice then.. She dropped out from the dance after some 20-25days of vigorous practice just for me <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> as there were not enough guys to perform then. thanks a lot Harshi <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> I somehow din't perform in Felicity'08 as I was busy with other dances but I liked her dance alot <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Last but not the least, the morning jog <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> She is more regular than me when it comes to jogging. And I feel more happy if it is a day when both of us jog together <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And then comes the latest tournaments which we have together participated in. Throwball at Narayanamma, Badminton at ICFAI and what not!! She is one of the two girls from my batch, the other being Lydia who accompanied me in most of the activities at IIIT and I loved her company <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>One has to appreciate her dedication in following a strict diet, regular excercising and losing lots of weight within a very short period.. And now you can see her in smiles all the time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She has this habit of buying lots of new clothes and making others jealous <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Ya, I too buy lots of them, but she does it very often. Her lifestyle<br>changed quite a bit since her bro started staying at Hyd. You owe it all to your brother Harshi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>This might not end..<br><br>I wish you all the very best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and yeah. I'll be waiting for the wedding invitation harshi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Will Miss U <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  Lot of luv <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I don't remember where I met her first time... it could be the workspace, our English class or lab session as we both were in B1... however she talked to me first. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> that day and yesterday at the coffee shop, she looked at me with the same feeling of curiosity in her eyes...<br>I enjoyed all her solo singing performance, she has this melody in her voice that any song she sings becomes pleasant... I particularly remember the 'Zombie' song, sometimes called as IIIT-H's favorite song <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , which she sung on the Rock show night...</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part I<br><br>Harshi and Me, we were more or less an acquaintance in first two years. But after four years, she is one of my closest buddy. For the first two years I remember her as a good singer, extremely kiddish. I have seen her and Harsh fighting like kids. I knew she never thought much before speaking, she would say something which would prompt me to nudge her. Third year, Ma'am would fight like cats and dogs over house points, complain that juniors are not working, complain for asking her to sing every time. In fourth year, she had a sudden realization that she needs to reduce weight and that was the time when we started walking and talking together. She is a gossip queen, I have no idea why she is so much bothered about what is happening with others. She just needs a small twick and the next moment you can find her pestering you to tell her what happened. She would not leave you until you tell her the whole story. She is damn gregarious, she would talk to anyone in the campus. At times, she has got into trouble because of her "ohh! everyone is my friend" nature. For the people, she is extremely talented, phodu singer, good in dancing, awesome mimic, damn she can mimic my laughing style!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>Aah! suprisingly sometimes, she is good at giving advices. I must admit she is by far the best singer I have come across. Still remember me<br>cheering her during her Oktober flakes performance. She was simply awesome when she sung "Animal Instinct". I love when she gets angry after she finds out that I smoked, though trust me I have reduced. Our chat begins with a standard question "aaj kitne ciggs piye?". She likes to be pampered. Our most of the interactions consists of me scolding her over any damn thing. She has gone through such a metamorphosis; Ma'am has improved her dressing sense, ab patli bhi ho gayi hain. Though, she can get on your nerves asking you repeatedly "How am I looking?".This poor soul has been victim of many of my random philosophical discussions. I am going to miss all the long walks we had, its hard to be in bad mood when she is with you because she is always upto something, uses me as a punching bag. And when I say long walks I really mean it, she never gets tired and if I tell her to sit somewhere she is like "No, I did not go for jogging today!" The best part is she is not a complicated person, she is quite open about her opinion about people, she will let you know if she is angry and it doesn't take much to cheer her up "ek do senti dialogues" will do, she is "exorbitantly" caring, needs an update of everything I am upto. I have spent some really memorable moments with her.<br><br>Some Memories, your arbit PJs,"Bada banda hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />", our discussions on some weirdest topics, your irritating tantrums, your independence day<br>performance, "the great pav bhaji treat", all my funda sessions and unending walks. <br>Harshi, you have been a great friend,enjoyed every moment spent with you and I know you will always be there for me, same caring and cute Harshi.<br>Jaldi se MS complete kar lena...<br>Cheers!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harshita -- She is a very dedicated and hard-working and a bit childlike girl.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> She has a very sweet voice too.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> She has worked a lot to reduce her weight. Kudos to her for that.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> She must have inspired most of the girls here at IIIT-H.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> And even I tried to know, how was she able to do that.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And she replied with a wide smile on her face - "I restrained myself to eat pizza and other fast foods."<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The above secret made such an impact on me that even I also stopped eating pizzas. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>She is a fun loving girl and don't hesitate speaking to anyone (either female or male <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>I used to enjoy a lot the fight between her and her class neighbor - Mohit Goyal. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>Aur jab woh Mohit se jyada gussa ho jaati thi<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> .. to use kehti hai -- "Ek Ghunsa Maarungi tere ko!!".<br>I can't imagine ki woh ghunsa khakar mohit goyal prithvi par hi rehta ya kahin Mars pe pahunch jaata. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Waise Mohit ka reply bhi awesome hota tha "jab bhi mere ko Ganganagar(his home town) jaana hoga tab main tere ko bata doonga aur tab utna hi tez ghunsa maariyo taaki main Ganganagar mein girun" <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>I have just only specified one of the best fights they had. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>It was a great fun sitting with both of you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>At the end, I wish you achieve whatever you aim in your life.<br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>      Harshita by far is the most famous girl of our batch..Wait, did I say our batch, no no, I  meant the whole college. Thats right! A well acclaimed sweet voice that she has got along with an equally sweet heart, add to it her real good dancing skills and her mindblowing talent of imitating others, she is a complete package of entertainment <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>       It is always fun having her around and pulling others' legs together. She is sensitive but at times can give you a piece of her mind if you manage to piss her off <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> A complete shopoholic and is probably the only girl other than myself who enjoys rock music. She gets her crushlist updated very regularly <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but there has only been an increase in the number of people who are fond of her!<br><br>     From nightouts for exams to playing dumb-c till 4 in the morning, to freaking you out with my injury quite frequently <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , it has been an amazing journey of four years. I wish we all stay in touch throughout. You know I love you and I will always be 'there' for you <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harshita aka Moti will definitely be one of the most bubbliest and lively girl you can find. She always has something to say and that too something funny that will leave you only smiling. She was quite fatty during the initial years but I must say she has worked a lot and changed a lot during the last one year.<br><br>I know her right from the first year as we both shared the same section. I remember we used to make fun of her but I hope she never mined it because its all part of college life <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I deeply regret for an incident which happened during DBMS class in 4th sem. I made her cry and that was because of one of the silliest thing I have done in college. I'm extremely sorry for that. That day I felt she'll never talk to me again but thank god she forgave me and didn't take it seriously.<br><br>A damn good singer and an equally good dancer. Once you see her dancing and singing, you'll instantly fall in love with her talents. Her "zombie" will always be remembered as a song which tortured us for a longgggg time <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. During any singing competition, her name will definitely be there among the first two winners. I always feel she should try her hand at singing professionally and I will never be amazed if one day she'll be singing for some film or album.<br><br>She is childish to the core (or thats what she shows) and always do or say something silly. She has this habit of reading messages from boys mobiles and then reacting wierdly like she has read something **** and this has not happenned once <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Come on ... what else do you expect from a guyz mobile <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>She is the most talkitive girl in the batch and you can find him talking to the entire college it seems. A very rare quality found in girls. It's always fun to have her around. <br><br>Try not to change yourself and be the same as you are because you are toooo good.<br><br>Good luck for your MS. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Harshita aka Harshi aka Moti</u><br><br>Cute, bubbly, vivacious are some of the adjectives that define this girl. She is the only girl in the batch who talks to each and everybody. Be it batchmates, juniors, seniors she is always ready to do BC with all and sundry. I have shared a lot of pleasant memories with her courtesy Prithvi house, we have been together a few times in organising and preparing things, its been a pleasure working with her. She has been a champion when it comes to the cause of Prithvi house, the no of points she has collected.<br><br>Will always remember you as the biggest BC baaz among the girls.<br>Wishing you all the best for your future and hoping that you complete your MS soon. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harshita, I like to call her 'Moti' (easiest way to irritate her <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) as she is always worried about that ... does exercise, goes for a long walk day and night <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but when it comes to the food ... she never leaves anything <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. I hv seen her sitting in the mess for a long time <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>When it comes to talking then I think ..no one can beat her in talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. When you are with her, you don't have to worry about what to talk and what not to <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. she will take care of that. You can talk about anything with her. I have met only a few girls who are very open minded and she falls in that category <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I am a fan of such kind of open mindedness <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> so its always fun talking to her.<br><br>She is one of the few enthusiastic girls in our batch <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ... she sings and dances very well, she has hardly lost any singing competition. She gets very senti when someone says anything about her voice.<br><br>Her cool, friendly and childish attitude makes her outstanding <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Always be like that and keep talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>Best of Luck for ur future ... hope u get ur MS in 5 years <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Keep up the hard work in terms of Exercises ... I am sure .. ek din tum mere se bhi 'patli' ho jao gi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>contd...<br><br>In first year, she used to sit right in front of me. It was so hilarious to see the stuff she used to do. She used to poke sainani when he was asleep, sometimes mimic the prof., or mostly engage in faltoo, timepass conversation. In workspace, she had her computer right behind me. Her computer was a big dabba and I was her trusted technical support. Though this connection was lost in the subsequent years, we still got/get to have those arbit, faltoo, timepass discussions. In these four years, I've learnt a lot of stuff from her but the one thing that stands out is her ideas of friendship. I remember that once in first year, she told me how she felt bad about dividing the sections into two because a lot of her friends were in the other section and she was missing out on a lot of fun. A sentiment I could not really relate to properly until the beginning of second year. That's when I realized how close she is to her friends and how she actively seeks their company.<br><br>In the end I should say that in these four years I've come to know tons of stuff about her and I'm sure I'll get to know a lot more. When decided on a goal to achieve, she has it in her to put umpteen dedication to make it happen and with that spirit here's me wishing that she meets success and gets what she wants. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>sashidhar</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I often see Harshita calling a guy or gal cute, with the number of people she calls cute tending to infinity. If you ask me, I'll say that most of them are not even half as cute as her. I still don't understand why she abondoned her cuteharshi email id. Of all the people I've known for sometime, the "child in her" is the most pronounced. Whether it is doing awesome mimicry (do you know she does very good mimicry of me and sharat), or asking the kind of wierd doubts children generally ask in that please-tell-me-too tone. She's very curious about the stuff around her and tries to get to the bottom of it. On top of all this she sings and dances pretty well. It's so awesome to watch either of these two as the amount of energy she puts in both these activites is really out of this world, yet making it look so effortless.<br><br>Too bad Oxford and Cambridge don't know who harshita is. If they had known, their definition of extrovert would most probably have been what harshita is. She is so full of energy when around people. She is extremely outgoing. After all you see she was the Ms. Fresher of our batch. But the mindboggling thing is how many people she knows. In harshita's case, she can go to a group of people and effortlessly join their discussion, something I'm sure I can never do. This awesome quality of hers plus the afore mentioned quality of getting to the bottom of the matter at any cost often helps her in getting the inside scoop as far gossip is concerned. But the bad part is that if she knows it, entire GH will probably know it by the end of the day. I've often said this and I still stick to it that telling something to harshita is like knocking every single door in GH and telling it.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Shes also the biggest well wisher for her friends.<br><br>I also remember the really long walks we had. She loves gossip, and I enjoyed those sessions with her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its so easy to leofy her, just tell her that you know something that she doesnt <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And then you have to look at her reaction <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Those walks also had me seeing her other side, where we often spoke about personal issues. I also remember the MacD treat <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Third year saw her putting in her best for Felicity. Ahh.. And how come I didn't mention it as yet? Shes a fab singer. You've got to give the ears when shes in the flow! She is now in the college rock band.. Quite a journey its been from the salwar-wearing-ms-fresher to the babe-in-the-rock-band. Shes also a very good dancer, classical as well as western. In fact, she has a pretty good dressing sense right now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All in all, Harshita's the kind of girl who is simple, not too complicated. She tries to look at the world through a very bright x-ray. Shes a kid at heart, though she may not accept it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But yes, I'd say that its now the time for her to grow up and adjust herself accordingly (Though I'll urge her not to change her basic nature).

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>Harshita. One name which brings smiles to the faces of many of us <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> That should say a lot about her. In fact, the word which'd perfectly go with her is "bubbly". Shes as chirpy and bubbly as one can get <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> That comes with being very friendly with most people, in fact a little over friendly sometimes. The thing is that she cannot always draw the line, something which can land her into trouble. She needs to learn that quickly, after all its gonna be the corporate world (hopefully) for her soon. But well, its also the quality which makes her one of the most popular people on campus. Her friends cut across people from all batches, and Harshita M'am is a very popular phrase <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its that thing about her which always keeps the mood alive when you'r with her. Shes one person with who its very difficult to feel uncomfortable with!<br><br>Being a pretty young lady, she loves flaunting it <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She loves compliments, she absolutely dotes on people giving her so. Its very easy to cheer her up, just pay her compliments on looks and how shes grown thin <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ahh.. thin, shes really worked in order to get into shape. Fat foods out, exercising, gymming.. Hats off to you for that buddy <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Am pretty sure you'll be in the perfect shape one day <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> And get that perfect guy as well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I remember that we hardly spoke to each other in the first year. It was only in the second semester that we started interacting. I remember her as a fat and chubby girl from then who could never stop speaking. Of course, shes changed a lot. Well, back then I remember leofying her in front of a lot of people in workspace and she was damn pissed! Anyways, it was through her that I had a sort-of-girl-who-I-briefly-dated <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> That was when we started interacting a lot. In fact, I fondly recollect those third sem days. She stood by me during the ragging-disco case, she came and told me that everyone did. Back then, I was touched.
