<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is one of the first people I met after joining IIIT. We had good time together in 1st semester <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but then slowly drifted away, for no reason<br>whatsoever! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I think he's the one who gave me the nick Scientist. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Quite a self-composed guy and a good friend.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br>Jain ke aur mere interest bahut kam hi milte the. Gaming, CVIT, veg food, choice of courses, social life, har front pe interests different the. Main wing mein raha bhi kam. Phir bhi dosti ki feeling kam nahi hui, full credits goes to him for dealing with a lousy fuck like me. Many times I felt that I'm not being good to him. I sincerely regret if I ever came across as such. You've always been there for me, and will always be one person I can always count on. <br><br>Can never forget the time we spent together.<br><br><b>10 years down the line I see you as:</b> Running your own financial enterprise. <br><b>Memory:/b> Jab tu faltu mein guard wale case mein fas gaya tha, and then scuffle case se tujhe nikaal liya tha, Haraam ki Baggi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><b>Tags:</b> Group, wing.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Jain and I go a long way back.</b> Back when GHEB was GHEB, and not a part of GH. We would study together at the last moment for the first semester exams, and he would always get more marks than me. Times changed, but we remained together, through people, groups, wings and hostels. Jain has always been there for me, without once complaining.<br><br>About him, he's a total BOND. Problem solving comes naturally to him. I was amazed at the way it did the first time we discussed a problem. And it has been so ever since. Jain, despite the kind of totally freaked out lifestyle we lead, still has a good CG and knows a lot of things. Doing MS under Jaws, by choice. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Halaanki mauka miley toh aaj hi Jaws ko finger dikha ke bhaag jaaye <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Jain kai maamlon mein wing ki jaan raha hai. Jab bhi kabhi khud ne padh lia to sabko bataaya zaroor hai. Ye baat aur hai ki padha khud last moment pe hi. Gaming, movies etc mein poora poora sath. Saath mein khoob movies, outings ki hain. Baahar walo ke liye Jain mystery bana raha, but we all know about his ideas. I never cease to be surprised that someone hailing from such a totally business family is keen on studying so much. Speaks volumes about the family. Hum Jain ko chidhaate rahe kanjoos bol bol ke, but actually he has never failed to help anyone jab bhi zaroorat padi ho kisi ko paise ki. Haan, khaane ke maamle mein thoda kanjoos zaroor hai. Room mein rakhta hai samaan, aur hamesha apne haath se hi deta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Jain sahab .. hamare ..the player .. bhai sahab CS and AOE mein fodu hai .. suru suru mein hum log best buddy the ..baad mein ye .. OBH moved kar gaya .. apan jab kabhi milte hai.. mast baat karte hai ... <br><br>Awesome banda hai .. lage raho dude .. <br>Baaki kya hi likhun tum samajhdaar ho <br>Dimaag hai bande mein .. smart hai ... intelligent hai ... thoda kam bolta hai ... lekin kaam jyada karta hai .. <br><br>Hope ki tu apni MS complete kar le .. !! <br><br>Ab time hai ..4:39 isliye mai jyada nahi likhunga .. tu padhega ke nahi ye bhi nahi pata ... </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Rahul Jain. I first remember him as the guy from Gwalior who hardly spoke anything <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Well, he is like that.. Introvert and takes a lot of time to open up. <br><br>A co Manchester United fan, he is also famous as one of the RJ brothers. The researchers, the bonds <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I really hope that you get your MS degree in time.. Nahi to RJ ke saath sadna <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I also remember Jain for the fact that he keeps running back home at every given opportunity. He also plays cricket, and is a decent line and length bowler. And his wingmates tell me something for which I've put the character for him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best in life!<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Uncle Scrooge <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: The fateful ragging incident.<br>Message for him: Kuch to bolo <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
