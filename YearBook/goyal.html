<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Awesome comedy karta hai. Humesha hasta dekha hai maine isse. He was my wingmate for three years. He made our whole wing lively. you will never feel bored in his company. The way he speaks is unique and can make anybody laugh with it. I have also seen him serious couple of times considering his MS.<br><br>First year mai koi bhi assignment ho ta tha aur mere paas aata tha kahin se jugad ne ke liye. aur midsems mai iske paas.<br><br>In second year I made him start AGE. He got so crazy about this game that whole summers he spent playing AGE. He picked up the game so fast that in sometime he started defeating me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Mohit kaho maglu kaho has its peculiar style of doing things. I am impressed jis tarah se ye apni marwaleta hai aur usmai bhi khush rehta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Maglu be the same but now its time you develop your personality too and talk as matured one, your talking style should reflect the new maglu, childhood days are gone. This is the just the advice. <br><br>I am happy to be placed in a city where you are there for atleast a year. bas ek baar offer letter aajaye <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>best of luck for your future in MS.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

It really took nearly 1 1/2 hour to understand what mistake he did <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Banda I year mei footbal khelta tha.

And then dedicates his soul for it.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> In most of the cases, he has achieved whatever he has aimed.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>He has been my room partner for first two years of our college life. And due to that, I am aware of some of his bad qualities as well.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> A few are: -<br><ol><br><li>Banda subah bhi light jalakar padhta hai<img src=Smileys/26.gif /></li><br><li>Apna kamra kam hi clean rakhta hai<img src=Smileys/2.gif /></li><br><li>Pehle roj nahin nahata tha.. but shayad aaj kal roj nahata hai</li><br><li>Jitna khana plate mein lekar aata hai..utna to kabhi nahin khata..humesha jhootha chhodta hai<img src=Smileys/14.gif /></li><br></ol><br>Arey iska matlab yeh nahin ki isme achchaiyan nahin hain .. iski achhaiyan to anginat(infinite) hain .. aur utni main likh nahin sakta ..lekin kuch to main yahan likh hi deta hun ..<br><ol><br><li>Kabhi bhi kisi ko padhane se mana nahin karta<img src=Smileys/77.gif /></li><br><li>Kuch bhi activity karta hai.. to poore dedication se<img src=Smileys/41.gif />.. nahin to nahin karta</li><br><li>TT achcha khelta hai.. samne waala khud hi haar maan leta hai..iske returns se pareshan hokar<img src=Smileys/3.gif /></li><br><li>Banda apne Confidence ke balboote par apne opponent ki faade rakhta hai.. bt sometimes woh confidence thoda over ho jaata hai<img src=Smileys/21.gif /></li><br><li>Python par kaafi achchi command hai<img src=Smileys/4.gif /></li> <br></ol><br>There are many other qualities in him and that you have to find out after being his friend.<br>Aaj kal yeh kisi bandi ke peeche hai.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>I wish ki ise woh ladki mil jaaye..<br>Wish you a great future ahead!!<br>Be my friend forever.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Maglu and his Magli have always been a famous topic of discussion. His laughing style is just awesome. You see him alughing and you'll not be able to control yourself laughing. He is a die hard Australian cricket team fan and its been a favourite pastime of many of us to leofy him for the same. He keeps on arguing about the Australians and always gets raped by the others for suppoting them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>He had the courage to propose a girl in the first year and even though she refused, he never let that stop him and kept on as nothing happened. He was among my very first friends and I always loved leofying him.<br><br>He is very good at studies and strongly sticks to his point. Its very difficult to change his mindset. He is very hard working and is working his ass off compete his MS in due time. He has been a messcom and people have leofyed him  alot for that too. Whenener the food was not good, he was the one who got cursed by almost everyone.<br><br>I'll cherish so many of the moments spent with him and the outings with him in the first years. A very good friend indeed.<br><br>Loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> God bless you and Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Mohit aka Maglu</u><br><br>One of the most awesome guys of the batch. Whenever you see him, he would always have a smile on his face. One of the earliest friends of mine, started talking as we both were in Section-B. Its always so much fun hanging around with him. There are quite some things about him which make him so adorable and memorable, his funny accent, the way he could never learn to pronounce the <b>"au"</b> sound. I still remember how I used to make him speak <b>aur</b> back in first year and he would never be able to speak it out. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Of late he has been a majour source of entertainment in mess, coz of his love for Australian cricket team. Even in matches involving India and Australia, he would always support them, which has led to many a stories and a lot of leofying of him in the mess. More often than not Maroo & me would be the main culprit when it came to pulling his leg, all the stories involving him & Ponting, Hayden, Symonds <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> will always remember this BC. But the guy never ever minded anything we said, he would always be smiling his famous laughter. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>In the end would like to tender an apology if I ever hurt you :|<br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>An advice: Learn how to speak "aur" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b><br><br>Cheers!!

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Maglu.. My favourite memories of him have come on the dining table. Everyday, Himank and I would be on the lookout for Maglu. As soon as he comes, we start leofying him about his support for Australia.. How he .. you know what.. to Symonds and Ponting <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . It is amazing to see that he always retorts back, but all with a smile. He is still that hard core fan, though Himank and I have somewhat dented his confidence about the Kangaroos.<br><br>Apart from that, hes a sweet little chap with a hilarious way of talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . The way he narrates things is awesome. He is also very dedicated to his work, I'm sure he'll get his MS degree soon. And yeah.. Hes crazy after Miss. X, now I'm sure everyone knows about it and his rendezvous in the workspace <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: He praising me in first year, thanks for it man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Message for him: Why the obsession with the Aussies <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mohit, Maglu , Magli ka pati <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, esagu ka manager .... got to know him during the course WDKM . Hamesha course ke samay sincerity se padta tha aur fir exam ke samay humein pda deta tha <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Playing AOE with him and daddu is extreme fun, the comments he makes is just awesome. He has special way of talking, hilta rehta hain , hasta rehta hain, aankhen band ho jaati hain , aur aawaz bhi ajeeb hain. I really enjoy when you say "abe roku","yeh toh rape ho rha hain" and many of your one liner which you use here and there. He is bold and straight  forward. Jisko jo bolna hain, bolna hain <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Uske face mein bol deta hain sab kuch. Another characteristic of him is his "I ROCK"  attitude <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Kuch bhi ho jaaye he never agrees that he has done anything wrong, ya fir uska katta hain , ya fir saamne wala usse zyaada achcha hain (spl. his MS buddy <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Even though koi kitni bhi mra le its hard to change his opinion. Example for this is the fact that Australia sucks, still he supports them <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>He is from some <i> gaon</i> called Sri Ganganagar City <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and always boasts about how the place is, how its in pakistan <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and how much task force is on every nook and corner there. Mess mein BC karne mein khub mazza aata hain, he was our mess com in 3rd year, bahut maarte the iski sabhi because of bad food, he worked hard for improving the condition but kuch ho nahin ska <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ladkiyon ke mamle mein pehle sidha-sadha bachcha tha, agar koi pasand aa jaaye toh school change kar leta tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but aajkal toh ekdum chipak hi jaata hain , bhale ladkiyan kitni bhi laat marein <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>In 4th year,He can be always found in my wing, kuch <b>dullapanti</b> bhi kar liya karo. eSagu mein toh yeh hero (or u can say c*) hain.

<b><a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Maglu... one of the most popular 'dulla' of our batch <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Is a great guy to be with. A hard core fan of the Australian Cricket team who still believes they're the no. 1 side <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (I share the same sentiment <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. We have had a blast of a time all these years doing lots and lots of BC, imitating Kabra's voice and with plenty of eSagu v/s LTRC bickering. eSagu's real researcher and its go-to guy (eSagu is run by Maglu ... or so he says <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). If anyone does research at eSagu it is none other than him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. (Join LTRC dude <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Apart from the obvious research talent, he's pretty smart and intelligent <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. (Doesn't have an F in his 'kundali' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). This guy is mad about girls but unfortunately has no girlfriend(s), hence christened 'tharkee' <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Perhaps the only person who doesn't remember the name of the hero of a movie after watching it. <br>Dreams about dating Elisha Cuthbert, Katrina, Hilary Duff and others in his never ending list. <br><br>He is someone who never backs out and is always ready for a fight. No matter what, does not budge in any situation. Try saying something about his native place (Sri) Ganganagar and pat comes the reply. Poor guy, has to contend with the whole batch whenever Australia loses (which is happening  more often than not these days, much to his dislike). <br><br>All in all, a fab person with never a dull moment in his life (research, girls, Australia et al <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) with a great sense of humor.<br>All the best pal for your future. Hope you finish your MS next year (with publications <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and crack CAT and also intern and work at Microsoft (Redmond)<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is one of the few people I didn't like at first, but slowly I learnt, and others would agree with me, that he's a great guy... banda heera hai heera.<br>But I still can't ignore the reason I disliked him for initially, though the effect has reduced considerably.<br>Anyways, he has a very short reaction time to anything he does, that includes chatting. He is very helpful and if his project partners are such that they won't work (I happened to be such a project partner once!), he does all the work! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He is helpful in general as well and helps others in their projects.<br>He loves python (not the reptile though) and Elisha Cuthbert and Hilary Duff and Britney Spears and Wrestling (the American one) and Australian Cricket Team. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>The long BC (Baat Cheet) with him in which he told me about stories of his life before joining IIIT, and some after joining IIIT which I didn't know, was really good.<br>He proudly talks about Sri Ganganagar, his hometown and stories/things associated with it.<br>He tells me, and I am always amused by it, "research karni hai kya iss movie pe" when he finds me reading about the movie I just saw on wikipedia.<br>He maintains his figure, don't know how but he never seem to put on weight at all, however many pizzas or other fatty stuffs he has. I mistake his bones for abs sometimes! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I admire him for his short reaction time and his confidence (in unknown domains as well, he'll get beaten up but won't feel dejected, rather will keep on working).<br>He says I am the only person because of which he's still using foul language... waise isse irritate karne mein mazaa bahut aata hai!<br>What I would like to take from him is his unconditional confidence, his attitude to say, "just bring it on", without realizing the consequences!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Lemme start this testi. with a simple sentence "Maglu Rocks, Maglu Rocks, Maglu Rocks".<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> You want to know the meaning of fun you shd be with this guy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Joking all the time. He is a guy who can also laugh at himself.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but beware all of you because sometimes his arguments and tone of delivering them leaves us all surprised with no answers.( Ask Daddu <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) Extremely gud in studies, his knowledge in python is second to none in our batch. One of the gud and sometimes bad thing abt him is his over-enthusiastic nature and open way of talking. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> He will not keep any secrets or anything in his mind and will tell you what he feels bluntly. Though his physique can a improve a little but his josh is awesome <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> He can take panga with anybody at anytime without thinking of the consequences <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I heard of him when we used to hear stories abt his so called love with a girl of one our batch. Since then his love has changed so many times. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( Yaar isko RAB bahut dikhata hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). But our real intro happened in the summers when I took a project with Daddu. We used to talk a lot during those days. He talks in such a manner that you become his friend the instant you meet him. Then started our long BC sessions in front of GHEB ( most of our talk is about the same thing...   his MS or abt one of our professor or abt Esagu ). And how can I forget "SRI GANGANAGAR". Maglu lemme first clarify that whenever we were making fun of the city, we were trying to start an argument with you and you never disappointed us. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Well that is one of his quality, kabhi bhi haar nahin manana, chahe jaan hi kyun na chali jaye. A little short tempered on some issues but his anger is also for a very short time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Names for him: Maglu, Dulla, Muggles<br>Particular feature: Walking, talking, standing style. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Best of luck for your MS dude, Hopefully you will repace Steve Barmer someday. <br>Hamein hamesha yaad rakhna. Aur ek baar Sri Ganganagar jaroor Ghumna chahenge tumhare saath, bahut saare doubts clear karne hai<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>And one thing "Australia Suc</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Moooohiiit , is a very nice and cool. His way of speaking is really wonderful and cheer your up even in your gloomiest of moments. <br>Really hardworking and good at heart. His way of saying things while laughing really spreads a very good energy in the environment. <br>Keep smiling always !!! </b></i></ul><br><br>
