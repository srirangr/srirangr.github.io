<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When I met him for the first time, I was like - wow, whoz that guy with such a stange but friendly accent. Laughing and talking both at the same time. From the very first instant I began to like this person. I rem our first talk revolved around my AIEEE rank. Actually he was kind of searching thos guys who were top ranker in IIIT. So we met...and this guy poured all the metaphors of appreciation in my legacy ..bond, phodu, genious, newton ..so on <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Well thats Ojas for you...He lend his whole heart out for you. <br>In first year I knew him as a guy who is a game freak..and want to play all available games. We were in diff section and hostel, so I was not opportune enough to have spent much time with him quite often. But whateva few chatting sessions we had were very interesting. Quite often our talks involved with life around, to our hometown and family. And he was the person with so much of experience.<br>He is one of the few person at IIIT whom I admire most. I admire him for his self-belief, attitude. He had clearly set out goals with which he landed in IIIT. Doing good at study and getting a handsome package is okay, but to chill, and live this college life was also his priority. And he indeed accomplished the set out things. Got his  dream job in Microsoft. Besides he added all the possible spices in this college life. So passionately hit the gym, has lost the oodles of weight and has grown into a hunk. I don't know much about his girlfriends but I am sure there must be many wooing around him. In college itself he is so famous among batchmates, and juniors too.<br>I enjoyed the trip with you in Goa...and in future also I will be looking fwd to such trips. And dude I know you will rock where ever u go. All the very best for your future.<br>I will certainly miss you..but being cities apart I dont think there will be distances between our heart. *Friends Forever* </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>There are many notorious nicks by which people call him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, and he has distinctly framed an image of a super hyperactive guy who just whims to have fun and BC all the time. In first year oftenly I have shared a neighboring seat with him in the class. To hell with the lecture, this guy was immersed in his own fancy, always humming some hindi song lullaby. He is one of the few person whom I met till now and are very passionate..the pulse of passion is always in full flow through his veins. I still rem how weirdly he used to play antakshari in class. Let sing 10 Kishore da songs starting with the word "jindagi". He can't remain sit idle even for a while. If there is nothing he pinches u hard - C'mmon why so serious? Then in workspace I alwayz find this guy on high. He is bond in coding, all knows that. I used to sit opposite to him in workspace. "wah kya gaana hai, sound full kar"- he would kind of scream out when he heard one of the kishore da or lucky ali's song playing on my sys.<br>Lots of our talk involved to my home town, to garhwal where he has spent 5 years ...and is totally in love with it. Well I will make u recherish those days again...let visit the place again sometime near in future, I will be looking fwd to that trip..whateva I used to narrate u about that place u will urself see that.<br>I admire him for his passion. Someone told me that this guy completed the whole series of Friends in straight 2-3 seatings skipping even meals. I am avid reader of his blog. This guy just pour out his heart on the blog. I really enjoy reading them.Keep writing.<br>I know you as a good friend, though haven't spent much time with u..stay in touch. *Friends Forever*<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I hardly interacted with him in first year. His face keeps me reminding of my friend back in school..who was not looks like him but also the nature. He is total BC guy. Though I witnessed only few BC sessions..as people have impression here I don't do BC <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> But I came more in his contact in kerala trip that we had in second year. It was his plan, his management, his company..that made that trip a huge memorabilia. He has a very peculiar way of having fun. Picking a murga and then "uski taang kheenchna", doing in limit.Hate cracking PJs and even listening to them, he only needs pure fun, pure BC. <br>I indeed admire your cool nature. He doesn't give a damn about anything. Everything he does is what his heart prompted. I have seen him always happy and spreading the smile around as if saying "sun yaar chill maar". And he understands people very well..knows their comfort zone..and try to suit and mingle accordingly.<br>He is good coder and has got oodles of brains which he don't think wise enough to use in study. yeah  I rem, during placement dayz I was so nervous when I screwed in some interviews. I grew superstitious too.. after he was selected for citrix I borrowed his shirt...it happened to be so lucky that in  next interview I cracked..*abhi tak nahi lautai yaar, har baar bhool jaata hoon* <br>I am so happy that we landed in the same city. I din had the much pleasure to be in his friendly company in colg... I only observed him as friendly, "dil ka nek" guy. But I guess in Bangalore we will simply rock. Believe me I have my share of BC locked within for reason known/unknown <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> ,and I am going to unlock that sooner.<br>cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I know him right from first year as we were both in same section. While I was new to colg I was kind of reserved and quiet, then one day in morn session of PT I met this guy while playing Volleyball. I was new to the game and was playing in his side. I missed many shots..then I saw this guy with so much confidence and he started blabbering with me...infact he was commanding everyone on the field though he din knew anyone thr.That misconception of arrogance disappeared when we talked. I realised how friendly and honest is this person. Much of the time in the two years I had spent with him.Chatting for hrs, roaming around, sharing or lil secrets of school life...I still rem when he opened his heart to me. Besides we began to study together and doing assignments.<br>I have my mobile handset which I bought on his advice...Sony Ericsson on Soni's advice. Yaar this mobile will alwayz keep reminding me f u...till I buy a new handset <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . And yeah It will obviously be sony ericsson again.<br>He has given me a unique nick name...can't write here...*bhai wo naam bhi yaad rahega* .<br>I praise him for his self-beleif, confidence. This guy has  a damn +ve attitude..If-someone-can-do-it-so-can-I. Very good at academics as his record says...Bond in Maths.<br>A great fan of Madhavan and SRK. His wearing spects has a history hidden behind them. Sorry to reveal that here. This person was so fanatic fan of SRK in childhood, he donned wearing glasses deliberately inspired by SRK style (perhaps from Bazigar). Thats how he weakened his eye sight..and now dons those glasses for a permanent style..btw they look cool on you. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Offered many times to visit his home...but somehow I missed the opportunity. But will rem that night when he took me and Bajaj to a club night event of whom his father was a member. We had delicious dinner there and met his cool and very friendly Pa.He danced with his Pa on DJ that night. Me and Bajaj were just looking around.yaar u are one of the closest friend I made in IIIT. stay in touch. *Friends Forever*<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Dj Ranga, the nick aptly describe him...he is a rocking dude and a big entertainer, always offering his DJing skills. I know him from 1st year as we both were in Agni house and in same hostel. For some days I went with him to participate in the rehearsal for fresher skit. It was then when I realised how talented is this guy..he can sing, he can dance,he can act..he can do all racha stuff <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Whenever he would meet me he wud open up with a friendly conversation, a cute smile flickering alwayz on his face.<br><br>Then in second year..I had the pleasure to go with him for Kerala trip. And believe me right from the start of the journey this dude was full in form as entertainer. That non-stop singing through out the night on that jeep journey will be cherished forever yaar. Then I knew how romantic is this person at heart. He is kind of jack of all trades...participate in almost every cultural activitees in the campus, and of course gud at study too.<br><br>When in future his name strike my mind..a image will be in mind as of a vibrant, jovial, full-of-energy, that cute extended smile, some rocking DJ song playing in bg. <br>Dj Ranga..be the same, u will rock whereeva u go.<br>It was grt knowing u ..we will stay in touch to carry fwd this dostana.<br>All the very best for your future.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is a person of gem..seriously. Very friendly and honest with you- talk straight from his heart. I rem my first year when I used to feel homesick.I was so happy that we had room nearby in the hostel. Our first meet was just like any other acquaintances. But right from the first moment I felt that dept of friendliness in him. And sooner we become gud pals..and I wud come every now and then to his room and chat about my hometown, family and many other things. He talks hindi in a very sweet Hyderabadi accent. I really love to hear you when you speaks hindi in such innocent manner <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> - warna yahan toh logon ki jubaan pe bas kadwi galliyian hi nikalti hai <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.<br>We did many assignments together and I love those dayz when lil tension was there reg submission and each one f us trying to cheer up the mood. <br>Yeah, this dude is very romantic at heart..believe me <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He is great fan of SRK and Madhavan..if I am not wrong. Writes so beautiful and romantic poetry. Those are really great yaar..wud love to get one autographed from u as a gift to me.<br>Those first 2 years that we spent so merrily and having our share of fun are indeed to be cherished forever. This person always supported me right through any panic, dilemma...a friendly advice from him was a tonic to me.<br>It was grt having u friend in IIIT..and let make this friendship forever. We will stay in touch dude.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He used to sit next to me in First years' classes and second year also. Besides we were in same hostel and same floor in GHEB. I can say I have spent lots of time with this person.I never saw him with eyes open listening to any lectures in first year. He has this great skill of sitting erect and silently drooping his eyelids behind his spects. Even the prof has the impression he is so meekly listening to the lectures. The whole first year he spent sleeping in the class. When I asked him why he do so...he said that he din slept the whole night. There was BC going on his room..The dude, Atul DVD was his room partner. So neither he study in classes nor in room. This guy was so trapped...and he screwed big time with his grades. Later in second year he realised. So despite the noisy BC atmosphere in his room, U will find him huddled in a corner, fingers plugging his ears...and concentrating hard on his course book.But he never complained. Might be he liked those goofy talks...and soon he mastered the way of studying with background BC going on.<br><br>He dreams a lot..see weird to weirdest dreams. And then he recount them to me in exact details. Inspired by his dreams he began to write a blog where he narrates his dreams. He infact wrote a good long story titled  "sleeping in class" for his literature course. And this story is going to publish soon..congrats scientist.<br>This person has got some sparky wires in his brain. Crack PJs of utmost quality- true to their defination. Those chats in NBH mess table will be remembered scientist for long. <br>When I was new to college, I found certain degree of ease in his room..I wud come quite often in his room and he wud greet me with that extended curve smile resembling of a joker <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He is a great dancer too..I guess ppl might be knowing this on our batch. Has got gud looks. Right now doing his MS, but sees himself as a writer in near future...another Chetan Bhagat in making.It was great knowing u scientist..will certainly miss u. Stay in touch coz someone will always remember u.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd..<br>lekin ye bada frustu tha us samay..aur gaane bhi waise wale hi sunta tha..mere ko bhi senti karta tha. Lekin jab kabhi masti ya BC wali baat chalti thi kabhi peeche nahin rehta tha. Entertainer hai yaar....kisi ko nahin darta, seedhe muh pe bolta hai. Patani kitni mails bheji hai isne ..assignment pending se le k portal wali.<br>I have spent much time with him and had discussed so many thing with him...will miss u mux. final year mein I think hamare beech kuch duriyan si ho gyi..inkey courses alag ho gye..aur mein naye grp mein pad gya. But placement k dauran banda active ho gya...ye intial dayz mein hamein prog assignment mail karta tha..ek deadline bhi fixed karta tha.Bhai tune Jawahar wali feel la di thi...thanks to u <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>ek gaana arj hai ,,"ye dosti hum nahin todenge..."<br>All the best dude. we are friends forever, bas duniya k kisi bhi kone mein yaad kar liyo...hazir ho jaaonga <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is one of the first person in IIIT whom I befriended and one of the close friend I made in these 4 years.First year mein apne hi section mein tha. Ajeeb ajeeb si harkatein karke hamesha focus mein rehta tha class ki. Compilers ki class mein wo Sir ko bolna ki ITS TIME, class end ho chuki hai...bhai manna padega.Workspace mein wo nautanki karna. Isse iska computer hi nahin chalta tha...mouse k sath wahan beitha chue-billi ka khel khelta tha. 1st year mein bas hamari mulakat ya toh class mein hoti thi ya phir workspace mein..just friendly aquaintances limited to "Hi". Then one day He told me that I look like on of his friend from Jaipur. He even showed me his pics on orkut. Patani wo meri tarah dikhta hai ki ni...but tu uske baad mere ko apne friend ki tarah treak karne lag gya. Gymkhane mein hamne ek sath kasrat karni start kar di. Aur mein iske room pe aksar aaya karta tha GHEB se. Iske sath Indian Idol dekha tha...banda bada excited rehta tha...ek bandi pe fida tha ye, naam bhool rha hoon yaar(bacho jaisa gaati thi wo). phir ek baar iske sath Nalsar University gye the unki fest mein...kafi door thi yaar univ....aur uper se us din unke main events bhi nahin the....kher it was nice exp with u...kuch karnaame bhi kiye tune wahan sayad.<br>phir kerala trip pe hum sath rawana hue....yaar ye banda rockhik tha puri trip mein...maja aa gya sahi mein...wo buses mein unchi awaaj mein gaana(mux ka gala to massahallah). phir isne apni ek aur harkat ko anjaam diya(aadat se majboor hai na <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) .Ye ATM se paise withdraw karne gya..jab cash bahar aaya ..ye banda mast ho k wait karta rha(patani kya experiment kar rha tha <img src=Smileys/13.gif />), turant cash ander chala gya machine k..aur isko chuna lag gya. But maje ki baat ye rhi ki..hum branch k manager k pass gye...and maje ki baat hai ki paise sahi salamat dak dwara colg k pate pe aa gye within a month.<br>Banda bada senti rehta tha yaar...apne grades aur cg ko leke. Ye yahi sochta tha log kya ghutti khate hain ki wo 9 ptr ban jaatey hain. kher ab ye bhi 9 ki sg ko touch kar gya hai..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>bahut hi unique si personality hain yaar ye..has got potential skills in everythings to rock. Mujhe yaad hai ye apne aap ko to low-profile rakhta tha aur samne wale ko khoob chadata tha...I am still intrigued ye iska apne pe under-estimation hai ya phir logon k maje le k bc karta hai.Bhai jaan ne 1st year mein Michal Jackson wala dance kiya tha Fresher pe(dangerous wala <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ) maje ki baat gaane mein hi inbuilt taaliyian baj rhi thi, kisi show ki recording utha le aaya. Kher dance acha tha, aisi baat nahin hai. But uske baad isne ek baar aur karna chaha apne house k liye sayad, ye hamein dikha rha tha rehearsal. Apne sath Sunil Soni tha, usne iski itni gandi utari ki uske baad aajtak kabhi is kala ko bahar nahin ubhara. Haan uske baad janab Basket ball court pe apna talent dikhane lage. Exams k time pe toh banda bada frustu rehta tha, meine ye nahin pada....wo nahin pada, abe itna rota tha saala, layega Ekka har crs mein...but kuh log aadat se majboor hote hain.<br>I have seen metamorphism in him..he has grown into more mature (good) human being. He now understand peoples around him more clearly.He has got the placement wot he deserve after such hard work he inflicted on him. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Ye dusri baaton ko bhi le k frustu rehta tha....bhai itne video songs dekhein hai mein iske sath...aur itna frustata tha ye banda..Tera number bhi aayega yaar( tu sabr toh kar mere yaar.. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>All the best dude for ur future...and stay in touch.It was grt knowing u in these 4 yrs.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I generally take time to make friends as per my nature. He is one of the person with whom I have spent ample amount of time in IIIT in these 4 years( we had been wing mates for some time too.) In these 4 yrs well we have strengthened our relationships and become good friends. This guy is so busy with his mind that every now and then something always pop up in his mind in form of doubt/questions. A happy-go-lucky kinda fella, keeps al his worries at bay, and do everything with sheer determination and passion be it anything(only one <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> plus point of his being extra inquisistive)<br>1st year se dekh raha hoon inhe, janab hamesha chatting pe lage rehte hain, patani kitni baalikaon ke beech vyast rehte hain hamare kabra kanhiya <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> janab ka gajab ka sense of humor hai aur hanste bhi mashallah bade dichasp tareke se hain...apni puri bateese bheekerte hue <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, no doubt itni ladkiyian ke beech chatiyate rehte hain.Colg k kuch shandaar din in k sath gujare hain. Haan kabhi bhai k sath shopping karne jaan, naani yaad aa jaeygi <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, patani kaunsa kapda inhe pasan aata hai jo kabhi manufacture hi nahin hota. ghoomne phirne ke bhi saukeen hain, had couple of outing with him- keral trip, tripuati. But kabhi kabhi he is a real pain in ass, mein bhi mana nahin kar pata jo ye janab bolte hain..but thats okay, no need to complain.inki company mein entertainment khhob jee bhar k hota hai.<br><br>stay in touch dude..and all the very best for ur future.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>ye janab Toh Dosti ki misaal hain... Jai-Veeru wala dostana nibhane ki mansikta rakhta hai( don't think other way Dostana <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). 1st aur 2nd year mein maloom toh tha ki ek Alok naam ka saksha hamare batch mein hai. But kabhi dhang se vartalaap nahin hui...reason again same - diff section, diff hostels. It was in third year, we came in contact aur phir toh dostana kafi phala bada. Janab compromise nahin karte. Agar abhi padai karni hai toh koi lakh mana lo, ye banda tas se mas nahin hoga. kafi logon ko gyan baanta hai inhone. aur inki mahima ka bakhan sabhi log karte hain. And I always felt comfortable in his company , thats why I used to knock on his door every now and then. Milke kayi movies bhi dekhi, wo baat alag hai janab beech mein hi so jaatey the. <br>He has sheer dedication to his work.And is so pure to his heart. Goa trip mein bhai ke sath khoob matargasti hui..it will be deep imprinted in my mind..especially that incident...aur wo bike ride. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>And I am so happy that we are going to land in the same city...will be friends forever.<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Very few person are in this world, who are same inside-out. Paro is one of them. We were in diff section in first year, and it was at the end of the first year we talked for the first time in relation to our scholarship from CBSE, which we din get. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>The very first impression was that this guy is pure and friendly like me. Again the same thing. All the friends I made were either section apart or hostel apart. It was in 3rd year we started hanging out quite more often and our friendship grew more deeper. uske baad toh phir BTP partner ban gaye. thanks to him, that mera BTP complete ho gaya in which I meagerly worked. <br>I think over the time Paro has evolved. From a reserved guy he has become now a cool, more fun loving, and I-don't-give-a-damn kinda person.Ab toh SRK ban gaya hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Jolly gud Paro.Last year toh kafi time spent kiya humne. wo placement ki preparations, Coffeeshop k round marna atleast 4 times a day, sath mein movies dekhna.<br>par janab ek mod aur aa gaya is dosti mein. We going to become city apart, but thats only physical distances. Aage bhi mil ke aish karenge.<br><br><b> Strong points : Determined and dedicated, honest and true to the def of friend.<br>Not so weak point : People may exploit his soft nature.<br>My advice : Be the same...U will rock.<br>Song 4 u : I am the best..(SRK wala <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br>... to be continued.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>As his name strike in my mind, always a smile flicker on my face. His persona is enough to charm anyone- very humble, down-to-earth *ahem ahem* <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> , and always make everyone comfortable in his company. I think that is the main factor that almost everyone appreciate him.<br>In first year, we only exchanged acquaintances. He was CR, and I wud say "Hi' whenever I meet him, to which he promptly give a humble hand wave. My philosophy says - avoid people who don't make you feel comfortable. In "daddu's" case I always wanted to be in his company right from the first year. But we were hostel-apart till second year, and we usually meet at the mess table. Our friendship started growing more in third year when I shifted to NBH. This was then I started understanding him more clearly. He appreciate u for good things, criticize for bad things to make u bring change in u. It was only then I realised hes Daddu not only by "naam" but by "kaam" also. Mind u He has holidayed in  25 cantries ( whoops countries) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , I hope this number will increment soon. ( with mine too, starting from  nill). On almost everything he can give u advice. It was fun when we started crash tutorials before every exam in my room. Padna toh ek bahana tha. Inko managment skill ke kisse toh sabhi ko maloom hain, no need to recount here. Had some wonderful time with him in Kerala trip, Tripuati. <br>And yeah those time spent in placement preparation will be cherished for long. Aajkal mere ko bike riding k lesson de raha hai...thanks daddu, mein tere armanon mein khara utroonga. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br><b> He is : Impermeable to any bad comment.<br>    My advice : is that never let ur passion dry for fulfilling ur aims.<br>    Song Fit for you: Tere jaise yaar kahan... </b><br>to be continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
