<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He's one of the persons in our batch for whom the nick name I've invented has become so popular that people began calling him with that dirty nick and to an extent that many don't even know his original name (I'm exaggerating <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). We call him Kartheek or Kar"thick" or "lathika" or "M" thati or M___ thati or simply M____. Kindly excuse me for not filling in the blanks -- due to censor reasons.<br><br>There, in fact, are many adjectives with which one can describe this guy. "super kasi" being the prominent one. Needless to say, he's very good at studies. He plays every sport very well and is very good at football.<br><br>We share many opinions and interests especially trying out new linux distros on our laptops weekly. Always eager for crazy conversations and arguments. To put it in a nutshell, he's a geek. That one word is enough to describe him. The way he analyses everything, the depth to which he thinks about anything is truly amazing. <br><br>Hey, you still remember the day during 1st year endsems when we watched Naa Autograph and began calling each other "Lathika" <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Those were one of the memorable moments we spent in IIIT-H.<br><br>Lucky to have a friend like you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and be what you are. Aa smile eppudu alaane undani. Ade neeku andam. Coffeelu taagadam koncham tagginchuko ra kanna...inka nallaga ayipothav. Ippatike nee mokham lo kallu, pallu tappa emi kanipinchav! <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Hope you ECD guys come out of IIIT-H atleast after 6 years... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Haa... ostha raa mee Sathupally ki o roju ninnu saavagottadaniki. All the best for your future. Please do invite me for your thesis presentation.

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>neeku first testimonial nenu raddam anukunna .. screw you Lashi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..<br><br>anyways .. MNV is one of the coolest doods of our batch. just that most people don;t know about him. Coz he's always busy doing some projects. Unfortunately he is in ECD (dual degree <img src=Smileys/7.gif />) and works very hard to keep up. One thing I like about this chap is that he is very prominent and punctual <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Open to talk to everyone. One more thing that people might not know about him is that he is a linux g33k. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>He's also a very hard working guy. Very ambitious. He's so honestly working that his mentor in GE gifted him an iPod for his contribution. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Yet he's so simple. Has an aweomse taste for movies. There was a time when I used to watch ONLY those movies which were recommended by him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Never gets angry at me how much ever I pull his leg <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. And always believes in me. Always gives a feeling that "I'm always there for you brother" <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Came to know more about him from Sashidhar when they were room mates in Bangalore. These guys did many "koti panulu" <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> at Bangalore and always after doing some koti pani they used to call me up and tell me about those.<br><br>Coming to sports, he plays foorball (never watched him playing but people say he's AWESOME <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). <br><br>One of my best friends in IIIT. I'm gonna miss you a lot buddy. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> I'm gonna miss all those conversations we had in mess. Those movie critics. Everything.<br><br>Be as you are. Don't ever stop smiling. Some faces look incomplete without a smile. Yours is one of them. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> You are a very good person. A kind of a person who can change somebody's life. Don;t think much about what you said to others and what others think about you. <br><br>All the best for your thesis. I feel lucky to have met an awesome guy like you. And yeah! Never forget me.<br><br><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Love<br>- DJ</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first project that i did in IIIT is with this guy(under bezawada). That was a good learning experience for various reasons. And we partnered to form a programming team also. We were among the top scorers from IIIT in one of the contests too. <br><br>Over years, he has transformed into a better football player day after day. He played for vayu, and then for the batch and now he is playing for IIIT. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br><br><br>We had long discussions on  topics ranging from research options, iiit-students, iiit-courses, life-at-iiit, research and so on. He has always been striving for perfection (forget the g.p.a thingy for a while). He says things like 'It not the place that creates the people but it the people who create *the place*.' <br><br>I'm looking forward to read the thesis he is going to write. I bet, it will be a worthful read. <br><br>Message for you: Don't bother too much about the little things happening around you. </b></i></ul><br><br>
