<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Only one adjective suffices for describing this guy -- "Kasi". But there is more to him than meets the eye. Also called as "potti" sana, "sheik" sana, "SHIT" sana, "kasi" sana, "pee kay" sana, "shetty" sana, "item" sana and "kasi" ____a, he is an ideal child any parent would crave for, an obedient student any professor would search for, a friendly friend any friend would wait for and a trust-worthy lover any girl would die for. And believe me, I'm not exaggerating. Ladies and gentlemen, lemme introduce to you a great friend of mine and my roomie in IIIT-H for more than two years, THE GREAT Sana alias Pradeep Kumar Sana. <br><br>Being a very stubborn guy, no body dares to argue with him or tries to talk with him when he's in an argument with other person. He tries to win any argument, by hook or crook. And in the process becomes an "item" (that's a different story altogether <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). He's one helluva hard-working and sentimental guy you could ever come across in the 21st century. Aggravating it further, he is a vegetarian for 4 days of the week <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Praying god for 10 mins daily, going to temple weekly, fasting monthly, wearing only one pair of clothes (read lucky/sentimental) to all the exams are few acts that make him seem an alien to our college <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. And in spite of all these, within very less time you'll become so attached with him and addicted with his friendship that it's difficult to part with even if you wish to (I won't <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Being a room mate to him for 2 yrs without any issues is a testimony to that.<br><br>I don't know how many times we teased him using his hometown's (Seekakulam <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) name, his height and his project under M.B. but he never lost his cool. Keep it up dude!<br><br>He's very good at academics <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> and at the same time a very good cricket player (and a captain too), actor (we won't forget the Rajni's fight sequence in skit) and stuntman <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . <br><br>You've got an amazing smile. Keep smiling!! All the best for your MS ra. Be what you are. Hope you divorce with M.B. and get out of this place asap.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>According to me, <b>potti sana</b> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> is the koooooooooooooooooolest lad in IIIT. Nenu ninnu potti antunnanenti anukuntunnava? Nuvvu naa kante potti e le <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Almost everyone knows that Sana and Kasi (<img src=Smileys/26.gif />) are synonyms. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but he'd never agree. Nevertheless, his kasi isn;t enough to call him a g33k. He's gt an awesome awesome (this is not a typo. I wantedly wrote awesome twice) sense of humour and no one would ever feel bored in his company. <br><br>An awesome cricket player too. An awesome captain. He always chose me in his team and always made sure that every player gets batting or bowling and no one is left behind without entertainment. He's the one with the attitude: <b> losing/winning is just a part of the game what matters is did everyone enjoyed the game or not. </b> A biiiiig hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to that  spirit of yours dude.<br><br>Also Sana has a golden leg. In IBCT finals 09, it Sana because of which a long partnership came to en end. Rajini skills upiyoginchadu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>From Rajini, I remember the stage shaking, stage breaking, mind blowing (and all other adjectives ..) performance given by Sana on Felicity 3rd day. I just can't describe in words how suppppppppppppperb your performance was. It was almost like Rajini came down to IIIT and performed for all of us on the stage <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. What a lovely performance man! A <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your talent dude.<br><br>He's very active when it comes to giving bumps. But most of the times ends up getting more bumps for himself than the birthday boy. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>Will miss you a lot buddy. <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Will miss all the matches that we played together. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>Only message for you: <b> You are awesome </b>.<br><br>All the very very very best for your MS and your future as well. Keep rocking as always. And never forget me <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vvchaitanya.html>V.V.Chaitanya Krishna</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He's one of the first persons i've met in campus. During the first 2 years in GHEB, he used to be one of da first few ones who wake up early,go to PT, come back to have the first shower of the day in the floor. He's one guy to invoke activity in ne gathering wer he's present. Either by being a victim 2 sattires by "gopu" <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> or being the creator of sattires on his "soul-mate" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> kirku, he always makes sure tht the environment arnd him is filled up with joy. <br><br>Perhaps, I mite describe him as shortly as his height is <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. The better version mite b with the girls @ srikakulam <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> The craze he has in der is truly mind-blowing! neone wud think only one thing--"Pottodi ki intha scene unda??". But the chats he does wid the girls in his hometown and the fact tht sumone in the campus gave her mail id widout even he asking 4 it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, reveals this concealed trait in him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> His idea of becoming a "sheik" and getting named as "sheik sana" is sumthin i can never forget <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>But on serious note, he's a gr8 guy 2 b with. He is very understanding, gives utmost values to sentiments and makes sure that his frnds r happy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The way he takes all the sattires showered on him by big-wigs like "gopu" and almost all the times,giving a smile as reply is simply gr8 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I hope he gets a better person as his prof and finishes his thesis soon ( jus as his "KASI" wud drive him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). <br><br>I'll definitely miss u wen i'm out of campus dude <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> will meet ya often neways....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Some intelligent guy once said " Friendship is all abt sharing ur similarities and celebrating ur differences" <br>      I think diz was wat happened wid sana 'n' me .. the 4 years though v didn't concur on many things; v never let those affect our friendship .. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Coming to how it all started in the first year on the first day of my class a small guy ( who looked lyk secondary school student ) was introducing himself jovially to all the ECD bakras saying "My name is Pradeep " (now dont ask me who he is ) From dat day on he never let that enthusiasm die and carried it along for all the four years .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Both of us form the "potti dhoni" and "mass yuvi" pair in da cricket ground and the number of times v lost is jus one less dan number of classes taken by his so called 'mentor' M.B.Srinivas in our entire semester .. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Used to play as forwards in futbal for our batch in first year but hav no idea y he quit ( naa laaga roju goals kottadam kashtam be <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).. inka park cheyyabothu bikes ni crash cheyyadam ; gantalu koddi chattin cheyyadam ; photolaki keka keka phoselu ivvadam ; item telugu movies cam prints chudadam nd hindi movies ni subtitles tho chudadam Chinna Sana vaari bulli hobbylu.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>  Sana to me is friendly to the core , active 24 X 7 , deep thinker , responsible , sincere devotee (goes to temple evry weekend) and stubborn (nobody is perfect le ra..not even Pedda Sana ) .. v ver da integral part of a so called dream team whch had the potential to reach the main stage of felicity in antakshari but 'vidhi aadina naatkamlo memu rendusarlu bali ka bakralamu ayyamu' <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> .. But v finally made it to the main stage of felicity thru our skit nd "rajni sana " & "remo reddy" again bcame a hit pair .. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> Da moments during da skit practice ver da moments v vud lyk to savour nd cherish 4 a longtym ..
