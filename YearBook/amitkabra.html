<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kabra bhai!!!<br><br>We have almost studied together for IIT.. and he was the only friend of mine when I entered in this college first time.. Ultimate banda hai ye .. kabhi bura nahi manta and dil ka kafi achcha hai, humesha mast mood me raheta ... <br>I guess he is the Most POPULAR guy of our batch .. for his hobby<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> of asking questions<img src=Smileys/7.gif />..humesha apne doubt clear karne ki koshish karta hai .. that s really admirable ... but the bad thing is khud se sochna ki try kam karta hai ...  sahi me kabre bhai .... will miss u alot ... hope we'll remain in touch with each other ....<br><br>best of luck for you love life<img src=Smileys/21.gif />!!!<br>don't ever forget me!!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>All I have learnt from others about Amit Kabra is that he's like a quizmaster, only he doesn't have the answers...<br>Anyways, I've had limited interaction with him, some may say its good but I think its bad especially when I have to write a testimonial for him.<br>I've seen him as someone who works hard, asks many questions and plays soccer or go for a jog and who becomes stubborn sometimes...<br>He sees me as a fattebaaz. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>His walking style is amusing... he swings his hand as done in march past. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I don't feel that he asks too many questions... that could be either because I do have the same questions in my mind and I don't ask or it might be that he's too afraid that I might speak out a fatta that he doesn't ask many questions in my presence. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his ability to ask question when in doubt (on a serious note).<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kabra<br>has a great deal of inquisiteness inside him...to know abt things around him...how they happen and all d process behind it...its a big quality in itself...but d problem comes when he doesn't look for answers himself but prefers asking them frm people...so Kabra bhai...logon pe depend mat karo...log hamesha dhokha denge...believe in ur self and u'l suceed....i can recall whn he came to me at d time of placement very tensed asking for which companies to sit in etc etc..i could point out d panic in his voice...he did well to overcome tht situation and end up wid a gud job</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hamara ek aur rajasthani bhai....  We were together in A3... english class... Tab se lekar ab tak banda vaise ka vaise hi hai.... Doubts bhi same hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( Toh )... Chalo ab tak sabne tujhe bata hi diya hoga ki tu doubts bahut puchhta hai toh main isse repeat nahin karunga but yeh kahunga ki tujhe Quest for knowledge hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... <br>The best thing abt this guy is that he will say watever is in his heart abt u.... he will not think before saying that... Though that is a very gud thing but still sometimes the other person may not feel that gud abt it....  So dude u shd continue saying ur heart out but choose ur words carefully ( and also ur pitch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> )....  Daddu ka roommate... I came to know him better during summer holidays.... we both were doing summer project.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... His dedication towards studies is applauding ... <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... Bahut chinta leta hai wen it comes to assignments and exams (meri tarah hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...)... he is very punctual too (is baat mein opposite hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )... will always complete all the assignments before time <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... or atleast know that there is one <img src=Smileys/4.gif />....<br>iske saath DDBMS ka project liya tha.. bahut pareshaan hua tha yeh ( aur main bhi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )...  because he wanted to do the project in one way and i wanted to do it in modules... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... but humane project pura kar hi diya tha aakhirkaar ( kam se kam prof. ko to impress kar hi diya tha...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br>Vaise dude tumhare kai doubts solve karte karte mujhe bhi help hui during placements... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> kuchh cheeze main dhang se samajh gaya tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... So thank u for that...<br>Daddu ki advice ek baar phir se padh lena....  aur dim dim ko jagmagate rahna <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... <br>aur haan apna chadha iiit ko daan karke jana <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br>Lots of people makes fun of your doubts and I am no exception, but long back I concluded that they're nothing but a bit extra effort to learn more. Anyways you had better decide for yourself.<br><br>Have fun. Yaheen Hyderabad mein rahenge. Milte rahenge. <br><br><b>Gut feeling for you:</b> You'll get married pretty soon.<br><b>Memories:</b> Kabra ki katli hansi.<br><b>Tags:</b> Ajmer, TA, CSE, football, doubts <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><br><b>Reading Kabra's testimonial </b>was a pleasant surprise for me... he mentions that there are certain qualities in me that he admires. It's nice to read that, because Kabra is a good fella and it's nice to receive compliments from him.<br><br>I've known Kabra for five years now. We were in the same coaching in Ajmer. So I'll start my testimonial from there only. And make no mistake, Kabra had a reputation quite similar to what he has in IIIT - that of a person who asks a lot of doubts. But at the same time, everyone admired his hardworking nature. Things progressed and we both got admission to IIIT. And Kabra's legacy continued. He's still managed to retain the inquisitiveness in him.<br><br>Like others have written, even I sometimes feel that his doubts become a bit too much at times. I think you should take some time out to analyse the issue on your own. But I really admire the spirit behind it - to continuously improve oneself and the determination and grit to carry on without caring about the world laughing at you. <br><br><b>The spirit shows</b> in every aspect of Kabra's personality. Came here after two year drops. And once he was here, his CG has consistently improved. A very good student indeed. Company after company rejected him, but he persevered on. And after placements when people usually take a chill pill, this guy still kept on applying for companies. Nothing short of the best will satisfy him, it seems. Badhiya hai, keep up the same spirit buddy. Bahut aage jaana hai abhi.<br><br>Baatein bahut si hain... Ajmer ki aur IIIT ki bhi. Kabra ka cycle pe ghar jaana, uski moochhein, ragging period, saath mein football khelna, jageh jageh bc aur discussions karna, CAT period - one time jab ki main Kabra ki thodi help kar saka, placements... jab ki main kehna chahta raha ki buddy maybe you're trying a bit too hard, but then decided against it.<br><br><i>contd.</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the most talked about guys of our batch, so much has been written and said about him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, there's nothing much left for me to write. Anyways here goes one for our beloved Kabra. A great guy to be with, with a fondness for cracking jokes and laughing on it, there's always something on in his mind. (A great trait to have by the way <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Although sometimes gets a bit too much for him that which (un)fortunately comes out of his mouth And when it comes it just doesn't stop <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I hope you get what I am trying to say. Sample this, Abey!!! EPL kya hai? EPL mein koun koun hai?? EPL kahaan hoti hai?? Though it does sound irksome to many a person, I take that with a different view. It is the sheer innocence with which this guy shoots up questions, that you can't help but try and come with an answer much to his liking <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Just hope his 'curiosity' sustains itself for a long time to come, otherwise Kabra wouldn't be himself <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>A never-say-die attitude is something that defines him. Be it academics, his love interests <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> he is prepared to put in the hard yards. A real hard working guy <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, is always prepared for a slog <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. It is this quality which one can find in him in abundance. Hats off for this, dude <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Talk about dedication and perseverance.<br><br>Off late, he has emerged as a dark horse with respect to girls. Has made a girlfriend with more of them in the waiting <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He recently arranged a conference chat with all his 'chhamiyas' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Casanova in the truest sense. <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br><br>It has been a wonderful journey all these years that we've spent in college and hope that it lasts longer now that we'll be living in the same apartment. On that note, a piece of advice, please  be a little less frugal <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, you are now a (big) buck earning guy <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Din ki shuruwat ek ? se aur end bhi ek ? se hoti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Do saal saath reh kar aur do saal alag reh kar bhi mujhe ye samajh nahin aaya ki questions puchne mai kya maza hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. well jokes apart apni apni capacity hoti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>We were roommates for the first two years in iiit. Both of us had different interst and goals. He was more into studies and mai away from studies. I remember in the first month of ragging i used to come very late in the night from OBH and without any hesitation he used to open the door. <br><br>Ek baar ka mujhe yaad hai jab maine isse koi doubt batane se mana kar diya aur fir thodi der baad mujhe bahut dukh hua ki i was rude to him. After a while I came back to room and said sorry peeping my head from half open door. You should have seen him kya kya bura nahi bola isne mujhe. Ek baar ko to mujhe bhi apne aap pe doubt sa hone laga <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Lekin kya karta his questions vary from "body lotion kahan lagate hai" to "Visa and passport mai difference kya hota hai". But onething to learn from this is that he had a passion to learn anything new he comes across.<br><br>He was regular at football. Anyone can identify him in the field with his distinct chadda (bumchum ka). He played for the batch in some of the events. But I don't know y has he stopped playing it now.<br><br>He is very sincere and hardworking. Very rarely it happened that he slept earlier to me in the night. We had very good understanding between each other. We hardly fought each other on something. I will never forget those moments when we used to take up a random topic before sleep, mostly kota ki yaadein and laugh like hell. You are supportive and have understanding but still one advice to you, don't be dependent on others for every small thing.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kyun ? Kaise ? Kab ? Kahan ? Kaun ?<br><br>KATLI bhai is full of questions and loads of questions. You say one sentence and his reply will be a long list of questions. Mera Rajasthani bhai, shared same coaching institute. His questions are sometimes very irritating and thats why I never interacted much with him. I feel his ques asking tendency has reduced a bit. Once we were travelling in train and some guy was reading Word Power and Kabra bhai saw him doin that. He started his questions about the book and went on for like hours (it seemed to me like hours <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). From that day onwards I always refrained from travelling with him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>But I must admit that he is quite good at whatever he does. Manintained a decent CG throughout. Don't know why did he took so much time to get placed but that doesn't matter much because funally he did. Just want to ask him one thing - bhai itne kyun question poochhta hai tu ?<br><br>Good luck. God Bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The Katlis the Kabras <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>When anyone in our batch heard the word 'Kabra' the only thing comes to their mind is 'doubt' <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We both were in A3. I still remember he used to sit in the fornt row and asking so many doubts .... doubts se lagta tha bhaut fodu banda hai.<br>When it comes to grades and career .... he put is his complete effort. pta nahi kya karega grades ka <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Iski gtalk list dekho to sayd he koi hoga jise isne add na kar rakha ho <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..door door se rishtedari nikal leta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He is ambitious and really caring for his future. I could see his dedication for CAT n placements. Keep this spirit up. Summer'08 main ise bhi apne sath raat ko chay pilane obh le jata ....or fir kabhi start up kabhi puzzles kabhi CAT ke question kya kya nahi <br>discuss karte the NBH ke samne beth ke . 4th year me we to padosi ban gaye. <br>When it comes to BC .... bahut bada BCBaaz hai .... hasna start kare to samne wala ghabra jaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Sometimes he is really funny.

The guy from the little village Bejanagar <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, badi umeed lie chalte hai hamesha, always confident about his goals <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. If someone has done something nice ... he says "ye to koi gaon wala bhi kar lega" then smile hehehe <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. It is because of U I never got over-confident, u always kept me in limits, by pointing out my weaknesses. Aaj tak yaha ek gf nahi bani <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> ... lekin bhai-saab 3-4  ko ek saath lee ke chalte hai .. khuub fast gaddi bhag rahi hai inki. CAT ke time I used to stay wid him, as usual he asked soooo many doubts which eventually made my concepts more strong. Jo bhi ho inko chahiyea bilkul Best.

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Amit Kabra</u><br><br>One name, which many people in our batch dread. Why??<br>Not that big a secert, just Coz he asks too many questions <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> The character of Paresh Rawal in Judai or Sunil Shetty in One,Two, Three seem as if they are higly exaggerated versions of apna Kabra. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Apne kam se kam rakhne wala banda, never seen him poking his nose in anybody else's matters. Although his questions can be irritating at times but thankfully I have rarely been on the recieving end of his questions, thanks for that man. Although I have enjoyed a lot, listening to the escapades of other people with him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Gotta say, I appreciate his never quenching thirst for knowledge. I am always too lazy to even ask things when I dont udnerstand things.<br><br>One of the hardest worker around, always appreciate the effort he puts into things, this hard work will surely take you places. <br>Here's hoping that life gives you all that you deserve...<br><br>Cheers!!

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Kabra is infamous for asking far too many questions nearly always. But once, when I had a chat with him, he had something very interesting to say. He said that all his doubts are genuine and not just-for-the-heck-of-it as we think of it. Its that he has a lot of curiosity and cannot resist asking. Its to his credit that he has been this way all through the four years.<br><br>It is also to Kabra's credit that he had the tenacity to stay on when he did not get placed- beacuse he knew that he was good enough. Memories with Kabra include the all-Hyd trip in first year (during Dussera), CAT chats, watching him play football for the batch etc. <br><br>May you get all that you deserve!<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Angus from Two and a half men<br>Fav memory: First year trip<br>Message for him: Stay cool <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

If you club all the initial letters, you will get a word, "KABBU", a name given to him by me. One thing I like about him the most is his "PASSION". <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> If he has decided to achieve something, he will dedicate his soul and mind for it. And if anywhere, by any means, his purpose is getting fulfilled, he does not mind what others will think about him. And apart from this, the weirdest quality I find in him is his great liking for "HORROR" movies. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>If I have to describe him in one word, then I would say ..... "I can't describe him in one word, yaar!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but one thing I can say about him is that he is very good at heart and that might be the probable reason, why he has more girlfriends as compared to others in our batch" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><b> <br>Character he resembles: Sunil Shetty in 1 2 3 <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav.
