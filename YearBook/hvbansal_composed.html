Emotion thode jyada hai, thodi si baatein bhi dil pe le leta hai but aise dil ka bahut saaf hai. No hard feelings for anyone. <br><br>The kind of control that he has over his eating habits is wonderful. I learned a lot from him. In fact I tried leaving my favorite part of the food that is aaaalu (potato <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) just after seeing how he has not eaten it from god knows how many years. Doesnt eat after 10 p.m and wont eat at a place where there is non-veg cooked in the same kitchen. So, because of this we are always left with very few places in hyderabad where he can eat. He faces a lot of problems also because of this but still this does not change him. <br>Hats off for the self control buddy <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Now coming on to his last minute work ... For everything he has just one simple answer ..

<b>For <a href=abhinav_mehta.html>Abhinav Mehta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhinav is a down to earth and simple to understand person. Always meets you with a smile. His transition from very happy go lucky person to a serious researcher was almost sudden, at least for me. <br>A very good listener that is why a lot of people tell him a lot of things. This is the reason that he has a lot of gossip of others. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
