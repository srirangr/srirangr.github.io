<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>His tall, lanky figure and queer noise that he made with his mouth were the first things I remember about him. He was a regular visitor to my room in first and second year, especially between classes when he visited his other friends who lived in my neighborhood.<br>We shared our common liking for chikki and had a lot of chikkis at NBH shop.<br>He helped me many times with problems I faced in linux.<br>We both are equally enthusiastic to attend YOCS sessions and equally lazy not to go till Sec'bad to do so!! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>I love his sense of humor, its too intense sometimes and sometimes so dim that his face and his mannerism makes up for the rest of the humor. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I'll remember the most about this guy is his sense of humor, of course, and his attire, which is mostly a shirt hanging out and jeans, with his bag hanging on his right shoulder, and he walking with a peculiar rhythm in his movements... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Also his style of talking in which he's doing great with his speech, then suddenly he is unable to find a word, he waits, thinks, and then speaks, and yeah the way he drags the words when he speaks them. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>I remember him from first year when he used to mimic donald duck voice..<img src=Smileys/24.gif />...it is always fun to be with him...he is one of a kind...very sweet and simple he is .....whenever you meet him he will always greet you with a smile.....he is very innocent also...dunno how you are surviving in CVIT...<br>All the best yaar ...<br>I really hope you get out of cvit soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>You are simply awesome <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 5 and the most important part </b><br><br>I enjoyed myself a lot whenever I was with you buddy. All those mess sessions. And those post-mess campus walks during 2nd year holidays, legendary3.avi, those movies wathced with you in my room, those pics that we took with my cam in 4th year(gangsta rap pics, maar dala dance, fight sequence.. and many many more), those fights during SE presentation, those tutorials that you took for me in Networks, those movies that we watched in cinema-halls, those fagging sessions, those good old jogging times, those times when we learnt swimming, those moments when we went up on the roof top, those times when we played DumbC, those fights when you tried to teach me Linux fundae, those times when we went out to Subways, Domino's, Gur Nihal, those ramp walks <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, " Sanjana Marry Me ", those times when you climbed the trees to pluck some mangoes, those times when you learnt Bhargava's bike, those small yet rapid desicions that you take, all the BC that we did in our wing, the way you say "areeeyy yaaar", my collection of orkut chix-pics <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, that Military World Games incident, those awesome mails on life, those maggi eating sessions in my room and many many more. I'm gonna miss all these <b><i>choti-choti</i></b> things which makes life more beautiful. Yup buddy! you are the one. You are the one whom I'll miss the most when I leave this college. <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>I wrote down all those small small things in the testimonial coz in future if you ever got to see this testimonial you'll remember all the good old days and the ball that we had in these 4 years.<br><br><br>All the very best for your MS and for your future. Keep rocking.<br><br>Love.<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 4 </b><br><br>TV Shows. Dude, I must thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me watch "The Family Guy". <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. That's the best TV series that can ever be. OMG!! OMG!! Comedy and Sarcasm at its peak. Also, he made me watch HIMYM and today I'm a big fan of the show. That's about me. He watches wide variety of TV shows.<br><br>Daru. He was the first one who taught me how to drink, what to drink, what not to drink, How occasionally to drink etc etc.<br><br>Sports. Once he participated in 4x100 relay and won a bronze medal in it. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. No preparation, no practise. Direct hit. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Food. He brings awesome food from home. He has a great sense of Subs. It was him because of whom I started loving Subs. Otherwise I hated it.<br><br>This guy can crack any faaltu puzzle. This awesome talent of him was discovered on the day of Cache In '09. All the puzzles were useless and crappy but still he somehow came up with the answers. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He also helped me a lot during our placement time.<br><br>I sometimes wonder what I'd be like if I hadn't met him in IIIT. I think I'd like a dumbo.<br><br>So many good qualities, yet so humble and so downs-to-earth.<br><br>But there are a few qualities on which you should improve buddy. I'm not telling them to you here publically. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 3 </b><br><br>Linux. This guy is a linux kingu. He was always with me to help me learn any-fuckin-thing in linux and he never made me feel like I dunno any stuff about linux. Today, I'm quite comfortable using linux, but in the beginning it was very difficult. I didn't even know how to configure net and this guy has helped me a lot in many ways to make me feel comfortable using linux. Whoa! And today, I feel like linux is far far far better than the buggy windows. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>English. He speaks awesome English and is an expert in making use of idioms and phrases at the right moment. He has all the GRE words stored in a repository in his mind and quite oftenly he uses some of those words. Also, he writes awesome blog posts and poems. The way with which he manipulates the words brings a smile on everyone's face. Also, I was the main character in his English Literature story <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Movies. He watches many different types of movies and suggests me if any of them are good. Since we are talking about movies, I must say, we have a special relation when it comes to movies. Till today, whatever movie that we saw on my PC was awesome. Wait, lemme makea a complete list of the AWESOMEST movies that we saw together. 123 tops the list, Race, <i>Saawariya</i> ( <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ), Om Shanti Om, Flavours, Apna Sapna Money money, Vivah ( <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> again ), The Kite Runner, Shawshank Redemption, KungFu Panda, CC2C ( <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ), Gulaal, and many more. A complete movie freak.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>Now comes the music part. You won;t believe but I've never heard a single English song before coming to the college and by the end of 4 years I gave a performance on the most difficult song "Lose Yourself!!". I owe a veryyyyyyyy biiiiiiiiiig party to him for this. He was the first one to introduce me to rock. In the beginning, I never liked rock. But when I saw him singing the song with music in background, I too started reading the lyrics and today I know the lyrics of almost 500 English songs. But still on any arbit day, he'd come to my room and download an arbit song, which I've never heard of. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I dunno how come you manage to remember so many songs man! Today, whatever English songs that I have on my PC are by the courtesy of him and Siddu.<br><br>GK. This guy is a big time fodu in GK and quizzes. He never misses any quizzes. Very enthusiastic to conduct quizzes in the campus. Infact, he was also the Literary club coordinator and I got a credit from it. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Again, I must say he;s the chalta firta wikipedia. Be it current affairs or history or business or entertainment world (hollywood/bollywood) or gossip or for that matter p*rn stars too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, he remembers everything. Every goddamn thing about every goddamn guy/incident. And hence, he's got a big data to start a BC. He's a big BC baaz.<br><br>My next point is gonna be "Presentations". He makes the best presentations in IIIT. I've seen people asking him for the background image that he uses for presentations. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. I've learnt a lot about making nice presentations being with this guy. I startef using awesome quote lines and nice images and animation  in my prezo.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>Huh!! Finally a testimonial for the dearest friend of mine in IIIT. I know you wouldn't be expecting a testimonial from me at this last moment. But I couldn;t resist myself from writing one for you.<br><br>Sashi is hardworking, highly highly intelligent, enthusiastic, kiddish at times, ambitious, bada dilwala bhi hai. <br><br>Only people those who are close to him know that he craks awesome jokes. In fact, those jokes are sometimes so awesome that you literally do this => <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He used to crack such awesome jokes when we were in GHEB. Dunno what is the hub of all such jokes, but they are simblly Aahsome!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. These days because of the work load and all, he is not able to crack such awesome jokes. But still sometimes he craks such jokes once in a while.<br><br>I must thank him for showering on me the gyaan about books/novels. I never read any books till 2nd year. And then he comes to me and tells me about Harry Potter books. His way of narrating the story is also awesome. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Actually that was the reason for me to start reading the books. I started with Harry Potter/fantasy and today I read books of a wide variety of genres. But even today, my knowledge is negligible when compared to the living library <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I still read books suggested by him.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>A geek type of person ..coool mind .. and awesome fattebaaz...!! <br><br>He used to come in my room I mean ..scientist room because they both used to share lots of their kind of jokes...!! he's very nice person and down to earth ...and he jab bhi bolta hai haseen aati hai...!! <br><br>He's dedicated towards studies and alll ...!! <br><br>Well hope you do good in future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I've heard about Sashidhar's superb sense of humor even before I met him. Once, back in 1st year, we were walking back to hostel after some class. He saw the big rock near library and said "This is a perfect example of IIIT rocks". I was totally dumbstruck. This was the first joke I heard him say and thought "after all, what I heard abt him is not false" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> We kinda drifter apart in the next two years but back in the 4th <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has this typical way of talking and a characteristic gait with a bag slung down on one shoulder, stooped forward dragging himself down the road <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a very innocent guy and a child at heart. He just blabs anything that comes to his mind <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Many times, I've seen him lost in his own stream of thoughts. But when you are next to him he'll never let you get bored. He keeps entertaining me with his classic PJs <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I wish I knew more about this guy. Well...we have yet yanother year together. May be I will then. Good luck for your future Sashi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met this guy for the first time in workspace. The first real encounter was when he stole RAM from my PC. But instead of shouting at him (which I would have done under normal circumstances), I became friends with him and WE started stealing RAM together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It was one of the coolest venture I entered into in first year <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Slowly I came to know that he is damn good at Linux stuff. One of my very first inspirations to use linux comes from this guy. He would run around in workspace with a screw driver and open PCs randomly to exchange parts. I learnt tons of stuff about hardware/software from this guy in first year. I felt like a blessed one to have this guy as my batch-mate. I rarely feel bad about my crappy English and this is one of those moments. I wish I had access to all the +ve adjectives in this world and I could have used all of them for this guy <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Unfortunately we didn't talk much after first year, but he is still one of the few people I admire at IIIT. <br><br>Keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>You can just keep talking to him and never feel bored. He is well known for his PJs. Speaks innocently whatever comes to his mind. His mood swings a lot and that's something I really like about him - totally unpredictable. Amazing story narrator but the stories are a bit geeky. I just love his blogging style. Loved your "series of fortunate incidents in Bangalore" post. I still keep reading it whenever I find free time. Is so creative at times, leaves me dumbstruck. He knows these awesome hangout points which no one has ever been before. Thanks to the Quiz Club I came to know more about him. Just too good when it comes to quizzing <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Any college event would be incomplete without you. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Thanks for being such a wonderful Friend. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> So when are we coming to your place for Lunch? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=shashankl.html>shashank lagishetty</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Discussion forum in IIIT-H in 2011 is going on a sunny sunday in music room headed by Deepti Mishra Ma'm. <br><br>Deepti Ma'm: hi, howz life in iiit? <br><br>freshers: fine!!! rocking!!! awesome!!! nice!!!! f***ing(...whisper...)!!! great!!!<br><br>DM: ok...today we will discuss about "Sashidhar"<br><br>2nd,3rd,4th year students: Oh ma'm thats a rocking topic, these freshers need to know about him.<br><br>DM: ya thats why sangal sir asked me to discuss about his greatness with freshers.<br><br>freshers: who is this sashidhar ma'm??<br><br>DM: "Sashidhar", what can I say about him!!! he is a gem of a person. There are several kinds of relaxations like listening to music, sleeping etc...but talking to him also gives you the same pleasure as if sleeping for 8 hours( because his CG is 8).<br><br>freshers: oh...how does he do that?<br><br>DM: similar to DVS karna, he got PJing, pleasant expressions by birth. Everyone wants to hang-out with him. 2,3,4th year students do you want to share something?<br><br>2,3,4: Ya ma'm, we are honoured to interact with him. We heard about him from his friends and read his testimonials from yearbook and found that <br>	1) He is a great friend who never said no when friends reach him for help.<br>	2) All his batch mates are very very found of his jokes.<br>	3) He is very strong in Linux, graphics, coding.<br>	4) Some of his pics are very hilarious. you can see them in orkut.<br>	5) He is very good at talking with girls. He once asked the name of the senior on whom he had crush.<br><br>south freshers: Wait, Wait...are you telling about "Tyson" character in "Happy Days"<br><br>2,3,4: Ya, we know you will ask that. His friends tried to drag shekhar kammula(director of that movie) to court for potraying his character without his permission. But sashidar being a good person stopped them from doing so.<br><br>freshers: How much similarity exist betwen tyson and sashi??<br><br>2,3,4: Almost 100% except his hair. <br><br>girl freshers: Thinking...(Shit, why didn't we born 3 years before, we could have enjoyed a lot with him).</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=shashankl.html>shashank lagishetty</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>DM: I know what you are thinking...Dont worry...we will call him to Alumni Meet this year but be careful, he will flat you.<br><br>freshers: what is he doing now?<br><br>DM: Now, he is in ********** company.<br><br>2,3,4: Ya, thats a dream company for many of us.<br>(bell rings) Everyone dispers<br><br>girl freshers: sir, how can we meet him? do you have his pics?<br><br>2,3,4: There are many batch mates of him still doing MS. for example s******k, meet him. If he is impressed he will arrange a private talk.<br><br>girl freshers: Thank you Thank you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Sashidhar aka Sashi</u><br><br>Awesome banda hai bhai... Its always so much fun talking to him or even looking at him, he would always keep entertaining you with all his antics. Famous for his PJs which transcend all the limits and force you to bang your head on the wall and yet he wouldnt stop and keep telling you more. A very bhola-bhala insan, one of the most innocent beings in college, at times you are left amused by his innocence and simplicity. His unique style of speaking is always a delight to listen, will never forget the way he said to Prof. Zulu "<b>Sir! Sir!! Sir!! </b>	I want to say this <b>Sir</b>, that <b>Sir</b> what you are saying <b>Sir</b>" (and I lost track after that, was ROFLing so hard <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ). He is an oxymoron of sorts, lazy enough not to work and yet dedicated enough not to take projects under Ramu or any such prof. He wants to get a MS degree without doing much work and yet he chose CVIT, the lab which is famous for its workload <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Have always liked the random ramblings of his on his blog and specially the poems of his <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Another interesting about him is his stories of the girls, every few months or so, he would have a new crush (and that too in IIIT, bow to thee man) and the innocent way in which he would tell you the stories would just make you ROFL. The <b>slapgate</b> incident with one girl in his building is a classic example of this <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best for your MS!! Stay in touch.<br><br><b>Most Memorable Moment : That incident in ZUlu's class <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking man..</b></i></ul><br><br>

He is not a disciplined person but he can work hard when he is determined.<br><br>He loves listening to the strangest of rock music on the earth.

I <i>toh</i> seriously think he can become a very fine play writer  I am one big fan of the way he starts off a conversation - his so called pickup lines - "Hey, are you using this PC" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , "Hey, is this your coffee cup" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and such similar stuff..<br><br>I can go on and on talking about you Sashi, but let me end here as it is getting too long.

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[part 2]</b><br>      The way we entered GE campus stealthily, without anybody noticing me, well because I was not allowed inside GE, because I did not work there <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . The 'out'ing we had the next day.. We covered the whole Bangalore in one freaking day..It was so much fun hanging out with him. Coming back to campus, we started hanging out literally every day.. The endless <i>sollu</i> sessions in CVIT labs, we go there only under the pretext to work, but no we don't.. We draw stuff on the green board in the lab, we engrave our names on the desks, we play games on the big screen, we steal bournvita from the pantry <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We screen movies and arrange for popcorn and biryani for <b>gangsta</b> ..in short, we do absolute jobless stuff in that lab.. Its our <b>adda</b>, a meet up point for our gang... <br><br>     I get kicked by the other gangstas all the time for supporting and encouraging Sashi's PJs. Well, he is soo adorable, I can't heeeelp eeet.. He is superbly creative. he has got this overwhelmingly amazing brain.. His knowledge about books and authors and their interesting life-stories is <i>keka</i> . I bow low before you, Lord Sashidhar for your ahhsome tech knowledge...<br><br>     He is the guy with whom I dont have to think twice before I blurt something out..Its easy, words flow out when Sashi is around. He is the biggest victim of all the homo jokes I crack..His Telugu is so bad that I think Koduri would want to kick the bucket <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He has a list of all the things that annoy me the most and whenever we all meet, he starts off "Okay, here is something for pissing Deepti off" and just goes ahead with those things in his list.. The innumerable number of totally awesome chats <i>(khaane waale)</i>,samosas, jalebi outings we had, the long walks in the campus, the way we both once stalked a girl <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> [well, I was just giving him company]..     I cannot forget the ahhsome chat[baat-cheet] we had - it was sharat,ranga,bee,sashi v/s me .. It was totally awesome - one of the best chats any brain can ever ever churn out.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part1]</b><br><Slum dog millionaire style><br><br>Q) Who amongst your friends is the most adorable one?"<br> a) Person X b) Person Y c)Sashidhar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> d) None of the above.<br><br>Well, I smiled, yet another time. This is one question for which I do not have to think twice. I replied "But ofcourse it is Sashi". Option (c)<br><br><i>Are you sure?</i><br><br><b>Yes I am.</b><br><br> ----x- --- <br><br>And it was then, I woke up from my dream.. Dream it was, but the answer wouldn't change if somebody asks me the same question at any point of time..<br><br>I know , i know, you must be thinking - <i>natak baazi</i> right? You cannot but agree with me, if you know Sashi well.<br><br>        k k k k k k k (I say, sing it in a tune) thats how Sashi aka moony reacts when we talk to him.. I had no idea who he was, well except for through Anu for one helluva incident <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Ask him what was the password of his PC in first year <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Then suddenly PJN shoots a mail asking me,tifozi and Sashidhar to come meet him.. We went, we met him, his talk was one OHT approximately 20 feet above my head which implies 15.5 feet above Sashi's head.. We were assigned the same honors project and thats how we became praaaject paartners.<br><br>        Our working styles were totally different.. Me being okay, lets get this thing done right away, and he being - okay lets take it slow and be perfect in every possible detail.. A blend of both these is what I so proudly call, even as God PJN himself puts it as  - one of the finest works in CVIT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <b><i>[self dabba]</i></b> Sashi, I seriously apologize for constantly bugging you about the project, I was well, crazy back then.. After the whole honors project crap got over, that the Felicity work began and we became real good friends and then really close buddies.. We were in Bangalore together for internship and the time we have spent there, although was less, was awesome..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br><b>A word about Sashi the person.</b> The most helpful, sweet-natured guy you will ever come across. A gem of a guy that way. A perfect modern Brahmin, I would say. High on intellect, high on virtues, high on austerity and very open-minded and eager to learn and embrace all good things from others and their culture. A gem of a person. It will be very interesting to follow his life path. I have high expectations that he will add a breathe of fresh air to riff raff of this world. <br><br><b>Wish I had spent </b>more time with you guys in our BTech, but I guess some things always look simpler in the hindsight.

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><br><b>Poetry is a way of life. </b>You have to live poetry to create  poetry. People choose that particular way of life. But Sashi is a natural. Hats off to the one who I believe is the most natural poet among the people of our age I've ever met.<br><br>Interest in literature, a keen eye for things, a good literary circle, but most importantly, the guts to sit alone and explore his feelings, to go beyond the obvious and the accepted and see things on his own. He sees depth where there is none for others. Combine all this with the fact that he has a slightly different way of looking at things (refer to his 'laziness' poem) and a slightly different one of expressing them too, and the confidence that that's all right, makes him a very complete poet. <br><br>Fortunately or unfortunately, apart from being a natural poet, Sashi is a natural geek as well. So there goes poetry out of the window, I suppose. It's sad to see such talent remaining unused, but then of course it's your, and nobody else's prerogative. Hats off to such width and depth of talent! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br><b>I know that I keep </b>saying (and writing) things to you which I suspect you might not have liked. e.g. for some of your depressing poems, I ask you to keep them coming. For a story on which people write comments with the intention to probably 'heal' the depression, I say that it was a well-written one. That's because poets treat all kinds of emotions, timid, brave, happy or sad as just emotions. Objectively. What I appreciated in your posts was the expression, rather than the emotion itself. It was Aniket the critic rather than Aniket the friend. I hope you see the distinction.<br><br><i>Contd.</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>To begin with he was my roommie in 2nd year and needless to say that was the best time I had in IIIT, I learnt a lot of things from him. I never came across a person who has more G.K than him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, ofcourse  there exits another guy I will describe him afterwards. we had done lots of stuff together, remember we used to play NFSMW in our room, and those awesome rasna drinks and britannia mary cake chocolate/vanilla flavour which we used to have<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>we used to have competition while doing our assignments especially graphics. He has a lot of interest in graphics which i noticed when we were doing those<br>assignments and he had also won our felicity08 game designing contest. I didn't had the habit of reading books and it was he who helped me in doing so. I used borrow books from him, he used to recommend books for me based on my ability.<br><br>I will never forget those hang outs and funny experiences, wanna have a drink ??? he never replied no to me. It was in our 3-2 i guess we had developed this habit.He kinda fallen in love with his cellphone  recently and been taking care of it day n ni8.<br><br>He also has this disease of changing decisions in a split second, I hope u overcome this and be more confident while taking decisions.I hope u will finish M.S here as soon as possible, I wish u the gud luck for ur future .</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Long long ago, a lad named Young Sash wrote a book called "Fattaa?!". It caused ripples, a chain of events like the falling of dominoes happened as the summers turned into springs and the winters turned into falls . Some of the randomly selected ones are:<br><br>a) When the Great Ravana narrated a fatta from sashi's book to Hanuman Ji, he got so angry, so angry that he set the beautiful city of Lanka ablaze (mataash! ante). All the residents of Lanka were like "Bhaag bedu, andi aayeee". You get the picture.<br><br>b) Ganguly happened to sunao-fy some of the fattas from the book to Greg Chapell. The next scene - Gangu out of the effin' cricket team.  <br><br>c) The day Hitler committed suicide, reds found his book lying beside the fuhrer.<br><br>d) Apna wasted dope, arey Kurtu Cobainu. Guess, why did he go for excessive intake of drugs, by the twist of fate, he happened to leaf through some of the journal entries of young sash. sad, no?<br><br>e) aaactually, whaat happened with benjamin button was, when he was a child, his nani from buttinda, punjab read him some of the lines from sashi's book. bas lag gayi, button ki! button's mind got dead-locked and all sorts of weird bull happened with him.<br><br>f) aur yaad nahi aa rahe hai re. apne bana lo yaar. toh! The ultimate answer to life, universe and everything - sashi ke fatte. <br><br>Nowadays, he is talking the British Accent -  bloke kate, kuch kuch ki baata karah eno (I even assured him a job in the Satyam Call Center, he is not stopping though, bummer!)<br><br>chalo, mere taraf se sab khariet, cya!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sashidhar is an awesome person who is a lot of fun to be with. He is one of those who can crack jokes as well as PJs (hes renowed for the latter) with a straight face! He acts very funny sometimes, but can really surprise you with his levels of knowledge of a lot of fields. In fact, he makes for a very good quizzer. I must also mention that I really enjoy some of his blog posts- They'r pretty imaginative and humorous. The enthusiasm he has for literary stuff is <br>amazing.. I remember Sharat and him frequenting Yorks. <br><br>My favourite memory with him would be Felicity and its aftermath. He was responsible for guest lectures, and I remember how much I would irritate him to get the work done. I also remember that the night after Felicity, when we were sloshed, I said something to him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Now I don't remember exactly what (I remember being a little apologetic); but I must tell you that you've done some brilliant work for Felicity- Sorry if I was ever rash during those days <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best in life buddy, May you taste the sweet honey of success.<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Jughead from Tintin comics<br>Fav memory: Getting sloshed after Felicity '08<br>Message for him: Be more confident about yourself and whatever you do.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>yeah! right. Sashidhar the oldest guy according to age, and the youngest according to behavior in our gangsta gang ! <br><br>He is a big fattebaz, and cracks PJs day in and day out! The best quality in this guy is that he is up for fun/raccha at any time of the day. He would come to a party even if he has a submission on the very next day ! He is very sensitive and is kind of moody. He has a huge thing for Blondes esp Scarlet Johanson. <br><br>  This guy is a huge fantasy freak, you can read his english literature story and you will understand what I mean. He is also a quizzer, loves to read pages and pages of Wikipedia and on the same time drooling over Superficial <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>   All in all a great guy to be friends with <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . He is one of the most helpful guys in IIIT ! <br><br>I just hope he gets out here very quickly and comes to bangalore to bang-'lore's <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  <br><br>Note to him :- You need to prioritize things and need to stick to them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
