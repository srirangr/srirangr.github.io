<b><a href=vrktavva.html>Tavva Rajesh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>lydia... she is a very very very nice girl !!<br>i have never seen someone so sincere, so caring, and so nice to others <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>she doesn't at all like hurting anyone. even if by chance someone gets hurt by her, she feels extremely guilty about it <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>she walks as if she runs <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>a very good throwball player <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>and above all very good at heart <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>all the best for ur MS and ur future ahead <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Lydia Manikonda...The first words that heard her say were "Please don't make fun of my name" to a senior during interaction session. She is the Ms.Keep-my-room-clean of our batch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Everything in her room has to be in the right place and sparklingly clean - and this rule is pertained only to her room (remember the cake on the wall lyddi?? <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> There was this one incident when she accidentally stepped on a dog in front of GH. You won't believe what she did - she asked me to get dettol from her room, cleaned her feet in the common bathroom and only after that did she go into her room <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> She even has this "Please leave your footwear outside" note on her door <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> And when she walks she walks like she runs <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> This might give some people an impression that she is one of that serious kinda breed. Noooo...she is actually a sweetheart. She always has this a very pleasant smile and always greets you whenever you cross paths with her however busy she might be.We had some great times playing badminton in the 1st yr. I don't actually remember why we stopped playing but she blames me for that <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Also the trip to Bombay was a very memorable time we had with all jokes about the rooms, trains and the photo session we had in the conference hall. It was just too good <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Initially, she a liiiittttle conservative but her trip to Australia has made her a super cool gal. She is very sincere in every work she does. She doesn't copy her assts <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> , she is the only one that I know of who is against the proxy policy <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> She is always enthusiastic to learn new things. And yeah...she is a very good throwball player <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>     I wish you aaaalll the very best future plans. Love you lots lyddu <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hehe when it comes to tension she can dominate anybody <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> the ultimate tension master. She always has a worried face idi avaledu aa assignment avaledu <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. But i really admire her guts to do an internship in Australia all on her own. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I hope that you finalize your research topic soon. All the best for your MS. Pudi sir keka just believe him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>From what i know .. she is a very hard working girl and sensitive at heart. Ready to help others in need.<br>She takes her acads far too seriously. She always greets me with a smile on her face when ever we meet although its rare ..<br>sorry if i am wrong in any of the above .. but, all the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>PART II <br><br>We have done many other courses together like DWDM, WDKM and Industry and Society. Whatever course it might be, we always worked together on every course project... and we had lots of fun in the classes pulling other's legs <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and sometimes each other's too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Btw, Lyddu is always ready to tease and irritate shalini all the time for no reason <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All in all, Lyddu is simple and sweet. She is an epitome of cleanliness. She has this cute little smile on her face all the time. She always says, "I like seeing everyone around me bearing a simple smile on their face. I feel sad if someone among my friends looks unhappy" <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> One can learn a lot from her.<br><br>She is always there for me... I just move to her room along with my lappy whenever I feel lonely or get bored. She says "My room door is always open for you dear <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ".We both have spent some most memorable times together. She was the one who always encouraged me when it comes to pursuing MS. She always enacts how I would change after an year or two and that sounds too funny <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I can't call this just friendship for it has lots of trust and affection too <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Thankyou Lyddu for all the care and love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Can never forget the walks, all the night stays in your room and all the fun we had these four years.<br><br>Last but not the least, here are few strict instructions to be followed if you want to stay in the near viscinity of Lydia <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>a) Read all the instructions from the list pasted on her door before you enter her room.<br><br>b) Don't you dare to walk into her room with your chappal on <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br><br>c) Wash your hands and legs with dettol immediately even if you find some tiny dust particle on the tips <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>d) Never try to talk some non-sense and waste your time when she is around.<br><br>Tried to make it as short as possible. Will miss you loads Lyddu <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Will miss someone whom I can immediately go to when I have something to share <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Sorry if I hurt you anytime. I wish to see you soon in US. Will be waiting for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your MS and PHD too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Love you dear <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Do you know what one of my friends said to me when I keep telling him about Lydia and the special relationship we share?? He said, "You should have such a friend from your first year itself <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> " and that says it all about lyddu...<br><br>To start off with....<br><br>Sanskrit Course:<br><br>   We used to sit beside each other in the class, note down every single point discussed in the class and then make many plans to study it that day itself with a sincere wish of getting an 'A' <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>   Do you what happens if a lecturer sees a student even turning his/her head during the lecture?? According to Lyddu, the student's grade will stoop down 2-3 levels <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> I was literally shocked and also awestruck when she told this to me in Sanskrit class. But then you know we get habituated to her out-of-the-world theories <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Honors - I:<br><br>   Well, four of us girls actually decided to work under Prof.Vikram Pudi and as two of the four had plans to work together, me and Lyddu are all smiles to be each other's partner <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I am really happy we decided to work together Lyddu <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>   We both made plans to work from the very first day on which Sir assigned the project <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and used to bug him every now and then possible. It took us 2-3 months to decide on the topic <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and then as always we were asked to work on the same for our BTP too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>BTech Project:<br><br>   Here it is... All through the tough days we had coding for our project, she has been so patient in waking me up every 10-15mins <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I make this "5mins sleep request" often and then she starts saying "ok navs gnite <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> " (with all the pun intended). I then say, "I have set the alarm Lyddu. I will definitely wake up in few mins <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ".<br> <br>   She used to get pretty tensed before the VIVA. I, as her BTP partner, have always made my sincere effort to boost up confidence in her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We have somehow successfully completed our project and now are eagerly waiting for the grades to be out...<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>very very hardworking and dedicated girl.<br><br>In first year her PC was just beside mine. I used to do all racha racha in workspace but she never complained about anything. Very very patient and down to earth girl.<br><br>Also she was the only girl in A4 but she was more conservative and reserved so she didn't speak much during the English classes. But even then it was fun.<br><br>It was for once that I shared stage with her and I thank her from the bottom of my heart for letting me sing those prayers on the eve of Christmas. It was real fun. All those practices and posters thing will always remind me of you.<br><br>Isn't it obvious that she;s a Kasi candidate. Coz she got converted to dual <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Well, all the very best for your MS and future as well. Keep rocking<br><br>Srirang <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I take the honor of writing a testimonial for my best buddy .<br><br>Well knowing her for a long period of 7 years makes me confused .. how to start off a testimonial and end it in compact . I can write a big book on her that describes how close we are an how much she means to me .<br><br>Her name .. swirls in most of the mouths .. as 'Very Hard working girl ' .. and thats how I came to know her in the beginning .. later we became clasmates , benchmates ,  roommates !! . Hmm .. well it was tough in the beginning .. I remember all the cold wars and silly fights we had about the weekend test ranks <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I loved your competitive spirit ya ! . I never thought that we would end up at a same place for Btech .<br><br>I could see lot of change in lydu after coming to IIIT .. the most caring , loving , funny , sweet , emotional (all senti and sweet kinda adjectives may not be sufficnet here to describe her as she is that adorable love u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> ). <br><br>She's the one who first comes into my mind whenever I want to share any happy or a sad thing . A rare combo of great things ! .<br><br>Easily gets angry on simple things and sometimes she's follishly stubborn on stupid things . (I was victim mant times in this case <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ).<br><br>Love you lyddu .. Im def gonna miss you spending wonderful time wid you .<br><br>All the best for your future and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>       Laddu is how i call her and its only me who calls her that way.. She loves when I call her so and smiles warmly everytime we cross our ways (which is quite rare, 'coz I am a noctural and she is a perfect lark) <br><br>        A bigg fan of my curls.. Everytime she sees me, she says "aww.. i love your hair.." and I say - "awww i wish you were a guy <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> " Kidding.. <br><br>         She has changed a lot during her stay here in -H. From a silent, serious girl in first year to a light hearted girl who is always set to give bumps to Spandana for no tangible reason.. I never really got this - why lydia, why do you always want to kick poor Spandy?? Why not Navatha, why not Shalini.. It should be Navs the next time. You know, she was the only girl who was pushing and encouraging everybody to kick me during my birthday <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>      The awesome birthday celebrations we had in your room, the cake which your parents get is awesome re.. Please tell me where they get it from.. I will regularly visit that bakery <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>       Its only during EPP presentation that we actually worked together.. Being in totally different streams does effect your interaction sometimes..But she being Navs project partner and me and Navs being quite close.. She has had her share of difficulties half of them being waking Navs up when she is sleeping <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>     You think I am a  serious girl <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Wohhh my gawddzz, no laddu <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>     I wish you all the very best in future and may you reach the greatest heights <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Contrary to popular belief, Lydu is an absolute fun person in her own unique way <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. As much as I admire her for her sincerity and ethics, her obsession for cleanliness (she could give Monica a complex) and animated movies (esp Kung fu panda <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) always ends up becoming a point of debate!! I have been trying to get her to watch a movie in a cinema for 4 years without any success. I give up Lydu <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>     Will fondly remember the awesome walks and talks, doing assignments(at least that's what we intended to do <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) in your room, slumber partys, birthday bashes etc for a long time. Her internship period in Australia kinda transformed her and shes become much more relaxed and outgoing now. A patient listener,caring pal and discipline preacher <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, Lydu you are a wonderful person, a wonderful friend and am sure will become a wonderful teacher too <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. All the best for your future plans and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
