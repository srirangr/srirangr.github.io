<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sweet girl...but a bit shy...never got an opportunity to know you...<br><br>All the best for your future though <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first met Shalda at NIT, Warangal during AIEEE counselling. "Calm and Innocent" was the very first impression she left on me. And then at IIIT, we were the two who were given the two corner most rooms in opposite wings in the 2nd floor while all our batch girls occupied those in the 3rd floor. And that is how we both started being together....<br><br>She moved to my opposite room few months ago..Since then, we started freaking out very often.. We both have some similar interests too. Liking for all the road-side masala food, watching all the tv shows and reality shows, etc.. Be it going to the paratha point or the pani puri or the chinese waala, we both will definitely be there in the gang <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Keeping aside all the fun, She is one big "KASI" at Studies. Good at programming and also very sincere in completing her work on time <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>And now we both are into the same company <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I wish I join along with you Shals <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But its ok.. It will become difficult for them to handle two great brains together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Just do some wonders there and let the company make some huge profits... All the very best Shals <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Luv u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and will miss all those walks, chinese waala visits and especially someone who walks straight into my room whenever my room door is open.. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Shalda is the name given to her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> She is one of my best buddies. The time we had together was awesome and so memorable. <br>I can memorize all the funny things we've done together. We both share many similar qualities especially in the food sense <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>We've started interacting with each other during our project under Mr.Pingali <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> in our 2nd yr. From that time till today we stayed together as good frends. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>I always pull her leg and irritate her the most but everytime she take so lightly and stays beside me. <br>During fourth yr we became very close friends. Our wonderful discussions and the type of stupid questions she used to ask me... I'll miss them <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Shez very very cool.<br>I never believed that she will eat in Yukthahaar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Once upon a time she used to dislike the food made in Yukthahaar but the summer session has brought a gr8 change in her. Also she started recently, spending most of her time watching movies and TV shows <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> which are making us very angry. Whenever we call her for lunch or dinner, she always say 5 mins( and 5 mins in her language means 1 hr or more than that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ).<br>Our new attempts and discoveries everything am gonna miss Shalda <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Hope we'll be together. I had an awesome time with you and am gonna miss you a lot buddy <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>Luv u loads sweetheart.</b></i></ul><br><br>
