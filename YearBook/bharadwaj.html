<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bharadwaj, we were unfortunate not to have you in OBH <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I have interacted with him couple of times but never felt that we are someone diff from each other at all. Last year after i had refused to go on batch trip, it was worth appreciating his efforts in makin a batch trip but unfortunately because of college policies it could not happen. Sometimes I feel sorry for my decision too. <br><br>I remember the day when he came to me this year and asked me 'sanket will plan trip this year' I was glad with his gesture.<br><br>He is polite, never seen him angry, friendly and i am impressed by his simplicity of thoughts.<br><br>Man be the same and haan don't forget me.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>First year: I came to know he was my partner in ece project ...and he never showed up <img src=Smileys/14.gif />...other one being saurabh...who didn come either <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br>Third Year: Campaigning core committee meeting, arguing with him, on how to campaign, when to send posters...etc.<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.But it was fun working with you guys <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is committed to his work and member of our batch cricket team <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>All the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>"Rohit".. is such a sweet simple name. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>On the very first day of IIIT, when I stepped out of the auto, I saw a guy who was just like me in proportions and with a chubby face, specatcles and all. That was Rohit.<br><br>Well, we didn;t speak for the first two years. The reasons mailnly behind these being that we were in different sections or in different hostels. But we came quite close during the series of cricket matches in 2nd year Summers. And today, I feel proud to have met Rohit and wished, I'd have known him earlier.<br><br>He's a great bowler, a very very great fielder, a great batsman, basically an allrounder in cricket. He also plays Volleyball quite decently. Also, he's an awesome organizer. I remember that we were the guys who had planned for the batch trip 08, but unfortunately, because of the low response, we had to give up.<br><br><br>Now, some of the qualities that I've noted in this guy. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's got authoritative command over all and has the an awesome power of making people work <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Quite a rare quality. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Dude, I guess you should try MBA. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I can see a great future of yours there. He might not be knowing many languages, but I've never seen a communication gap in his way of communication. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Well, because of the time constraint, I guess, I might have to stop it here. <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Will miss you a lot man! Keep rocking as ever,(and I know you will <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) and all the very best for your future.<br><br>Love<br>DJ Ranga<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>i have known rohit for 6 years now...he was my classmate right from 11th nd 12th...we never used to talk to each other back then...but i remember he always used to wear this red shirt....after coming to iiit he was a few roll no.s next to me...always used to wear polo neck shirts and keep his pen in his mouth and used to give a wierd stare...i never used to speak to him...thinking he must be an introvert...then after 2nd year he added me on gtalk...we used to have long chats...3/4th of his chats have "<img src=Smileys/1.gif />" this smiley ...right from then we started becoming good frnds ...he is nice to talk to and is helpful...always wid his gang...i call the gang a train and all its members its boogies <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... we anyway have one more year ....all the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>        We never spoke nor did I know any about Rohit before Samvedana. He has been quite an active member right from the first meeting he attended. All I know of  him is through the meetings and discussions we have about Samvedana. He is sharp, very intelligent and very difficult to convince on any point, one of the strongest critic of the decisions made for Samvedana - a trait which is very important for SAM to grow . Of what I have got to know of him, he is quite a stud in acads (through your constant complaints about workload <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), caring about his family and friends and is quite practical, completely crazy about cricket <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , I think he bows before Sachin daily in the morning when he gets up <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He has worked a lot for Felicity'08, for batch trip and now for Samvedana  <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>      With you in team, I am confident that Samvedana will grow bigger and spreads its wings far and wide. Wishing you loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Right arm fast bowler over/around the wicket, faculty quarters end. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Eat Cricket, Sleep Cricket and Drink Cricket - thats Rohit Bhardwaj. One of the best persons I have met during my stay at IIIT Hyderabad (thanks to Srikar that I came to know him and his group). He speaks well and gives some awesome/amazing ideas when asked for. Provokes the minds of the person on the other end (makes the other person think). I strongly believe he should pursue his career in politics. He keeps pointing at the loopholes in the present/past government systems and gives his opinion on tackling those issues - which fits in properly. With your presence in team-samvedana, I am sure we can reach heights quickly. An all-rounder in both Cricket and Engineering. Had the raccha moments of my life in NBH in organizing Felicity and attending Bday treats.<br><br>People say we look like brothers <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Anyways Good luck with your future endeavors. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>ROhit aka Rohit <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></u><br><br>G. Rohit Bharadwaj, thats what his name says, which has been a big source of confusion for me <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> The first time I heard his name, I was confused how could this guy be from Andhra, I was hell bent on believing that he must be from North, coz even I am a Bharadwaj brahmin. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Faltoo points aside, it has been a pleasure interacting with him, the very few times we have interacted <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> A fellow Sachin fan, fellow blogger and a member of batch cricket team. I will always remember the sixes he hit in a maatch against UG2k6, one of the most memorable match <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Talking about blogging, at times people say that he and me are blogging brothers. Our styles of writing are quite similar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All in all a nice guy, its been my pleasure knowing you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The best thing about the guy is that he will always greet you with a smile on his face. I remember my blog used to have the title <b>Ever Smiling</b>, I think it should be his blog that should have that title. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Wishing you all the best for your future. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>A very dedicated cricketer.. I have seen him skipping breakfast, lunches for the sole purpose of playing well during the match... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>He gives his 100% while playing volleball too. we played for the batch and being in the same house we played for house too. We won silver and i have to say without him it wouldn't have been possible to get that medal. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. I still remember the way he took the lead when i was tensed and the safe-play strategy that we adopted successfully to win the matches.  <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>I will always remember your work during Felicty'08. <br><br>I'm sure you will complete the thesis by 2010.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first met Rohit during cricket practise sessions for Aakash House in my first year. I remember him as this fodu bowler, whereas my balls were being sprayed left, right and center. During the first two years, Rohit along with Pagare formed a potent new ball combination both for Aakash and the batch. They were pretty good together- I even remember Rohit taking the ball away from the right hander. And then there is his lusty hitting- on his day, he can whack any bowler out of the park. Add to that his brilliant outfielding, and you have a very good cricketer. Its a little sad that his bowling lost the edge in third year, but he kept working on his game (he has worked quite hard for it.. would attend all the practise sessions) and is coming close to his top form slowly. If that happens in the finals, then God bless UG3!<br><br>Rohit has also been very active in the other aspect of college affairs. He was one of the major guys behind Felicity '08. He had so much enthu that he not just did his duty as the finance ka member, but also contributed hugely to the campaigning and hospitality department. Actually, he was quite suited to these roles as Rohit is essentially a very soft spoken and down to earth chap. If Rishi was this iffy strict guy in the finance council, Rohit was the one who <br>would use the balm to good effect <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He did brilliant work for the campainging dept.. In fact it was his entire wing working hard together for Felicity '08. I'll also remember him one of the pioneers of Samavedana, an organisation which has started to take very good shape now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers mate, and wish you all the very best!<br><br><b><br>Person he resembles: Lance Klusener<br>Fav memory: Discussions about Felicity finances <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Message for him: Be more assertive.<br></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
