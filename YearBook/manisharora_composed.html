<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul aka Chaddami aka Atal aka Rock<br><br>Atul bhai apne ultimate cool bande hain. Batch ke sabse bade bcbaaz ka khitaab without any doubt Atul ko hi jana chahiye. I still remember my first year clearly when he used to be a bond in "Mortal Kombat" lekin mujhse haar jaata tha. Hota kya tha ki mujhe dhang se khelna nahi aata tha aur main jaldi jaldi kuch bhi keys press karta rehta tha, bechare ko meri strategy samajh nahi aati thi aur haar jata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . This guy is multitalented. Mast guitar bajata hai .... hamare college ke rock band mein hai .... achcha basketball bhi khelta hai .... tabla bajata hai .... gaata bhi hai .... CS bhi khelta hai .... aur sabse badi baat, itna bada bcbaaz hai. Orkut par kuch bhi photo aaye, kisi ki bhi photo aaye, Atal bhai ke comments us par zaroor milenge. BC forum par PJ section mein to kya hi BC ki thi inhone. Aur aajkal to khud ki p**n stories bana kar logon ko sunate hain. Jab isne pehli baar mujhe sunai to meri hasi hi control nahi ho rahi thi. Seriously, this guy is damn creative. Main ise admire karta hun <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .... ab majak mein nahi yaar, main seriously tujhe bahut admire karta hun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. You are a very confident guy jisko kabhi bhi koi bhi kaam karne se darr nahi lagta aur jise lagta hai that some day or the other, he'll definitely succeed in that task, a quality worth embedding. Keep rocking rockingatul. May God bestow the showers of happiness and success upon you. Keep in touch. Bhai ko bhoolna mat. Tumhari bc ko main bahut miss karne vala hun, isiliye time to time bc karne aate rehna apne yahan. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Maruti Borker aka P-Com aka gilly aka Billu aka 1049 aka .....<br><br>I call him 1049 and he calls me 1048 as our roll nos are 1048 and 1049. Shuru mein to isne kabhi mujhe naam se bulaya hi nahi, hamesha 1048 hi bolta rehta tha. This guy is a geek when it comes to techie stuff. A genuine bond with a very sharp mind and hard-working attitude on the things of his interest. Mujhe jab bhi apne pc par kuch problem aati thi, main apne labcom ki jagah isse ya Adi se hi poocta tha. Isi ne mere pc par mplayer install kiya tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Ise C-programming karte dekh kar pata chal jata tha that how sharp he is and how quickly he grasps the things. We spent some quality time in workspace where his pc was quite popular and we used to have a lot of his visitors in our area <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Classes mein ise kabhi jaagte hue nahi dekha, hamesha sota hi rehta tha. Hamesha hasta rehta hai. Choti-2 baat par bhi zor-2 se typical Maruti style mein hasta tha. Always ready to help, thanks a lot for all the help you provided to me in workspace buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. You are a genuine bond associated with the quality of being down-to-earth with a nice smile which always remain present on your face. Have the same attitude in your life. Keep up the good spirit. Sincerely hope that you make it very big some day. May God give you all the success and happiness in your life. Cheers to our friendship. Keep in touch and keep calling. Bengaloru jakar bhool mat jaiyo. <br><br>Cheers <br>Manish<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kulbir Saini aka Chacha aka Dollar bhai<br><br>Is bande ke liye bahut jyada respect hai mere dil mein. Chaar saal tak isne sirf apne interest par kaam kiya hai aur aage bhi karne vala hai. Baki cheezon ki sabki aisi ki taisi, ye nahi karne vala. I seriously admire him for what he is doing and the way he is doing that. Linux mein isse bada bond nahi dekha hoga.  Bcbaaz bhi hai bahut bada. Har ek ki leta rehta hai poore time. Volleyball to alag hi tarah se khelta hai. Poora Haryanvi jor iska volleyball mein nazar aata hai. CS bhi jab bhi khelo ye banda join karta hi hai. Coffee Shop iska mandir hai. Har time vahin par milega ye banda. This guy is damn intelligent and hard-working. His placement in Rediff is a testimony to this fact. I wish you all the luck for ur future buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hope you start a company and that becomes a big hit some day. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sambhav aka Tinka aka GenX<br><br>What an allrounder he is !! Har kaam karta hai banda aur bilkul achche tarike se karta hai. This guy is very intelligent, sharp and versatile. Har jagah ye tinka udta hua mil jayega. He is very good at acads and has maintained a good CGPA throughout his engg. Isne mujhe graphics padhaya tha and he was damn good at that. Thanks a lot for that buddy. He is a very good singer. Tinke bhai ke saath kai baar inter-house singing mein part liya hai and we have won points as well. This guy is very creative. Hamare batch ki design team ka bhi part hai. He is a good organizer as well. The way he worked for Felicity deserves accolades. Har jagah BC mein shaamil rehta hai fir chahe vo CS mein ho ya volleyball mein ho ya fir kahin par bhi. Acting bhi awesome karta hai. You should see him doing that Matrix one. He is a fun loving guy who always wanna enjoy every bit of his life and remains happy. Be the same as you are tinke. May God give you whatever you aspire for in your life. Cheers to our friendship. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhinav Parashar aka Paro aka Saruk<br><br>Isse interaction hua tha mera equitypulse aur SE ke time. Kitna bada frustoo hai saale tu. Equity ke time arbit colleges ki arbit bandiyon ko pakad pakad kar scrap kar raha tha ki hamara equity khelo. Haalanki equity to sirf bahana tha. Apna Saruk bahut hi hardworking banda hai when it comes to work as I have seen in equity and SE. Is bande ko alag alag poses mein photographs khichwane ka bahut shauk hai. Hamesha tuk mein baat karta hai. SE presentation ke time maine dekha ki ye achanak se kuch bhi gaana shuru kar deta tha like "Jungle jungle baat chali hai" .... aur aisi ultimate tune mein gaata tha ki mazaa aa jata tha. BC karne mein to maahir hai hi. UG4 mailing list par ye log jo bc karte hain ki kya hi batayein. Paro bhai, touch mein rehna. Hyd mein hi ho tum to. All the best for your future. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kapil Bajaj aka Bajju aka KBC<br><br>I regret having very less interaction with him in first three years of my college life. Now I know how good human being and an awesome friend he is ! This guy is very hard-working and intelligent. Placement time par do hi logon ki best preparation thi and those were PK and Bajju. Both got placed on the second day of placement session itself. His placement in Amazon is a tesimony to his intelligence. Maine kabhi socha bhi nahi tha ki bajju bhai hamare itne bade bcbaaz honge. Ye baat abhi pata chali. Volleyball mein Bajju, Bansi aur meri team ko koi nahi hara sakta. Class spiking karta hai. We have become quite good friends in the last semester. I hope this friendship grows stronger in the coming time. Oye, pehle hi bol raha hun, gayab mat ho jaiyo college ke baad. Contact mein rahiyo. Vaise bhi apan Hyd mein hi hain, saath milkar jam kar masti karenge. All the best for all your future endeavours. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish aka novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=khatri.html>Gaurank Khatri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Khatri aka "Khattu" aka "G for" aka "Sikandar" aka "Gladiator"<br><br>Kitna bada bcbaaz hai ye. Isse bada bcbaaz nahi dekha hoga. Jab logon ki maarne par aata hai to maarta jaata hai, chup hi nahi karta. But the good thing is, jab Khatri maarta hai to saamne vala bhi enjoy karta hai. Hamare resumes almost same hain. Dono ne hi second year mein Pramati mein intern ki thi. Dono ne hi third year mein MS mein intern ki thi. Before intern in Pramati, I never talked to him. Mujhe ye typical Delhite lagta tha. But intern ke time iske baare mein pata chala. This guy is amazing. Hum dono milkar Jitu ki khoob lete the us time. Uske baad fir humne saath gym jana shuru kiya 4-2 mein aur iski vajah se mere kuch aur achche friends ban gaye hain like Devi, Prabudh, Mohak and Poonia. Thanks for that buddy. Going to gym in 4-2 along with you guys will definitely remain in my cherishable memories of my college life. Volleyball ka naam yaad aate hi tera naam zaroor yaad aayega ki ek Khatri tha hamare batch mein jo kuch bhi kar le, kuch bhi strong se strong team lele, lekin uski team hamesha haarti thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. FIFA'07 ko bhi kabhi nahi bhoolunga, kitna pela hai tujhe usmein <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. aur badminton ka vo game, jismein apan dono ne first time singles' match khela tha aur tu haara tha. Us din Devi ne kuch jyada hi chadha diya tha tujhe <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bahut saari memories associate ho gayi hain yaar tere saath last semester mein. Keep rocking dude. Gurgaon jakar khoob bandiya ghumaiyo aur humein bhool mat jaiyo. Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All the best for all your future endeavours <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. CAT dekar fir se batchmates bante hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish aka novirus</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akshaysaad.html>Akshay Saad</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Akshay Saad aka jojo<br><br>Saad bhai apne ultimate cool bande hain. A bond when it comes to CS. CS khelne ke liye ye banda hamesha redy rehta hai. Jab chaho ise bula sakte ho. But jojo maarta bahut hai novirus ko CS mein. Isiliye iski team mein hona hi better rehta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But one must learn how to remain calm from this guy. The way he dealt with the placement pressure and the way he remained calm and patient during that time deserves accolades. BC bhi awesome karta hai. Ek baar main Maroo ke account se isse chat kar raha tha tab mujhe first time pata chala tha ki kitna bada bcbaaz hai ye <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Keep rocking buddy. All the best for your future. Keep in touch. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kiran Danduprolu aka Dandu aka Gargoyle aka Grolag<br><br>Apna dandu bhai ultimate cool banda hai. He is very sharp. I can say this thing for sure because his pc was not very far from mine in workspace. I have seen him doing C-programming. Is bande ka jo dimaag chalta hai, that is simply class. Then I never interacted with him much until now when we started playing CS together. Awesome CS khelta hai yaar ye banda. He is very passionate for CS. Agle din subah Dell ka interview tha aur mahashay raat mein baithe CS khel rahe the. Itna kaha ise par fir bhi nahi maana. Gamer to the core. Then we started playing volleyball as well and he is good at that as well. Mahaveer aur iska hamesha chhattees  ka aankda rehta hai volleyball mein. Thode din agar CS ya volleyball na khelo to banda pareshan ho jata hai. He is very clean at heart and a very well natured guy. Keep rocking dude. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitin.html>Nitin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nitin Bansal aka Bansi aka JAAT aka I_AM_HERE<br><br>Apna Haryanvi bhai hai ye to. The most witty person of UG2K5 I must say. Aise-aise comments maarta hai ki hasi control hi nahi hoti. Volleyball mein jis team mein main, bansi aur bajju hote hain, us team ko harana bahut tough kaam ho jata hai. ab to banda TT bhi khelne lag gaya hai. Bc jitni marzi karva lo isse. CS mein hum dono khoob maje aur bc karte hain. Dono hamesha ek hi team mein hoti hain aur nomercy(Sachin) doosri team mein hota hai. Fir iski help se main nomercy ko maarkar kuch bhi uski maarne vala message karta hun aur ye banda hamesha "lol" likh kar bhejta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Aajkal to volleyball mein bhi yahi karte rehte hain, hamesha opposite team vale ke liye lols par lols aate hain. Is bande ke saath bc karne ka alag hi maza hai. Keep rocking dude. Be the same as you are. Baki orkut par. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ojasvi aka Dark_knight<br><br>Apna hisari bhai hai ye to. I met this guy in my 12th class Physics batch when he was a dropper and freshers' and droppers' batches got merged. That time all of the freshers including me used to call him bhaiya "Ojasvi bhaiya" .... sounds a bit awkward now <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But I must tell you that this guy is a genuine bond in physics. Alag hi level par sochta hai banda. Har cheez mein physics lagane ki koshish karta hai. He is very intelligent and his MS intern and PPO are a testimony to this fact. Gamer to the core. Life ke fundo ke baare mein bahut sochta hai. Jeevan vidya achchi lagti hai bande ko. Chuttiyon mein isliye ghar nahi jata taki jeevan-vidya kar sake <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Keep rocking dude. All the best for all your future endeavours.<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>CS mein saala kuch bhi naam rakhta hai, padh kar hasi hi nahi rukti kafi der tak but ye kamina room se join karta hai ... saale lab aaya kar yaar ... ultimate bc hoti hai. He has opened a site as well related to MBA preparation which is doing really good and is quite a nice and intelligently made site. What I admire in this guy is his straightforwardness. I remember that in front of jury which sat to investigate the fighting between 2k5 and 2k6, when everyone was telling lies(I wasn't fighting, I wasn't involved etc), is bande ne seena thok kar bola tha ... "haan maine maara tha, maa ch***o ". bcbaaz to hai hi bahut bade vala. Aur pata nahi kitne logon ko peeta hai isne. 2nd years ka daddy hai but yaar, ab to thode hi din rah gaye hain, aajkal to time hum logon ke saath bita liya kar, un logon ke saath to agle poore saal bc kar sakta hai. I'll cherish our friendship and the memorable moments spent with u my whole life. Keep in touch for sure. Keep rocking. Aisa hi rahiyo, tu kabhi badaliyo mat yaar, u r simply awesome. Aur haan, MS ke baare mein bhi kuch soch le saale. May God give u success in your share market and whatever business or anything u do. Cheers to our friendship.

<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>Mahaveer<br><br>saale kutte haramkhor $##$%#$#  #$@#$#  $#$#$ @@#@$#$%$%<br><br>Iske testimonial ki shuruat to aise hi honi thi. Hum log jab bhi milte hain, hamari hi-hello gaaliyon se hi hoti hai. Hua aisa tha ki isne ek baar 2 din ka maunvrat kiya tha aur jab mujhe pata chala, to maine is bande ko itni jyada gaaliyan di thi ki bas, iske usse bahar aane par ye silsila chalu ho gaya aur abhi tak chalta aa raha hai aur aage bhi chalega <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We organized equity pulse together along with Paro, Banga, Ankush and Daddu. I must say that he is a good organizer as well as a good manager. Peeche pad jaata tha, chal-chal, aaj to ye kaam kar ke hi rahenge. I must say that his knowledge of share market is class. I got to learn a lot from him during that time. Then we took SE presentation together. It was hell lot of fun. Remember that Dr Verma thing and that Valentine day thing <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Banda awesome blogger hai. Ek hi article likha isne aur us time IIIT ka sabse popular blogger ban gaya <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Pyaar to bande ko har mod par ho jata hai. Saala dil-fenk aadmi hai. Ek baar canteen par baithe the aur kuch bandiyan jo gachibowli stadium mein aayi hui thi, they came. Bolta yaar mujhe is bandi se pyaar ho gaya hai. Fir thodi der baad ek aur bandi aayi, mr mahaveer "abe ye bhi mast hai yaar, mujhe isse bhi pyaar ho gaya hai" .... i was like wtf !! kuch bhi. This guy is damn witty and funny. Iske saath baith kar kabhi bore nahi ho sakte. Aur jab lene par aata hai to gandi maar leta hai. A damn good cricketer, very sharp sportsperson, bande ko samajh mein aa jata hai ki saamne vala banda kya karne vala hai ya saamne vali team ko kaise confuse kiya ja sakta hai and the clear example is volleyball. My FIFA guru. mujhe FIFA khelna isi ne sikhaya hai .... thanks a lot for that buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. But ab ye kameena ho gaya hai .... ab main jab bhi khelne ko bolta hun to mana kar deta hai, bolta hai ki ab main FIFA'09 khelta hun ... '07 purani cheez ho chuki hai .... haramkhor saala.<br>(Continued ..) </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Rishi aka Rissi aka cooldude<br><br>Let me start with the best memory with this guy: I was in train travelling from AP Express from Delhi to Hyderabad and I got a call from this guy .... "Manish bhai, mera placement ho gaya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .... kaha tha na sabse pehle tujhe call karunga, to sabse pehle tujhe hi bata raha hun" .... I was really happy for his placement and for me, that gesture of his' was really touching <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Thanks a lot for that mate. I can never forget that phone call in my whole life.<br><br>Initially is bande se kabhi kuch interaction nahi hua, but fourth year mein jaisi friendship hui hai, that has seriously given me a very good friend for my whole life. Start hua TT se jab Gupta, main aur ye ghanto TT khelte rehte the aur fir humne saath mein CS bhi khelna shuru kar diya aur ye kabhi kabhi volleyball mein bhi aa jaata tha. This guy, as his name(cooldude) is, extremely cool. Bahut hi pyaar se baat karta hai. A quick learner. That can clearly be seen from his TT skills. I have learnt patience from him. TT mein har baar return karta hai chahe vo point kitna hi lamba chale, aisa kabhi hote hue nahi dekha ki frustaa kar kuch galat shot khel le. Kameena hamesha mujhse singles mein jeet jata hai .... thode time ruk ja beta tu, tujhe main bataunga <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Felicity ki finance council mein bhi tha and he did an extremely good job. Keep rocking dude. Apan to hyd mein hi hain, to milte hi rahenge. All the best for all your future endeavours <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitingupta.html>Nitin Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nitin Gupta aka Gup"tha" aka Archangel<br><br>yaar tum logon ke CS vale naam main kabhi nahi bhool sakta. This has given me some of the best moments of my life. Anyway, lets start with the testimonial. Is bande se first 3 years kabhi jyada baat nahi hui. Till 3rd year, I used to know him as a guy who is a very good dancer and does Aari-2 on stage with Pappu and Chand. I interacted with him a bit when we danced together on stage for Aakash house, remember that Vassa Vassa, Pad ha roop karambu and all that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, what a time that was !! Then as our hostels got separated, so there was no chance of interaction. But I got to know this lean, thin and lambu guy in fourth year. It all started with TT where Rishi, him and me used to play TT together continuously for hours. Hum teeno ka aisa tha ki jab bhi bol do, teeno bande hamesha TT ke liye ready rehte the, fourth banda change hota rehta tha. Then we started playing volleyball together and he is quite good at that. Then we started playing CS together and I have spent some of the most memorable and cherishable moments of my life while playing that. Then we started gymming together as well aur ab bas basketball reh gaya hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. vo bhi khelenge. This guy is a jack of all trades. Har game khelta hai: cricket, volleyball, TT, cards, CS and what not. Padhai mein bhi sincere hai. A very good dancer as well but banda bahut hi seedha hai. iske saath bc karne mein bhi khoob maza aata hai. Iski udayi bhi bahut hai THA ke naam par. Fir is cultural night par to alag hi atmosphere tha. Guptha Uncle chhaaye hue the. Very down-to-earth guy who never gets rude. Apan to hyd mein hi hain, touch mein rahenge hi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Lets hope that our friendship grows stronger with time. All the best for all your future endeavours. Keep rocking. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Alok aka Ganja<br><br>Initially I knew this guy as Pankaj's roomie. Very decent guy I must say. Iski hum dono milkar khoob lete the but banda kabhi kuch nahi bolta tha. Hamesha ek pyari si smile deta rehta tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Kabhi bhi ise gussa hote hue nahi dekha. Kabhi ise rude hote hue bhi nahi dekha. A very mathured guy he is who knows how to behave in public. Aur masti ke time masti bnhi full karta hai. Bahut bada bcbaaz to hai hi. Ye, Atul aur Bajaj milkar jo banda down to earth hai, sincere hai, ye hai vo hai karke sabki udaate rehte hain but I'm telling you quite seriously dude that you definitely have all those qualities <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Yaad hai that Kabza song which we(Pankaj and me) used to listen a lot and you also liked that and you used to sing that in your typical Bihari tone aur fir hum jo teri maarte the, can't forget those memories in my whole life man <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. His sincerity towards studies is quite well known. He is also one of the THA contenders. This guy also tries to learn Haryanvi, Punjabi and Rajasthani tone and tries to speak to people of those states in their tones only which is a very nice and admiring gesture. Keep rocking dude. Don't change yourself. Achieve big in your life. May God bestow showers of success and happiness upon you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Banga<br><br>Amazing guy. Very dedicated towards whatever he does. Asks doubts in classes. Very intelligent. This guy has innumerable qualities. Whenever I feel the need for dedication in myself, I look upto 3 guys: Vibhav, Banga and Karan. I feel more attached with him and Ankush because I feel their duo to be very much similar as that of Adi's and mine. I have spent some quality time with him. BC sessions in cellar at his room with Pankaj, Ankush, Alok and him can never be forgotten. We took almost similar courses in our Btech. If we remove our names and personal details from our resumes, then those will look almost identical and it'll be really hard to correctly match those again with our names - same intern in second year (Pramati Middleware technologies), same intern in third year (Microsoft IDC), BTPs sponsored by Microsoft Open Source, job in same company as well (Microsoft), almost similar courses. Seriously, if I don't feel like making my resume, I could have his <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I find him very intelligent and very much serious towards his duties which I admire in him. When we used to sit with each other before MS Open Source presentations, I would find Ankush to be calm as always and this guy, very serious and continuously reading and thinking regarding what will he speak over there, a quality which I admire a lot in him. This guy is very religious as well, a quality worth admiring especially in a guy of his age. This guy is a genuine bond and there is a lot to be learnt from him. May God give you all the happiness and success in your life. Keep rocking <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ankush Kalkote aka Maratha Warrior (CS)<br><br>Kal Kal kote Kal Kal Kote .... ae o ae o ... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>If someone asks me to use just 2 words for this guy, then those would be intelligent and down-to-earth. Yes, this guy is very sharp, very intelligent and yet, down-to-earth. Bahut hi down-to-earth banda hai. Kabhi attitude nahi dikhayga. Ultimate cool bhi hai. Never seen him taking tension for anything at all: be it exam or interview or MS Open Source presentation <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> for that matter. I find a lot of similarities between me-Adi and Banga-Ankush groups. In both of the groups, dono hamesha saath saath rehte hain, saath-2 enjoy karte hain, saath-2 projects karte hain aur saath-2 hi courses lete hain. Dono ka hi BTP MS Open Source se funded hai. Talking about Ankush, his CGPA, placement, getting a call from IIM-B (without even preparing for CAT, maine tujhe dark-horse predict kiya tha, yaad hai na <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) are a testimony to his intelligence and sharpness. Aur is bande ne jo CO padhaya tha, vo main kabhi bhi nahi bhool sakta. Simply awesome. Thanks a lot for that buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And yeah, thanks for helping us out in Middleware project as well <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hamesha haste hue milta hai ye banda.  Google is lucky to have you. Keep rocking. Never change yourself. You are an amazing guy. I'll never forget all the bc we did especially before MS Open Source presentations and while working for trimaran in Compilers lab. All the best for all ur future endeavours. Bhai ko bhoolna nahi. Tu to hyd mein hi hai, to fir touch mein rahiyo pakke se. God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sachin aka Nomercy<br><br>Ise main hamesha nomercy naam se hi bulata hun. Nomercy ko CS mein hamesha novirus hi maarta hai I_AM_HERE ki help se aur I_AM_HERE hamesha "lol" likh kar bhejta hai. Jis din ye CS server join nahi karta, us din maza nahi aata <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> aur mera count bhi nahi badhta <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I first met this guy in cellar with Pankaj, Ojasvi, Kabeer etc. We gave ragging together (Remember that song sung by me and you were continuously saying "Wah Wah" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .... quite hilarious that was <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Initially, I got a wrong image of him and found him a bit arrogant jisko bas har ek ke maje lene mein hi maza aata hai. But how wrong I was ! This guy is very sharp and I came to know about it when I heard his result for mid-sem1 of C-programming. His placement is also a testimony to this fact. Movies ka to chalta-firta wikipedia hai. Ye aur Ranga jab ek team mein ho jayein to inhe koi hara nahi sakta. Abhi mahashay bcbaaz to hain hi. Is time antyakshari mein sirf isiliye part nahi liya taki sab doston ke saath baith kar bc kar sakein aur har participant ki jam kar uda sakein <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Ye, bajju, Paro, Atul vagarah kuch bhi bc karte hain mailing list par. Basketball bhi mast khelta hai. I didn't interact with him much in first 3 years and I'll definitely regret that. But fourth year has given me a lot of memories to cherish. Playing TT, volleyball and especially CS together and doing bc especially in all the events like Cult night, Felicity etc, doing acting of taking headshots of each other from time to time, his fun loving attitude, a lot of things are there. Now, we are really good friends. I'll just say that "This guy is awesome". Bangalore jakar bhool mat jaiyo aur touch mein rahiyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Keep rocking dude. May God give you all the happiness and success in your life. Hope our friendship grows stronger with time (as we have to make up for the first 3 years as well <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Movies ki date of release tak yaad rakhta hai. Hats off to him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . One two three ke dialogues awesome tarike se narrate karta hai. He is a good singer and a good dancer as well who has sung and danced many times on stage. He made a fool of me on April 1 and Paro got fooled by himself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . You are a bindas guy with ultimate cool and fun wala attitude. Be the same as you are <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.

Ye bhi Sambhav aur Mathur ki tarah har jagah udta rehta hai. I have never seen this guy without a smile on his face. Ultimate cool attitude towards life. Life should be full of fun and masti for him. Whenevr he comes in our wing, he leaves a smile on our faces. sab yahi bol rahe hote hain ki "mast banda hai". Bahut bada bcbaaz to hai hi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . My first memory of him goes back to first year when all of the novices were preparing to dance on stage. This guy is quite sharp as he learnt many dance steps quite easily and quickly. Chota sa banda hamesha hasta muskurata rehta tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Us time iske saath bc karne mein khoob maza aaya. But then most of our interaction happened in third and fourth year when I moved to OBH. One of the most memorable events with him is taking his special photograph with pk in his wing <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Us din iski khoob maari thi. But somehow, that photograph got lost. Then one is antyakshari conducted by him in Pagare's wing. It was fun. Then doing bc with him in mota's room where we all were reading fattas on discussion forum and trying to create some new ones. That Ringa thing also came out there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , remember? Then the most memorable one is booze party given by juniors to our batch. He was out in that and then because of some reason, I said "tu awesome banda hai yaar" and then he reverted back with the reply "jo khud awesome hota hai, use sab awesome lagte hain" and made some law regarding that. Then he told me that he drank only because he wanted to cry. Almost 150 people are going to separate their ways after some days and he is getting a bit senti and hence, he drank so that he could cry and I saw that tears were coming out of  his eyes.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mahesh - a very cool guy who used to sit beside me in classes. We used to have chats on various topics. This guy is very intelligent. We had to share the systems in workspace but he always gave me the system whenever I was in need. Thanks for that buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All the best for all your future endeavours.

Ise agar koi Sunil bulaye to ise pata nahi chalta ki kise bulaya ja raha hai. Everyone calls him Soni. He used to be my floormate in NBH. tab iski side se meri sirf isi se baat hoti thi. A very confident guy, got an intern in Amazon <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I have seen him playing volleyball sometimes and he is quite good at that.

<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I first met this guy in workspace sharing a same interest with me i.e. stickcricket as he has already mentioned in my testimonial. Then I used to meet him in gym doing exercise regularly. That time, me and Vibhav used to talk to him a bit. His dedication over there was worth admiring. That time, I left the gym after nearly 20-30 days but this guy continued and when I again joined the gym in fourth year, I found him still there doing exercise regularly and he has definitely improved a lot. This guy wants to take the leadership role in whatever he does and that's quite a good attitude if you can do justice to it. He is a singer and a poet as well. All the best for your MS and all your future endeavours <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Prashasti - Whenever this name comes to my mind, the words which come along with it are very intelligent, very sharp and extremely good natured. I have a lot of respect for her and for her sheer brilliance. Never interacted with her that much until fourth year came. Initially Chand used to tell me how much sharp she is. He told me when she hadn't prepared for OS till late night when we had that exam next day and then, got the highest marks in that exam. She is a good sportsperson as well as many other people must have mentioned in her testimonials. I have heard from Chand and Vipul that even if she wouldn't study a subject at all, she'll manage an A or A- in that. Then in fourth year when she asked me to teach OS, I was like "main ise kya hi padhaunga yaar, ise to sab aata hi hoga". In a matter of nearly 2 hours, she understood all of the chapters. I didn't need to explain any concept twice. But this time, it was like she might knew most of the things before, that's why. But when I taught her economics when she didn't have any background at all in that subject, she grasped it in a matter of few minutes. I was full of praise for her deep inside. By now, I completely agree with Chand that she is extremely sharp, brainy and intelligent and definitely, has the potential of achieving big in life. All the best for all your future endeavours. God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sanket aka daddu<br><br>This guy is our CR. When it comes to management, he is amongst the best. He is also a part of our placement committee and did an awesome job in that. This guy is damn good at pranks as well. Just look at the interviews which he took from various people in a train on some of his trip (probably Sikkim). It was hilarious man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I can never forget that. I saw it in TV room in NBH. No one in our batch can forget that how often and badly you used to get bashes especially in workspace. The way he narrates stories or incidents is class. He is best at that. Diplomatic at times, but good at heart and very helping I must say. It was he who used to get all the deadlines extended for us. Thanks a lot man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Workspace ka time extend karvana ho, daddu hai na. Though I got a wrong image of him in first sem where we got caught in scp case (because it was a very big deal for me that time) but I got to know actual daddu a bit later who is really helping. And yeah regarding that Jawahar sir's impression of you because of me, I'm extremely sorry for that but I think I must tell you that it wasn't my intention at all and I didn't say things like those to him, I still don't know how he got that impression. I think I explained that to you when you told me the same in second year in lab but still if you don't believe that, then we can definitely talk. I consider you a good friend by now. Your impression has changed a lot for me from first year to now and there is NO grudge at all regarding that scp case. I think I must thank you for what you have done for our whole batch and I definitely consider you a good friend now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Keep in touch.

<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 3<br><br>My first movie in theatre("No Entry") at hyd was also with him and one or two more guys of his group. Those Punjabi Rasoi outings can not be forgotten as well. That new year party when we both had long hair and were head banging like anything on rock, Felicity '07 rock show where you were wearing white t-shirt and I was wearing a red one <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and standing together in front row, we were head banging like anything (looks a bit idiotic now especially with those colour tshirts in rock show <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). I owe my globala grade completely to him. I felt really-2 bad when he got an A- (There was not a single person who deserved A more than him in that class). When it comes to HSSM, isse bada bond hamare poore batch mein koi nahi hoga. I have seen that he does a thing perfectly, madly, passionately and with full enthusiasm if he is interested in that thing but if he is not, then he won't give a damn. He won't do it. So, this is a minor suggestion from my side that even if you don't like something, do it as if it's your duty and don't screw that completely. His dedication for CAT was worth admiring. Though he couldn't make it this time but I'm sure that he'll definitely make it the next time. Tension mat le, MBA ke time apan dono fir se batchmates banenege <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Iska naam God ka bachcha kyun hai vo to har kisi ne bata hi diya hai. So, I won't go in that. A lot is there to be said. Probably some other time.<br><br>In the end:<br>You are a great friend dude. I'm luck to have a friend like you in IIIT. Thanks a lot for introducing me to the world of English movies and novels. Thanks for all the bc we have done, all the philosophical discussions we have done and everything for that matter. Find your passion in certain thing because I know that when you become passionate for a certain thing, you do it by becoming best in that. May God give you all the success and happiness in your life. Cheers to our friendship. Bangalore jakar bhool mat jaiyo aur contact mein rahiyo. Keep calling from time to time. God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br>Then memorable moments also include bc sessions between Chand, him and me in NBH-146, Alok ki khoob lena, Alok ka Kabza gaane ke style par mazaak udana (Punjabi gaane ko bihari tone mein gaata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), then taking part in group singing competitions together for our house, practising for the songs, trying to reach the pitch of original Chaiyya Chaiyya <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, joy at winning in group singing, whole of our group going to collect certificate while from other groups, just 1 or 2 people were collecting the certificates, railway journeys with him where he used to tell us a lot of stories, sitting at the door of the railway compartment with legs hanging outside and doing bc there, guessing the speed of the train, doing bc whole night, getting a bit philosophical and then next day, writing "Sorry" on a chit and giving that to an uncle who got disturbed a lot that night <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and above all, a railway journey where we initially boarded a wrong train and then jumped from the running train with all our luggage and then going in waiting (what an experience that was man !! I can never forget that and I'm sure that even you can't), going to gym together, that special dance step of yours, reading Harry Potter series together and discussing it and many more. I started reading novels because of him. I found him really passionate for reading. Class mein bhi har time iske haath mein koi na koi novel dikh jata hai. It's just because of him that I read Fountainhead and it's the best novel I have read till date. Thanks for suggesting that buddy. The way he narrates the incidents is awesome. He is a good blogger as well. I don't know why he has stopped blogging now. I think it's time for you to revive your blogging <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . You can start with UG2k5 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>Pankaj aka GKB<br><br>I first met this guy at the time of AIEEE counselling in Kurukshetra. That time he had beard and moustache and knowing his AIEEE rank, his first impression to me was - damn studious whose only aim in life is to study. Maine to Ojasvi ke saath milkar majak-2 mein ise peetne ka bhi plan bana liya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But I interacted with him in college and found out What an amazing guy he is ! I have interacted a lot with him in first 2 years and 4th year. But one year of my interaction with him in college is almost completely missing as in third year, we were staying in different hostels and couldn't get in touch. I'll definitely regret losing that 1 year but will cherish all the amazing time I spent in his company in the other 3 years. Going back to the first year, we have spent some quality time together. Getting ragged together, watching movies together, studying together .... being in different groups of friends didn't matter at all. I can definitely say that this guy is amongst my best buddies. I have learnt many things from this guy. I didn't use to see English movies back then. Aur is bande ne mujhe angrezi movies dikhane ke liye vo sab movies khud bhi mere saath baith kar dekhi. Iske saath movie dekhne mein maza bahut aata hai .... vo enthusiasm, vo har cheez movie rok kar explain karna especially in LOTR and Matrix, vo Godfather beech mein chodna because of me and Kabeer, Troy and our passion for Diane Kruger that time .... everything is so much memorable. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>Is bande ko bilkul last time par doosron se padhna achcha lagta hai aur fir ise us time mein us topic par research bhi karni hoti hai. But, one thing is for sure that he is very intelligent. Puzzles solve karta tha placements ke time bahut saari. Humse agar koi puzzle solve nahi hoti thi to hum 10-15 mins mein ya max 20-25 mins mein bol dete the ki ab solution batao, but ye to kai baar do-do din tak ek puzzle par laga rehta tha. The way he studied for placements definitely deserves an accolade. He and Bajju are the two guys who were most prepared for the placements and both got placed on 2nd day of placement session <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . This guy thinks a lot about things. Koi bhi kaam karne se pehle uske negative points ke baare mein sochta hai. Iske saath kai baar kuch discussions hui hain and I liked his views. Remeber that discussion on compulsory attendance. Abhi ke liye itna hi. Bhool mat jaiyo Bangalore jakar. Contact mein rahiyo aur call karta rahiyo. All the best for ur future. God bless <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br><br>Pk<br><br>Bhangi saala. Kitna kam nahata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Kitna jyada khata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Yes, a testimonial for PK must start with his eating and bathing habits. But if I'm writing a testimonial for him, then "Teen (3) " must be mentioned before other things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I hit him 3 punches on Chand's birthday when I got angry aur tab se ye hamesha mujhe yaad dilata rehta hai. Sorry for that buddy. But that added to one of my memorable incidents here <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Hamesha room mein baitha chips khata rahega aur koi na koi TV series dekhta rahega. We both like FRIENDS a lot and there is a division in group over that 70s and FRIENDS. Some memories include that 3 incident of course, breakfast in OBH mess where I, he and Bhalu were discussing "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and were laughing like anything. All of those who were in mess that time were looking at us in amazement that what has happened to these 3 guys, and one more would be when Maroo, Vipul and me made him to do 10 sit-ups. We told him that there is some big news which we will tell him only when he'll do 10 sit-ups and he did those only to find out that there was no such news <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Again, sorry for that if you felt bad but that was just for fun and nothing else dude.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>Then we moved to OBH after 2nd year and he chose CVIT for doing his MS. Kya dedication se kaam kiya hai bande ne vahan par. I don't know if many people in our batch know this or not but he is a well known researcher in that field. Wherever Dr PJN goes, he talks about him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . His paper(which is quite popular by itself) has also been used as a reference by a popular paper of that field. He has got fellowship as well and in future, his expenditure on studies (including PhD) will be incurred by that company. I hope that he get an internship in MSR - Redmond. And I pray to God that he get admission for PhD in whatever university he wants <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Jab enjoy karne par aata hai to enjoy bhi full karta hai. Peekar jo isne kaand kiye hain vo to ab har kisi ko pata hi hain. You are a very good friend for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I hope our friendship grows more and more stronger with time. This is my confidence that you will definitely achieve whatever you want in life. All the best for your start-up. Hope you start it soon and it becomes a big-big success <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Keep in touch. Bahar jakar humein bhool mat jaiyo. Phone karta rahiyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Aur tu kitna hi bada ban jaye, mere liye chotu hi rahega <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br><br>Vibhav aka Bachcha<br><br>I like to call him Chotu. Maine apni life mein isse jyada dedicated banda nahi dekha hoga. Kai baar to ise ye bhi nahi pata hota ki last time ye soya kab tha. 3-4 din lagatar bina soye agar koi banda kaam kar sakta hai poore IIIT mein, to vo sirf Vibhav hoga. A genuine bond. Graphs mein to kabhi bhi isse baat karo, kuch alag hi level par bc karta hai. I have immense respect for him and for his dedication. Adi ka roomy tha. Jab isse baat nahi hoti thi to bahut hi strange sa character lagta tha. Main Adi ke room par jata aur knock karta. Ye thoda sa door open karke usse apna sir bahar nikalta, main poochta "Hi, Adi hai kya?" .... "Nahi hai" .... aur fir door band. Jab isse baat honi shuru hui, tab iske baare mein pata chala. I have learnt a lot from him when it comes to dedication. Adi, him and me, we used to study together during exams. sabse pehle Adi sota tha, fir main but ye fir bhi laga rehta tha. Then came the second year and we became very good friends till then. OS ke assignments batch mein bahut kam log karte the aur hum dono saath baith kar kiya karte the. I really enjoyed solving assignments with him. Then in ITWS-3, we (Adi, Chand, him and me) made a group and took a project (Beeja di Sakti <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) under Dr Sangal. That time was class. Many memories are related to that time like a nightout for just drawing a line and running to seniors for that, a night out for finding a very small bug in the project, a night-out just 1 or 2 days before the exam to integrate our project with Siva Reddy's project.<br>(Continued...)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Motu<br><br>Sabse pehli baat, iska chaar naam maine hi rakha tha. Aur fir use chaar se paanch bhi maine hi kiya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Padhai achchi lagti hai to lagti hai, chalo thik hai. But kisi course mein itna kya interest aa gaya ki use 2 baar karne ki hi thani <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Vaise, he got a placement in a company which mostly deals with the contents of that same course. Then, he taught that course to the whole batch for placements and to some juniors as well for their intern. Kafi yaadein judi hain is bande ki DBMS ke saath <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But, all is well that ends well <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Iske room par jab bhi jao, koi 90s ka gaana like nazar ke saamne jigar ke paas, main shayar to nahi etc chalta mil jayega. I can't imagine that some guy could be this much senti. Bilkul bandiyon ki tarah senti hota hai. Senti movies dekhta hai aur vo movies dekh kar rota bhi hai .... wtf !! First date par apni gf ko mandir le jata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I think bandiyon ko aise hi bande pasand aate hain, fir to main bhi aage se mandir jaya karunga <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Bahut hi jyada brainy banda hai. This guy got an admission in ISI as well. Creative banda hai. His designing skills are class. Poster ho ya batch t-shirt, har cheez ke design mein important role play karta hai. Sketching to awesome hai hi iski. Ek maa ki tarah sabko pyaar karta hai aur sabka dhyan rakhta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Iske room par jakar khoob BC hoti hai. Fatte par fatte chalte hain. Alag hi level ki BC hoti hai jo max janta ko shayad samajh hi na aaye. Logon ko kya peet ta hai unke b'day par, kamina. Makkhiyan udata rehta hai jab bhi koi iske aas paas mandrane lagta hai. Coming to more serious terms, this guy is damn sharp, intelligent, very emotional and a bada bcbaaz. You are a very good friend. I enjoyed the Bc sessions with you and especially that one which we did while watching Veer Zara <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Itna jyada senti mat hua kar.

<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>He used to play guitar as well but he has stopped it now. I don't know why. I think you should continue with that if you still like doing that. It's not always difficult to find some time for some hobby. Vaise, main jab bhi iske room par jata hun, to guitar uthakar baith jata hun. This guy is a very good basketball player as well. Iske saath TT khelne mein bhi khoob maza aata hai. I think when he is high on his confidence, he plays really awesome but sometimes, I don't know why, he looses confidence aur us time, isse bura bhi koi nahi khel sakta. Dude, I think you should remain confident about whatever you do. I know that you have the potential to do anything perfectly but I think you don't know that and I'm giving it a try through this testimonial to make you realize that. Remain confident always and the success will be yours. This guy shows a lot of patience during placements and got a good result. I think I need to learn that from him coz when it comes to such things, I'm very-2 less patient. He is a good organizer as well. I think a very few clubs are functioning properly here and photography club is one of those whose coordinator is this guy. He also organized Kalakshetra in last Felicity and it was a big success. I wish you luck for your future buddy. May God bestow His showers of blessings upon you. We'll remain in touch of course. Dono hi Hyd mein hain and we are definetly going to enjoy a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br><br>Shrikant aka Ganja aka Aksay (not Akshay) aka ..... a long list it is (just like mine <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> )<br><br>This guy is the photographer of our work. He has immense passion for photography and clicks some real good pics. But main iski khoob leta hun, kahin bhi kisi bhi choti choti ya ajeeb ajeeb cheezon ki ajeeb ajeeb angles se photo leta hua dikh jata hai and I don't understand even a bit in that. But when outcome comes, I must say that I have to appreciate that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Cool banda hai, kabhi ise jyada tension lete hue nahi dekha padhai vagarah ki. Meri tarah fatte maarte hai, isiliye hamari company mein kai baar doosre logon ko kafi baatein samajh mein nahi aati jo sirf hamein hi aati hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I like doing BC with him. Then, we both like FRIENDS a lot. Jab bhi bore ho rahe hote hain, aur ye mere room par aata hai to hum koi na koi FRIENDS ka episode laga kar baith jaate hain aur fir baithe rehte hain kafi-2 der tak. He is famous for shouting as well. Actually, his voice is a bit loud, to hum iski is baat par khoob maarte hain. Aur ye bhi chillane ke liye koi na koi bahana dhoondta hi rehta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Most of the times, we do BC in Adi's room. He has a passion for cars as well. Banda apna Casanova hai. Blog par likhta hai, "I think girls like me" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Ye to mazak ki baat hui, but I think that this should be true as well <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( haan-haan, khush ho ja <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). <br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br><br>Koi bhi kaam karne ke liye kafi passionate rehta hai aur bahut sochta bhi hai uske baare mein, whether it's his work in CVIT or working out in gym or dancing, anything. This guy goes blank as well many times. Mote ki bahut mast leta hai ye banda. Kabhi-2 isse agar kuch baat ya nonk-jhonk ho jaye, to ye yaad nahi rakhta use, bahut hi jaldi bhool jata hai. A lot of memories are there but no time for those now. You are a very good pal for me dude. And yeah, a serious thanks for paying the frequent visits to my room. I can never ever forget those. All the best for your MS and your future. May God give you whatever you aspire for in your life. Never forget me and keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . The only suggestion I would like to give you is increase your confidence level a bit at whatever you do. Whenever you start something, just think that you can easily do that and then I'm telling you, you'll see wonders. Don't worry about all these 2020 jokes. I'm confident that you'll be able to complete your MS in 1 more year. Bhai ko mat bhooliyo aur hamesha touch mein rahiyo yaar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I'll really miss you and our awesome bc sessions. God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br><br>Mr neat and clean room. Iske room par jab bhi jata hun, mujhe neend aa jati hai. Kya karein, inductive effect bhi kaha ja sakta hai use <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Raman ke sone ke kisse to bahut popular hain hi. Sapne mein recursion mein kaun sota hai? But coming to more serious terms, bahut hi shareef aur bhola banda hai. Iske saath bc karne mein khoob maza aata hai. Gopiyon mein kanhaiya vale kafi kisse sune hain iske <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and I like the way he narrates those. He and Adi are the only guys who used to visit my room frequently. Thanks a lot for that buddy. That really meant a lot to me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Main pen drive lekar maximum times iske ya Mathur ke room par chala jata hun instead of downloading the things myself as I'm very lazy at that. Iska "oye Pagare" vala incident to bhoola hi nahi ja sakta <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Iski kaafi lene par bhi ye banda bilkul bura nahi maanta aur agar maanta bhi hai to thodi hi der mein thik ho jata hai and I really admire that a lot as that behaviour is exactly opposite to mine. This guy is very good at maths. He and Pagare are really good mathematicians. That's why I have a special respect for him. Gym jane ka sochta hai lekin thode hi dino mein josh thanda ho jata hai. NIFT, poty on the road and cock vale kisse bhi nahi bhulaye ja sakte <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Har time bechara  kisi na kisi controversy mein fasa rehta hai jinmein se kafi time to isne kuch kiya bhi nahi hota. A very good TT player he is and I have definitely learnt a lot in that game from him. Kafi mehnati banda hai. Aajkal kafi time lab mein spend karta hai. Let's hope ki ise MS jaldi hi mil jaye. We have taken part together in group singing a few times and we have won some points for our house as well. A good singer I must say.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br>Then we really enjoyed when we were preparing for the inter-house dance event with Tava in lead. We danced on Vassa, padha roop karambu etc songs and we did enjoy that. I can never forget that time and the way we used to prepare. In a class room, by removing all the desks and then rearranging those at the end. I also remember a very funnny incident where Maroo was leofying Chand and he was trying to hit us. Chand was outside. Suddenly this guy went into the room, wore a helmet and came out like a fighter or knight or something. He gave damn good expressions and that was probably the funniest moment of IIIT for atleast me, Chand and him. Daaroo peekar to paagal ho jata hai. RDB style koodna chahta hai. Apni body par kaanch fodna chahta hai aur pata nahi kya kya. Holi par to kaand hi kar diya tha mahashay ne. We all got really worried. Is time jab club 8 gaya tha to aakar logon ki jam kar maari thi (Ankiet ki, Raman ki, Kshitiz ki aur bhi bohoton ki), maza aa gaya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.Abhi aage baad mein kabhi likhunga. Poona mein full aish kariyo. Mast-2 bandiya ghumana tu aur pappu, dono milkar. AUr hamein mat bhoolna. Call karte rehna time to time. Keep in touch buddy. I don't wanna loose contact with an awesome friend like you. May God give you all the success in your life. CAT ke liye saath prepare karenge aur hopefully fir se batchmates banenge <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>Chiku<br><br>Is bande ke saath kafi memories associated hain. But let me start with an intro kinda thing of this guy. The first thing I notice about him is sincerity in whatever he does. This guy is good at studies. Kuch bhi kaam ho, hamesha exact time par poora mil jayega. The only guy in our group who still sticks to a timetable. Even Maroo has changed now. His sincerity could be seen while preparing for CAT as well. He is a very good basketball player. I find him a quick learner. Abhi-abhi volleyball khelna shuru hua and he became quite good at that. This guy knows what he has to do and when to do that and it's not that, he just knows, but he also does that. Bcbaaz to hai hi. Logon ki mast leta hai. This guy is damn witty. He is well known for his class one-liners. Seriously man, tera naam yaad aate hi sabse pehle yahi yaad aayega ki tu kya mast one-liner maarta tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I think you are like Chandler from FRIENDS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . But jab bhi iski lene ki koshish karo, to chidh jaata hai (meri tarah <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) . Sabse bade kamine ka competition bhi rehta hai iske aur mathure ke beech mein but jeet ta hamesha yahi hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . This guy is a very good dancer as well. Now why didn't I mention this quality above where I mentioned most of his qualities. This is so because some memories are associated with him when it comes to dance. I clearly remember the first time when we first-timers were preparing to dance on stage. At the last moment, we got to know that one of the guys won't be dancing. Then we requested chika to join us in place of that guy and after some requests, this guy agreed and I was shocked to see that he learnt all of the dance steps very soon and did a perfect dance with all of us on stage. That's when I got to know that he is not just a good dancer, but a very quick learner as well.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 3<br>A lot of memories are associated but as I have started writing testimonials quite late, so its difficult to compile everything now .... will definitely continue it on orkut. During placements, when I heard that you became very serious and even stopped talking to people, I got really worried and thankfully, I soon got the news of your placement and was extremely happy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Abhi iski baki qualities to har ek ne describe kar hi di hain. I think I'll stop as of now but will continue some other time for sure.<br><br><br>I think I should give my views on one more thing. You want to live a bindaas life full of friends and masti which is a very good attitude. But never think at some point in life, if I could have tried this I might have been able to do that. Because I know you definitely have the potential of achieveing big in your life. So, keep one goal in mind: either that first attitude with no worries or if you go for the second one, I'm telling you that no one in this world can stop you with such an awesome brain like yours which always tries to think logically(a clear example is Mathematics <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). <br><br>May God give you all the happiness in your life.<br>Don't forget me and remain in touch.<br>Pune jakar humse duur mat chala jaiyo. Jab tu Bangalore gaya tha, tab apni jyada baat nahi ho payi thi <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> but this time I'll try to make sure that this doesn't happen <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Khoob bandiyan pataiyo vahan jakar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but bhaiyon se milne hyd aata rahiyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br>Is kamine ne ek baar peekar mere khoob maje bhi liye the jab NBH-146 ke saamne vala room khali tha aur in logon ne vahan par pi thi. Bahar nikalkar bola, ki mujhe toilet karna hai to main ise bathroom tak le jane laga, but kamina shuru ho gaya mere maje lene - kood kood kar bolne laga "main to yahin mootunga" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We both are not really good at handling a computer. But ye banda to hadd hai, second year tak ise windows mein naya folder create karna nahi aata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Third ya fourth year mein bande ko laga ki 200 compiler par <br> khatam ho gaye hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .... wtf !! A very good dancer I must say. This guy is damn talented - good mathematician, good dancer, good leader (proof is Felicity'08), an extremely good cricketer (best bowler of IIIT) and very intelligent. He is good at algorithms as well. Jahan par bhi kuch buddhi lagane ki cheez aati hai to banda awesome perform karta hai. OS to fodu hai hi iska. Aise hi thodi na ye baba ban gaya tha jiski savari badi shaan ke saath nikali gayi thi. Jiske liye chop suey bhajan roz bajaya jata tha, jiske charno mein Banga jaisa vidvaan bhi pada rehta tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But the best memory would be taking part with him in  continuing a movie clip where we got a scene from Bruce Almighty. Ahh, what did Almighty do with us that time. Abhi tak yaad karke hasta hun. Savita and Dhi-chik Dhi-chik yaad hai na <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . One memory is that of a little fight we did (actually I did, extremely sorry for that buddy) in your room and one is of those mails for sure which we sent to each other. Also, saath saath gym jana aur body dikhane ke naye naye tarike ijaad karna <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, teri jalana when you couldn't do gymming coz of muscle catch (but I really felt bad that time), that Raman's "oye Pagare" incident outside NBH-146, your dance on stage when Shaan himself was singing there in MS party, your calling me by names Manishe, Sindhi and Goonjit (yes, I remember that as well), your habit of noticing small-2 things in people and making fun of those and volleyball of course .<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>Pappu<br><br>First time maine jab iska naam suna tha to ise khoob galiyan di thi. Kyun? Someone told me that there is a guy who is a good competitor for Chand in race of Mr Fresher. And I was like, kaun kamina *#$#$#$ hai saala jo mere roomie se compete karega. Then slowly I got to know him as he used to come to our room for doing BC with Chand or for some reason or the other. Chand is bechare ko sone nahi deta tha aur roz iske room par kafi der tak bc karta tha. Ek din banda frustaa gaya aur room par aakar baith gaya, subah tak jaane ka naam hi nahi liya taki Chand ko sabak sikha sake. That was probably my first night-out in IIIT (though it was till 4 or 5 AM only) . Slowly, I got to know him and found out that he is a genious in Mathematics. I think he is probably the best mathematician of all those i have ever seen and whenver I see that if someone's math is really good, I feel a special respect for that person and that is one of the reasons that I have a special respect for this guy and his abilities. First year mein mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai ki iski C ke assignments mein kitni lagi rehti thi. Vaise cool rehta tha but exams mein fat leti thi. Mere room par aakar kuch na kuch naye naye questions dhoond dhoond kar lata (his source used to be Abhilash for most of the times) aur kehta ki ye exam mein aane vala hai aur hum milkar unke solutions nikalne ki try karte. Maths ka mujhe koi bhi doubt aata to main isse ya Adi se hi poochta tha. Iska room NBH-47 to hamara BC hub tha. Har baar BC vahin par hoti thi. In the first year, Marathe mam asked us to write about characteristics of some person of the class so that she could recognize him. I chose the one who had the most peculiar characteristics as far as looks, walking style etc were concerned so that I could write easily but this guy chose me and I still remember a few lines from that. It was really touching <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Thanks for that buddy.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In the end:<br>My suggestion to you is: leave carelessness, you are actually very intelligent as I have realized and complete your research as soon as possible by doing hard work. Downloading mein hi mat rah jaiyo. Aur, bhai ko yaad rakhiyo aur contact mein rahiyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . God bless <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br>When we shifted to OBH, he got a room on 3rd floor and we got on 2nd floor. So, he became a pseudo-wingie as he used to remain in our wing for most of the time. Then in 4th year, he again became my wingie again and it was fun to be a wingie with him again. Hamara downloader yahi ban gaya. Main to bas pen drive le aata idhar udhar se aur har cheez isi se lekar jata. Khud kabhi download nahi karta. DC par aisa kuch nahi hota jo isne na dekha ho. Bande ki movies dekhne ki kya speed hai. 10 min mein poori movie khatam. Fir jab movie discuss karo to ise kuch pata nahi rehta usmein <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Iske room par har time koi na koi TV series ya video chalta hi rehta hai ya fir ye CS khel raha hota hai. We irritate him a lot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Main, Maroo, bhalu aur buddha milkar iski roz chop karte hain. Ek baar to ye Bangalore ya Chennai mein tha, tab humne iski chop karke ise message kiya ki teri chop ho gayi hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Ise utha kar paani bharne le jaate hain chahe iski bottle full hi kyun na ho <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Iske room ki light to jaati hi rehti hai (light gayi oye, light gayi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Once, me, Chand and Bhalu were at his room and he just started Bomarillu for time paas, but then we insisted on watching the whole movie and he had to bear a nightout when he didn't want to. Banda TT awesome khelta hai and I really like playing TT with him as I have learnt a lot in that game from him. Then this guy introduced me to the CS and the elite CS group ... thanks a lot for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hyper awesome CS khelta hai. But snow mein Hyper ko sabse jyada kaun maarta hai ?? - novirus, aur kaun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Iske laal hone ke to kisse kaafi popular hain hi. Koi kisi doosre par chillaye, tab bhi ye banda laal ho jata hai. Aur, bhalu ko to ise laal karne mein maza aata hi hai. At last, I would like to say that this guy is a very good friend of mine. Hope he completes his research as soon as possible. Best wishes for ur future pal. Keep in touch for sure. Weekends par to vaise bhi apan log saath mein honge hi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>Mathur aka fjords aka Hyper aka TK aka girgit aka tinka .......<br><br>Is tinke ki first year se hi har jagah udte rehne ki aadat hai .... har jagah, har kahin kisi bhi group ke saath kuch na kuch khelte ya bc karte dikh jata hai. A very active person I must say. Har jagah apna katvata rehta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I got to know him in second year when he shifted to NBH in my wing. Before he shifted to our wing, I used to know him as a guy jo har jagah har ek ke b'day par peet ta hua aur pit ta hua dikh jata tha. When he shifted to our wing, I started interacting with him. Equitypulse ke time humne khoob bc ki thi. Chand ke naam par kitne hi accounts banaye the (chand, chandc, chandch, chandchu etc <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) . At that time, I found this guy intelligent but careless. aur ye baat mujhe ITWS project ke time par pata chali jab isne project Sainani ke saath liya tha. He made that site quite beautiful and professional and I liked the kind of things he did in that site including search and highlighting searched things and many more. Us time par ye mujhe kamina lagta tha. But asli Mathur tab saamne aaya when he allowed naughty to become his roomie. Naughtie wanted to shift to NBH and Mathur had no roommate. Then I thought, agar koi banda single occupancy se double occupancy tak mein jane ko raazi ho jaye to vo kameena nahi ho sakta. But I don't know why he tries to portray himself as a kameena when he is not. He is actually a good guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 3<br>We have spent quality time while living in the same wing. Chand, him and me, we used to do BC whole night. Maroo bechara CAT ke dino mein bahut pareshan hua hai. Dumble vala incident to yaad hoga hi jab har bande ne humein next din jam kar gaaliyan di thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Mathur ki chop karna, saath-2 paani bharne jana. Seriously man, I can never forget the kind of things we have done while living in this wing. Awesome memories. I can never ever forget you guys. Bahut saari baatein rah gayi hain. But you know this fu**ing time limit and my laziness .... will continue more on orkut for sure. One suggestion( this is the first suggestion I'm giving in my testimonials but I think this is required): Realize your potential. You are very-very sharp but you have got a very careless and carefree attitude. I feel that you can achieve wonders in your life with your kind of brain but it needs to be concentrated at something. I won't say that may God give you whatever you aspire for in your life (because I know ki teri bandiyon ko chod kar life mein kuch aspirations nahi hongi.) but I'll definitely say that may God give you some aspirations and then you can achieve those yourself I'm confident about that. Ab toh mujhe irritate karna thoda kam kar de. Pata nahi aur kitne time jhelna padega tujhe <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But actually speaking, if you won't irritate me, then I'll miss something for sure <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Remain in touch even if one of us moves out of Hyderabad. Bhai ko bhoolna nahi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . God bless. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br>This guy is famous for his multiprocessing as well. Ek saath banda movie dekh raha hota hai, chat kar raha hota hai, game khel raha hota hai, koi blog padh raha hota hai, orkuting kar raha hota hai aur twitter par bhi hota hai. God knows how does he manage all that. Iska phone par hello bolne ka dhang bhi awesome hai .... Aello .... nail biting is also one of his habits. Duniya ki har weird cheez agar ek insaan mein dhoondni ho to Bhalu definitely jeetega usmein. This guy loves blogging and one of the most successful bloggers of IIIT. But, jab Chand iski maarne par aata hai, chahe vo blogging ho ya belly ho ya bandiyan, gandi maarta hai. Mazaa aa jata hai. He loves Sachin Tendulkar. Agar Sachin ise kuch bhi karne ko kahe, kuch bhi (you know what I mean <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), to ye uski har baat bina soche samjhe maan lega. <br><br>We did internship in MS together. Us time iska target thankfully Adi tha. Hum dono milkar bechare ko khoob irritate karte the. Hum teeno ne apni foosball team bhi bana li thi. Teri kami mahsoos hogi yaar MS mein <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> (thik hai, mujhe pata hai tu kya bolne vala hai .... jab bhi hum join karenge <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... ab thik hai?) .

<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>The Most Irritating Guy<br>Bhalu aka bhalukiran<br><br>Yes, the first line of his testi had to be this. I have never seen a guy who could irritate more than him. Isko kabhi bhi kisi ko bhi irritate karne ko bol do, ye kar sakta hai and he feels proud at this achievement.<br><br>Interaction with him began in the first year when we all went for Dussehra outing. Ultimate cool banda hai. Kabhi bhi ise exam ki ya CAT ki (<img src=Smileys/4.gif />) tension lete hue nahi dekha. BC kabhi bhi karva lo, hamesha ready rahega. An extremely intelligent, talented and gifted guy who doesn't need much preparation for anything and if he does, then he screws that up. This guy got a 99+ percentile in CAT and an internship in Microsoft without preparing much for those. He has a passion for numbers and calculation. Har time baithe baithe kuch na kuch calculate karta rehta hai ya numbers ke saath khelta rehta hai. Class mein baithkar mahashay ko 2^100 calculate karne mein khoob maza aata hai. I think he should have born nearly 50-60 years ago. Isko har cheez purani hi pasand aati hai. 70s ka music sunta hai, 30s - 40s ki movies dekhta hai. Ajeeb hi interests hain is bande ke. Hitler se pyaar hai inhe (saale tu bhi Hitler se kam nahi hota jab tu irritate karne par aata hai) . Iske room par jao to jab bilkul shanti hogi, tab 5-10 min baad SHAYAD tumhe aisa lage ki kuch music chal raha hai. Bahut hi low volume par music sunta hai aur jab tumhe pata chalta hai ki music chal raha, then you'll also notice that he is enjoying the music as well. pata nahi ise sun kaise jata hai. Jab bhi bahar nikalte hain, tab stars mein pata nahi kya kuch dhoondta rehta hai. Sahi mein ajeeb hi banda hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I think he is the biggest boozer of our batch. MS party kabhi nahi bhoolunga main haramkhor <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Iske jaise kamine suttebaazon ki vajah se main bhi passive smoker ban gaya hun <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . Banda Casanova to hai hi.

<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>This testi is going to be about an emotional, senti, friendly, caring guy who goes into SILENT mode whenever he gets leofied.<br><br>Never interacted with apne Vipul bhai in first 2 years although I used to go to his room a few times to meet Raman. This guy was shy and hence, I couldn't get to know him until the third year when he became my wingmate, thanks to Chand for that. Vipul bhai apne "The Most Sophisticated" person in UG2K5 as he claims, but he actually is quite sophisticated. Keeps his room neat and clean. When my parents came, my room was at its best as far as cleanliness is concerned, but when they saw Vipul bhai's room, their first comment after that was "Tu apna room saaf kyun nahi rakhta" .... mujhe pata nahi tha that they have seen Vipul's room, maine immediately poocha ki aapne buddhe ka room dekha kya? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> banda bahut hi emotional hai .... pehle to kuch bhi movie dekh kar ro deta tha, ab to fir bhi isne rona kam kar diya hai. Bahu is one of his nicknames. According to Chand, his character resembles Komolika <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He also loves to bitch about others ... aur Maroo ke roop mein ise ek aisa jodidaar bhi mil gaya hai who also likes the same thing. This guy gets irritated very easily. Iske room par kuch bhi aisa kar do jisse room thoda sa ganda hone ki just possibility ho aur room actual mein ganda bhi na hua ho, tab bhi irritate ho jata hai and then he goes into his famous silent mode. Ye akela aisa banda hai jisne 4 saalon mein Chand ki mujhse jyada li ho. Zaroorat ka kuch bhi saaman chahiye ho, Vipul bhai hain na. Choti se choti aur badi se badi zaroorat ki cheez inke room par mil jayegi. His room is the BC place of our wing kyunki akela aisa room hai is wing mein, jo saaf rehta ho. Ye bahu kammeni, kulta, kulachchini bhi hai. Jab doosron ki lene par aati hai to leti hi rehti hai, chodti nahi. He and Maroo irritates me a lot sometimes, kamine saale. But really, its fun to be around him. Choti Choti baaton ke baare mein bhi bahut sochta hai.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br>A very good friend I must say who will always be there whenever his friends are in need. Roz bolta hai ki haan be, aaj bhaagne jaunga, aaj gym chalunga, aur jab iske room par jao, "abe aaj nahi be" and the same thing repeats everyday <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Isko humne bhi kafi irritate kiya hai. Ye incident maine apne sab wingies ki testi mein likha hai probably jab Vipul aur Maroo wing tak chodne par aa gaye the. Bechara Kshitij bhi bahut pareshan hua tha. Chacha ka bhi buzz aaya tha. Actually we were trying to wake Sambhav up from Chand's room (Sambhav's room is exactly below Chand's) at nearly 4:30 AM by continuously hitting a dumble on the floor aur agle din jo galiyan padi thi logon se <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He is a very good dancer as well. "Nain Lad jai ve" par banda kya naachta hai. How can we forget those dance practice sessions with Tava ... vassa re vassa vassa re, pad haa roop kaarambu sth <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Doosron ko padhata hai, par jab main kuch padhane ko bolun, to bolta hai "abe tujhe nahi padhaunga" .... hadd kamina hai. He and Maroo are the two guys coz of whom I'm able to do breakfast <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Time par jaagne, sone vala banda hai jo ki hamari vajah se bahut tang hota hai. Main, ye aur Maroo milkar Mathur ki chop karte rehte hain. All in all, I find this emotional guy a real good friend who cares a lot for his friends. The time I have spent with him in this wing in these 2 years has been amazing and I'm happy that I got a wingie like him. A lot is there to be said but yearbook ki deadline khatam ho rahi hai .... probably some other time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Bhai hai yaar tu. College ke baad room ke paas mein tum logon ki presence ko main bahut bahut miss karne vala hun <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . 5 saal mein MS khatam kar liyo. aur hum log milte to rahenge hi, hyd mein jo hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Thanks for being a part of the 2 wonderful years of my college life and making it more fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . You are a very good friend of mine and we'll definitely remain in touch. God bless !!<br><br>Saale sirf tera hi testimonial aisa hai jo main seedha post kar raha hun <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In the end:<br>I admire you a lot buddy and your dedication. I have learnt a lot from you especially while living in the same wing. You are a gem which our whole batch is proud to have. I'm lucky to be bestowed with a friend like you. I don't know whether you'll remain here or go to Indore. But I'm telling you, if you remain here we'll have loads of fun for sure. But take the right decision after considering all of the things. Don't make a haste in this decision. I know you will definitely make a big entrepreneur some day. Hope you reach the heights of success. I know I can contact you whenever in some need or trouble. I assure you that you can always count on me. Be the same as you are because you are one of the best leaders and organizers of all those I have ever seen. Bas gussa thoda sa kam kar liyo <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . And yeah, keep in touch. Call karte rehna. Last time, you went to Bangalore, we couldn't remain in contact much but this time, I'll try to make sure that this thing doesn't happen. You are an amazing friend. God bless <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 4<br>Mujhe roz subah breakfast ke liye uthane ki zimmadari ab buddhe par aur ispar aa gayi. So, these guys used to wake me up for the breakfast and we used to go together. This responsibility is still with buddha and him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I go late for lunch and dinner, so I don't find anyone to go to mess with me. But here also, Maaddoo hai na. He also goes late for his meals. But he has to wait a lot in mess coz of me as I take a lot of time to eat but he never says anything. But haan, kabhi-2 jab bhalu bhi saath hota hai, tab ye bhi shuru ho jata hai uske saath dukhi karne. Yahan aakar ye kamina Bhalu ka shishya ban gaya. Ab ye dono milkar mujhe khoob irritate karte hain. Pehle har ek se marvane vale bande ne ab maarni shuru kar di. I was amazed to see his dedication for CAT. But we(Chand, Bhalu and me) disturbed him a lot (Sorry for that buddy). We daily used to have our BC sessions from midnight 12 to morning 4. And when we would wake up, we could very easily see frustration on Vipul's and his face. Once they got so much irritated (remember that dumble incident when we were trying to wake Sambhav up from Chand's room) that they decided to leave the wing. Badi mushkil se bhailog ko manaya humne. Some of the memories include "Mathur ki chop karna (even if he is not around.... ek baar to bechara Bangalore ya Chennai mein tha, tab bhi uski chop karke use SMS kiya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), light gayi - light gayi thing, going together to fill water bottles (aur jo bhi na aaye, use jam kar irritate karna), Manis-Janice(u have already mentioned in my testi but it needs to be there in yours too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), going together for our meals - be it breakfast, lunch or dinner and of course, endless BC we did on various topics and many times, without any topic as well... just completely random.<br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 3<br>He is also popularly known as "gossip boy" of our batch. College ki koi bhi news chahiye ho, Maadooo hai na <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We played TT a few times and he was like, sprinting from one end of the table to the other in excitement thereby hurting himself a few times by falling down. But his attitude was, do anything to win. And it's not just TT, its for everything, be it CAT or organizing events like Felicity or anything for that matter. Cricket should definitely be mentioned in his testimonial. It has been a treat to seeing him from not being in playing 11 of the batch team in first year to being in playing 11 of IIIT cricket team now. His dedication to whatever he does is amazing. In second, third years as well, we remained very good friends but a million thanks to budhau for bringing him in our wing - THE wing as he says <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2<br>As far as I remember, I first met this guy in NBH-146 having some argument with Mridul. What an argument that was !! Legendary I must say <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Later I found out that he was in the same English group (A1) as mine. We used to have all the classes and labs together. We also used to have our meals together and we became good friends quite soon. I found him very sincere, studious, hyper at times and very much dedicated in whatever he used to do. He knew C-programming before coming here and helped me whenever I asked for. A kid at heart .... pata nahi chalega kab kis baat par gussa ho jaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He used to come to Adi's room during exams for asking a few doubts and we used to say " do 10 sit-ups, only then we'll tell u the solution". Poor guy even agreed to do once. At that time, we were definitely good friends but not that close. But I thank God that our friendship grew stronger with time as I found a real good, caring and helping friend in him who will do anything to help you out and get you out of the trouble. At that time, his image was somthing like this - "jab bhi kisi ka kat raha ho, isse dekha nahi jata aur ye apni marvane ke liye beech mein interrupt zaroor karta hai" which remained the same till 3rd year but he changed in 4th year after joining THE wing about which I'll be talking a bit later. So, going back to the first year, he was the guy along with Chand who encouraged me a lot to take part in Hindi elocution competition and I think I must thank him for showing so much confidence in me and encouraging me that time. He was "early to bed and early to rise" kinda guy and tried to remain the same until he could. But his dedication for Felicity made him to leave that practice and I think our whole batch would be thankful to him for organizing the best Felicity IIIT has ever seen. Seriously, he is a perfect blend of amazing organizational skills, hard work, dedication, intelligence and management. I think he'll make a good manager.<br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1: <br>Karan Maroo<br>Karan Mitra<br>Karan Namboodri<br>Karan BLN<br>Karan Bezi<br>Karan Jawahar<br>Karan GAG <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>ye sabka bachcha hai. Inmein se har ek ko apna/apni father/mother figure maanta hai. Har ek ki baat achche se sunta hai aur har ek ka kehna maanta hai. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Maaddoo, Gossip Boy, Babu, Andha, JANICE of course(saale ye tera naam hai mera nahi, mera to Manis hai aur ab to ye baat maine bhi is testi ke through har ek ko bata di hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>ye sab naam ise diye gaye hain because of some reason or the other.<br><br>Iski vidambana ye hai ki ise koi Karan naam se nahi bulata. Har koi ise Maroo/Maaddooo hi kehta hai.<br><br>Here goes a testi for one of the popular guys of our batch but this is not because of his popularity but because of our friendship <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Here it is, to our friendship buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> --> <br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In the end:<br>For me, he is one of my all time best friends in the world. This person is really someone who'll always be there for me, cheer me up, and inspire me.I can blindly trust him. His words and advices really mean a lot to me. I find him really very honest. I can look upto him whenever in need. I can share anything with him. I have really enjoyed all the time we have spent together here. I would have been completely different not just academically but in many other things like interest and probably behaviour as well if he wouldn't have been my friend (Thanks to God for not doing that). I look upto him as my idol (good GK, good English, very sharp, intelligent, sophisticated, down to earth, and what not). He is the guy whom I admire the most in whole IIIT and not just in our batch. I assure you that you can always count on me buddy. Thankfully, you are also in Hyd(the best part is, in the same company) and hence, I won't loose the best company I'm having for the past four years with whom I can enjoy, I can play, I can be senti, I can discuss anything under this world, I can ask any bloody idiot question I want to without any shame. Thanks for being a part of my life here.<br><br>I wish you all the luck for your future. I am confident that you'll reach skies in your career. Go and conquer the world, nobody can stop you. "Sky is the limit" is the correct phrase to be used for you. Be the same as you are because you are the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>But if you are Adi's neighbour, then you got to appreciate rock sooner or later and same is the case with me. We both got an intern in MS where I and Bhalu irritated him a lot. Adi and me made a foosball team as well and we started doing quite well in a few days time. (Hope to continue this after our joining (whenever it comes) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ). Then I got a PPO from MS and I was praying like anything for him also to get the same. Actually, right from the time of Shakti (as we did all our courses and projects together and we were such good friends), I always had a feeling that we'll end up getting a job in the same company which came true when the result for his PPI came affirmative. That is definitely amongst some of the happiest moments of my life. Then of course, late night TT sessions also come in some of the memorable moments. And yes, how can I forget to make a mention of MS party here <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> !<br><br>I also made a law about him by observing a few things sometimes, which says<br>"Whenever Adi gets an opportunity to screw up something, he always screws it up." <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>and the best example is CogSci Term Paper but thank God, that matter got resolved.<br><br>He is also obsessed with Microsoft products (especially LIVE), wikipedia and automobiles. He always tries to get result from live search and only in some special cases, goes to google. This guy is damn sharp and intelligent. He grasps things in a matter of seconds. He is an NTSE scholar. His IIT-JEE screnning rank was 128 which is an achievement in itself. This guy remains fully confident at whatever he does. A perfect gentleman he is. Most of the time, all you can do is admire him for the things he is and will be capable of achieving. I'm proud to have met him. <br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Our friendship grew stronger as time passed. When 3rd sem comes to my mind, Shakti (Beeja di Shakti <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) also comes with it. How can we forget how we made our group (Chand, Vibhav, him and me) by requesting our individual group members and arranging for them some other group members, how hard work we put in to create a simple line using QT, how we spent a whole night trying to find a small bug(variable name matches with some not so famous keyword of QT) in the code etc. This guy never takes tension. We had a discrete maths exam next morning. I was in the library and I knew that he hadn't studied till then(neither did he listen to classes as those were quite boring) and when I returned from the library, I found out that he was sleeping peacefully. We took most of the courses together when all other went for various other streams. We failed at most of the projects we tried to do because of some reason or the other. We took a project under Dr Kannan in second years summer but he wanted us to do something related to research. Whenever we used to go to him, he used to say read this, read that. We didn't find any output coming and hence, lost interest. Then we chose Dr Kishore for summer project which also failed because of his less interest( he asked us to come after 1 month when we went to him and then, we never went <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). He asked us in parallel algo class after nearly 3 months that we were doing some project under him and we were like, what to say now? Then we took a project under Dr Zulu in Compilers where we couldn't get much documentation on Trimaran and hence, we didn't do that as well. But thank God, we finally achieved some success in BTP <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. His testimonial can't be said to be complete without rock. Yes, he is a big fan of rock and he introduced that to most of us. In my first rock show at college, I was sitting in workspace playing Stickcricket as I found that all crap, very noisy and hence, irritating.<br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Maroo used to come to his room for asking doubts a few times and we used to ask him to do a few sit-ups to get his doubts solved <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Once, he even agreed to do that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He saw me crying (when I had an argument with chand at the end of the first sem) aur jab bhi kuch rone ki baat par discussion hota hai aur log bolte hain ki manish ko kabhi rote hue nahi dekha, to kamina har ek ko naach-2 kar batata hai . He also loves arguing and he took part for sometime in famous Maroo/Mridul discussion at NBH-146. I have written this line in Chand's testimonial as well - He and Chand are the two guys whom I can ask even the dumbest thing possible and they would definitely reply back instead of getting irritated or making fun of me.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Going back to the first year, I still remember my first day when we were sitting on a comp in library and he was playing snooker and chatting with some random girl from my newly made yahoo account where I spoiled the fun by telling him not to chat from my account as someone told me that chatting from library comp is not permitted and action might be taken if you do that (What an arbit notion it was ! <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Later I found out that he was my neighbour in the hostel and hence, I found one of my first best friends at IIIT. I came to know a lot about him in a few days time - an amazing guy with awesome general knowledge (our mobile wikipedia), very intelligent, wonderful knowledge of computers, very good English, sophisticated of course and very lazy. One example of his laziness is the Human Desires exam when after the exam he told me that he knew the answer but "aalas ki vajah se likhne ka mood nahi hua". Actually speaking, he is not that lazy but when he comes to laziness, he crosses all of the limits. If you ask him to come for lunch in mess and he says, "haan be, bas naha kar aata hun" .... bas fir to, you have to wait for atleast 40-45 minutes (aisa kya karta hai yaar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). An extremely helpful guy he is. His C-programming was/is very good and I got a lot of my programs debugged from him. For me, he was the labcom (I still feel that he should have been elected as the labcom because of his knowledge and helping nature. ). Whenever I had some doubt(I used to have a lot of those as computer was/is(acc to him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) a mystery box for me.). He only gave the names manish88_a@yahoo and manish88.a@gmail and created the accounts which I have been using till now and will be using in the future also. We (Vibhav, him and me) used to study together during exams in his room. Remember, how we used to laugh sometimes madly and that strangely happened always during exams. <br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If I say that I have spent 2 out of 4 years of my college life in his room, then that won't be much of an exaggeration.<br><br>I first saw this thin guy with specs wearing an ornage colour T shirt(as far as I remember) tucked into a jeans in workspace where our discussion group had to meet for the first time to give our introduction. The first image of him to me was - very studious and a bit show off (as his English and Gk were/are quite good) out of which first one is not completely true(studious but not very studious) but second one is absolutely false. One of my best buddies. I definitely owe my CGPA to him as it was he who used to solve most of my doubts.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In the end:<br>You are a gem brother. I must assure you that you can always count on me. I know we'll remain in touch, so no need to mention that. You have full potential of achieving whatever you want in life. All the best for your future bhai. May God bestow all the happiness and success upon you. And thanks for being with me always.<br><br>I have missed a lot of things. So, this will be updated probably. Writing this testi was an absolute fun. It reminded me of all the BC, fightings, assignments, irritating others, irritating each other, exam preps and all those things we have done together. I don't wanna end this testi so soon as I'm enjoying writing this so much.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>What I think of you?<br><br>I revere you a lot buddy. You mean a lot to me. You have always been my teacher. The credit for my first ever dance performance goes to you. I still remember quite clearly that I could ask you even the dumbest thing without any shame as you knew my level of GK, English and computers. The credit for changing my accent from nOt to nAWt goes to you. You have always been a source of inspiration and confidence to me. "Tu knocks mein to achcha khelta hai, game mein kya ho jata hai", you inspire me with such lines when I actually don't play badminton that well and it does work I have felt. It was you(and Maroo) who gave me confidence to take part in Elocution in first year which fetch me the first position. It's you who increases my confidence and dedication for gymming by saying "You're improving a lot" even if I'm not. It won't be an exaggeration to say that you are the best teacher I have ever met after my parents. You have always stood by me. There are not many people with whom I can share anything but I must say that you are amongst those. You are always there to help me out like an elder brother whenever I get into some trouble. I sometimes imagine what my life would have been in IIIT if you wouldn't have been there for me. I also try to imagine what my life will be when you will be in Bangalore and I'll be in Hyderabad. I have become so much used to you being around to guide me through various things and acting like a protective shell. You are one of the most intelligent, smart, talented people I have known, and your beauty lies in your honesty. One of my all time best friends in the world! Your words and advices really mean something. I can blindly trust you. I know you'll always be there for me. I can always count on you. These 4 years were the most memorable years of my life and you definitely played a very important part in that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 3<br>We shifted to OBH. I got a room on the first floor and he got one on second. Mota was in NBH and he got a room in Chand's wing. I told Chand that I wanted to be in the same wing as him. He suggested me to move to Mota's room and mota could move to mine. I pestered him to talk to mota regarding the same (I didn't talk to him myself). Though mota got angry but still Chand managed to get me that room (thanks a lot buddy). Though he became very much busy with Felicity and Netagiri<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but still we used to have a lot of BC. Then started bakar sessions in OBH wings. We(Chand, Bhalu and me) used to sit outside Maroo's room and do a lot of BC disturbing others. That dumble incident where we were trying to wake Sambhav up from Chand's room was classic. How many people got angry that day! Slapping him and switching off his laptop still continued. I and Vipul made a story as well regarding a messenger thingy. He got angry at Kshitiz once in which my wonderful smile played a very important role <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He got an intern in Gridstone and went to Mumbai for nearly 2-3 months. I missed him a lot then.Then came my PPI about which I wasn't really having much hope but he had full confidence in me. He said that he'll talk to me only after the result came as if he knew what was going to be the outcome but yes, he was right. I think he knows more about me by now than myself. He started boozing more oftenly but never forced me to do that as he completely understands me and my feelings. Then came placement season. His dedication is worth admiring. I was at home and I was literally in tears when I got the news of his placement. How eagerly I was waiting for that news to come. Then we started gymming again and I started competing with him in showing off the muscles (though mine are not even near to him). His going blank thing has already been mentioned by Vipul. This guy leofies others a lot. Mote ki 4 se 5 hone par, bhalu ki tond par jo maari thi, I can never forget that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2b<br>We started listening to rock together and we used to sing "Where did you sleep last night" by Nirvana together at our highest pitch to match the pitch of Curt Cobain (seems quite foolish now, doesn't it? <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). He also sings "Tujhe dekha to ye jana sanam" quite well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. You should listen to him sometime. I still remember how he got senti when I was leaving for my home for 3 months in first summer holidays. I was probably the first guy to witness his anger <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (achcha hai ki iska gussa 5 min hi rehta hai, agar 15-20 min reh jaye, to pata nahi kya ho jaye <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) but I really admire him for his quality of saying sorry (even if it's not his mistake) to ameliorate the situation. He has always treated me like a younger brother and I have treated him like an elder one. Friends generally don't fight with chappals but brothers do and yes, we had a few chappal fights as well in NBH-146 <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I used to switch off his laptop sometimes without any reason and he used to get irritated which I enjoyed a lot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I was quite bad at computers but he and Adi helped me a lot in improving that, teaching me various things from time to time. It was he who installed EA Sports Cricket '07 on my pc (my first ever pc game). I told everyone about Alt-F4 thing as well (poor guy had to bear all that because of me being his roomie <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). I went to gym for a month in summers and he was the guy who used to instill confidence in me from time to time whenever he felt that I needed it. We had a great time in NBH. and yes, it was this asshole only who gave me the name jaat and now many people think that I'm actually a jaat, wtf!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2a<br>I still remember my first day at college when I was looking for a roomie. To my luck, this guy got a room which was locked and had come to warden's office to get it changed. This was when I met him and found out that he too had lived in Hisar(my hometown) a few years back and we became roomies. Seniors used to rag him a lot (he was the guy who said WTF to seniors on the first day of his ragging, so he was their favorite target.). Sometimes they would ask him to bring some new guys for ragging sessions but he never asked me to come as he knew that I didn't like that. We used to do a lot of BC in NBH-146 along with Adi. I still remember that BC in our room when Maroo and Mridul were involved in some discussions (more of a fight) regarding BITS-Pilani. Chand was looking at me and I was looking at him blankly as we both got quite irritated by that meaningless discussion. We have witnessed some such discussions where they would argue over the topics like "on which ball did Sachin hit a six in so and so match which took place nearly 8-9 years ago". We used to revise together in exams time (Remember that C-programming notebook from which we used to read a few important programs (especially that finding subsets of a set) again and again to mug them up so that we won't have to waste our time in exam on thinking those programs). We can't forget those morning time revisions until 5-10 minutes before the start of the exam, going late to classes daily, a habit which was common in both of us, doing extra C assignment together after exams when everyone was enjoying, consoling each other after seeing both of our names in Jawahar sir's list. Shakti can never be forgotten. That night out to find a really small bug in the code, that running to seniors to just create a line using QT, that running to Anurag sir at the last moment when BJ asked us to enable the GUI for n number of nodes.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1<br>My first testi had to be for him - my best friend, guide, teacher, critic, brother and what not. <br><br>About Chand: <br>	Bhai, tera naam kya hai?<br>		Subhashis Chand<br>	Kya ?.... subha ...s ??<br>		Chand bol le yaar .....<br>					that's how he introduced himself to me, though some people claim that he introduces himself as "Subhashis Chand, son of Major A.K. Chand, look at my muscles" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br>One of the most interesting persons that everyone should meet and it'll be hard to forget this wonderful being! From 48 kg in 10th to 96 kg in drop year and then back to 78 kg in engg with good muscles, this guy's dedication definitely deserves a mention in this space. A software engineer who loves arts and is very good in electronics must have left everyone way behind if he would have preferred ECE over CSE and way way behind if he would have preferred arts over engineering. But that's the way life is and he is doing exceptionally well in computers as well. He is a jack of all trades, mastering all of those at the same time. An amazing all rounder anyone could feel jealous off. He is a great leader (presently holding the highest post in IIIT a student can hold i.e. the speaker of IIIT parliament) with fodu communication skills, awesome sense of humour, amazing dancer and mimic, good TT and badminton player, very gregarious I must say, body builder of course and bla bla bla. Bla Bla Bla because his qualities are innumerable (the best allrounder of all those I have ever seen) which a lot of people are going to belabour about in his testimonials but this is not what I'm writing this testi for. This is going to be about him and me, what I think of him, what does he mean to me and some memorable moments of this amazing journey of 4 years.</b></i></ul><br><br>
