<b><a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bhanukiran - extremely sensitive, a passionate singer, promising poet, a very talented actor, always ready to take up responsibilities - he was one of my earliest friends in IIIT-H simply for the fact that I could relate to his sensitivity and innocence.<br><br>Quite a simple and uncomplicated person, his poetry works are quite good [I don't know if you keep writing regularly. If you don't, I suggest you start doign that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />] and reflected the intensity and passion that are the characteristics of his personality.<br><br>Bhanu thinks with his heart and is a very caring and gentle person to talk to. Someone, with an uncorrupted mind, someone you could trust to not misunderstand you and even if he misunderstood, would not stop talking to you.<br><br>Very hardworking and equally daring, Bhanu always speaks his heart out and his social life [unlike mine, I know you would want that aspect of me to change. I assure you it will <img src=Smileys/4.gif />] had been very active during last four years. He gave it his best shot whenever it came to doing something for the students. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Wish you all luck, wherever you go Bhanu.

I admire him for plenty of things. He maintains relation with almost everyone in our batch. We have been planning batch trips rite from the first year, including the one chirkut. I have never felt lonely in his company.<br><br>I remember that he had motivated me and gave me inputs to include in my farewell speech and that had helped me compose a better one.<br><br>And yeah don't forget that Gridstone drama. It was a good experience in all.<br><br>Man work hard for you MS, I know you have a bright future ahead. I am in hyd only so will meet quite often.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My padosi from 1st sem in GHEB. We were adjacent neighbors for first two years in IIIT-H. It had lot of fun troubling him, both intentionally and unintentionally, and see his reaction whenever we interacted.<br>We spent a lot of time chatting in hostel and in classroom. He has been my friend in every semester of the college life, we took many same courses as well. He's a great person but sometimes takes too much stress. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I require a dictionary to decipher his poems! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Seriously dude you write stuff that only experts can read but I know that you put all your emotions and feelings in it, just like any other poet. The theme of and description in your poems is really beautiful, if only I could understand it in first read! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He was my PC partner in workspace as well!<br>He has tried to help me everytime I have asked for his help, be it assignments or lectures.<br>He tells me that everytime I buzz him on gtalk I have a bad news for him... lol !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>You've been a constant part of my life since last 4 years. Thank you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>And congrats, you played a part in my story, "Sleeping in Class" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>  Well to start wid i knew Bhanu as a guy who wanted to get ragged wid seniors nd went to the senior nd asked him "Rag me " <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ..

<b><a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bhana that's what I sometimes call him...<br>Great guy to talk to,hamari mulakat hui jab 1-2 year mein,mein I used to go to gheb to meet Atul and I got to know ki<br>wahan ek aur assignment dene wala bhagwaan rahta hai,bas mulakaat toh honi hi thi...<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bada tense sa dikhta tha us time yeh,waise abhi bhi tense rahta hai kabhi kabhi par ab toh rapchik mast bhi rahta hai many times.Mera<br>interaction toh iske saath mast wala rahta hai,with lots of bad words exchanged<br>mind u not that bad as u might be thinking..<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. His dedication is what I like the most<br>but one more quality is worth appreciable which is his event participating spirit.<br>You can see him in most of the events creating buzz in the campus if not participant<br>then as an audience for sure <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Currently doing his MS but wants to <br>be entreprneur too.Sleeps early, wake up early, go to gym daily, all assignments on <br>time, participate most of the time, plays CZ , SE ka tutor hai, what more you want from a person.<br>Ek baar bas Indic ke exam mein tujhe padaya tha woh bhi pata nahi tu neend mein hi <br>sun raha tha,I know...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bhana gaata bhi hai,poet bhi hai. In short he can be <br>called as a versatile genius.U r creating a niche in everyone's heart and that's the most<br>admirable quality you have.One more quality, oh my gosh bahut sari hai yaar...<br>as I mentioned u earlier too, like me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> u like to appreciate others work...<img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>Bhai jahan bhi rahe online jaroor rahiyo bahut masti karenge...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Hope u get ur MS soon and u become an entrepreneur soon..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first met this guy in workspace sharing a same interest with me i.e. stickcricket as he has already mentioned in my testimonial. Then I used to meet him in gym doing exercise regularly. That time, me and Vibhav used to talk to him a bit. His dedication over there was worth admiring. That time, I left the gym after nearly 20-30 days but this guy continued and when I again joined the gym in fourth year, I found him still there doing exercise regularly and he has definitely improved a lot. This guy wants to take the leadership role in whatever he does and that's quite a good attitude if you can do justice to it. He is a singer and a poet as well. All the best for your MS and all your future endeavours <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish  </b></i></ul><br><br>

I remember this chap from first year days. Whenever some senior asked his intro he'd say "My name is Bhanu Kiran. I come from Hyderabad. Har Ghadi Badal rahi hai roop zindagi (with awesome emotions on his face... I'd say those emotions were even better than Chamiya <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)" and that made him very famous in the campus.<br><br>He's a very emotional singer and an awesome blogger (well, I never read your blog man! seriously. coz I never understand what you write. So I decided to make use of your blog in a different way and I used it to learn GRE words <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and believe me it was a great help.). He's an awesome poet too (again, I don;t really understand it but read it : GRE funda).

But right from the first moment I felt that dept of friendliness in him. And sooner we become gud pals..and I wud come every now and then to his room and chat about my hometown, family and many other things. He talks hindi in a very sweet Hyderabadi accent. I really love to hear you when you speaks hindi in such innocent manner <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> - warna yahan toh logon ki jubaan pe bas kadwi galliyian hi nikalti hai <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.<br>We did many assignments together and I love those dayz when lil tension was there reg submission and each one f us trying to cheer up the mood. <br>Yeah, this dude is very romantic at heart..believe me <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He is great fan of SRK and Madhavan..if I am not wrong. Writes so beautiful and romantic poetry. Those are really great yaar..wud love to get one autographed from u as a gift to me.<br>Those first 2 years that we spent so merrily and having our share of fun are indeed to be cherished forever. This person always supported me right through any panic, dilemma...a friendly advice from him was a tonic to me.<br>It was grt having u friend in IIIT..and let make this friendship forever.
