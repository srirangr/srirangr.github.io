<b><a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>"play boy" as i call him for he has such girl fan base...girls outside iiit are just crazy about him...always on phone speaking to some or other the girl but never does he accept this fact...ninnu anduke srikar,chandu,vam,rohit dengedhi...<br><br>cool headed, charming and the environment that surrounds him is energetic...he knows how to start a conversation well, this might be the reason y so many girls have fallen as prey to him...<br><br>i really enjoy the way thy tease him, but never does he lose his control and just keeps smiling. Feb 14th was celebrated as his birthday as he is considered as the love god and hoped that his blessing will give a girl friend to us...his best slogan "oka ardam undi oka allochanna undi" is truly amazing...if only he cud share his list of girl friends most of our lives would have been settled by now...<br><br>always ready to help and never shies away from challenges...will never get bored in his company and truly he is the poster boy of our batch...has brilliant knowledge about many things be it girls behaviour, food, places or anything...<br><br>feels tensed a bit about his education i feel...and now since he is a prof at LPU ...inka entha mandi girls balli avvutarooo...<br><br>veedi girls tho adukunna anta evadu adukoni unndadu...chandu gadi plan success avvali ani nenu serious ga devvudiki pray chesta...<br><br>all da best buddy...just keep rocking </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sru - this guy is born "for friends" .... a very helping nature guy ... whenever u wanna go out n need a company, this guy is always there ... always matlab always ... i never heard him say "NO" to friends ....<br>one of the huge fan following guy ..... his fans include everyone from young to old, men to women, boy to gal, India to US ... ufff !!!!<br>This guy is really aware of everything !! i dont know which nurse taught him when he was born .... ask him anything .. any place, anything to eat, any movie, any singer .... huh !! and name any gal, he will tell her complete bio-data .... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>u wil find this guy mostly on phone .... in fact always on phone ... there are instances when he was on phone even in bathroom <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>this guy gotta lots of patience, u pester him like anything .. u pester him about anything, any number of times, he is still d same !! cooool dude !!!<br>"love God" of IIIT .... it was really fun on 14th feb'08 .... wow ... especially the celebrations were really very awesome .... the one who missed it missed a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity ... seek his blessings in case u want a better half to be the best half ... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>this was the first guy in IIIT whom i met, our roll numbers differ by only 1 ...<br>one thing is for sure ... u will never get bored of his company ... quite entertaining, quite responsible, quite mature but toooooooo complicated to understand ... a suggestion for everyone, dont try to understand him, u will go mad !!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>just remember one slogan (everyone) - "dont fear when srujan is here" ...<br>but at times this guy is really irritating ... he has got a bad habit of "wanting" attention all d time .. i have observed this many a times dude .... just think over it dude .. may b u dont realize <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>keep d spirit going in u n keep rocking always n lend some *** to me dude <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>I'd like to start my testimonial by saying "Oka ardham undi ... oka aalochana undi" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> which translates to "One meaning! One thought!" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Love God Sunkoju!!<br><br>One of the most important quality of this guy is that whatver you say to him, homuch ever you leofy him, he'll accept everything with a pleasing smile on his face. And me a biiiiig fan of that smile of yours dude. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>I've never seen him angry or aggressive or arguing with anyone at any point of my college life. And that was the main reason behind celebrating "14th Feb" as his birthday. Coz he'd never say anything to anyone and ofcourse the other main reason being the massive fan following for this guy both in and out side IIIT. Which is completely understandable coz girls are always flat over guys with heroic looks (btw did I tell you, he looks like Prabhas. Inkonchem body undi vunte asalu picha keka undedi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and ultra cool nature.<br><br>I've seen this guy working his ass off for Felicity, especially for campaigning. A biig <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to all the effort that you guys have put. I swear I've never seen such a huge crowd ever ever in my life.<br><br>I can never forget the date "14th Feb 2008" <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and all the racha that we did on that day. And all that was possible only because of your humbleness and cooperation. You are truly Love God man! Cupid! <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>All the best for ur future dude. Will miss you a lot.<br><br>Love<br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My interactions with Srujan have been limited to those in virtue of Felicity and the other of him being Chand's former floor mate. All of these times, he came across as soft, shy and affable person. He is not known to open up easily, and in spite of spending a lot of time together for Felicity, he is still very shy. But among his friends, he is a known Cassanova, and I am surprised at that!<br><br>Srujan was one of those guys who worked their asses off for Felicity '08. He was a leading figure for campaigning and hospitality, and his extensive knowledge of Hyderabad and its colleges really helped <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . The funny part here would come when you'd try and explain something to him. He takes a lot of time to understand certain things, repeatedly asks till its ingrained- and its fun to see him doing that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But hats off for all the work you put in <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>All the very best!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Lord Krishna <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: Felicity meetings.<br>Message for him: Try and be more outgoing</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>opinions ranging ...<br><br>from acads to girls,<br>from mess to restros,<br>from love to luck,<br>from movies to marriage,<br>from parents to children,<br>from cricket to uno,<br>from kg to pg,<br><br>add to that awesome summers where we cooked, we partied, the gre classes, the nightouts, the walks....<br><br>there is nothing on earth which we dint discuss, which we dint share with each other, which we dint analyze and what not...<br>we, collectively have made "our" stay most awesome @ iiit-h<br><br>PS: couldnt write individual testi's as our stay has been so much inter-woven that all our social lives has been the same for most part of it...<br><br>will miss you people here...<br><br>For you: tension padaku.. ikkada emi adaganu le.. but sharing is a good habit.. and nuvvu enta mandito matladutavo.. ekkadekkadiki potavo.. emem chestavo.. maku telidu.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Too mature and too complicated to understand.. but for girls he is the kool hot bod.. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>cheers,<br>rohit </b></i></ul><br><br>
