<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br>...He is really skilled at his field and it was terribly disappointing to see company after company not appreciating his expertise. But all's well that ends well, and I'm really happy for you for your job in LPU. I hope you remain in the teaching field, as I think you already have made a good teacher. Also, I can't imagine you living the typical city life in such big cities. I think the peaceful environment of a small town university campus will suit you just fine, and I'm very happy for your placement. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Stay in touch. Kabhi bhi Jammu side aaya toh LPU aa ke zaroor visit karoonga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Memories:</b> The patience with which you solved people's problems.<br><b>Message:</b> Bhai kabhi mess mein bhi kha lia karo.<br><b>In ten years' time, I'll see you as:</b> Prof. Bharat Sankhlecha.<br><b>Tags:</b> Roomie, ECE, laptops, LPU.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><br><b>Bharat, my room partner in 2nd year.</b> The only person I have ever shared a room with. And in fact, I am the only person he has shared a room with. And the two of us have been living in hostels for the past seven years now. Wow! it was nice to have noticed that in our final moments of B.Tech.<br><br>Bharat bahut hi shaant kisim ka helpful sa banda hai. For whatever time I was there, juniors always kept thronging our room to meet up with Bharat sir, the robotics expert. He has a queer walk, and some times I used to get the impression that he himself has become a robot, so much he was into robotics.<br><br>He wasn't very good at reading, but had exceptional interest in 'doing' work. Extremely dedicated to his subject, he has been one of the premier ECE lab TAs from our batch. He has a special interest in the practical aspects of Electronics, and is nice enough to help anyone with any laptop problems. He just told me today that he had opened about 50-60 laptops in IIIT. Hats off for all this you keep doing for us, Bharatiya <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Up personal, he comes across as a person who likes his space. He lives in NBH, away from the hullabaloo of the batch. Kept the room cleaner than me, and never once complained, although I must have done some chutiyaapa or the other. In fact, I did used to play the guitar in his room, but then too he never complained. Because of the fact that he had Thakurjee in his almirah, I never smoked in his presence, and made it look like I never did. But you know that there were times that I did. 5-7 times, maybe. Yaad nahi. <br><br><i>contd.</i></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bharat or Bhartu, as sed to call him, is one of my first friends in college. There was a time when he was my best friend. But things changed so very much that now we don't even talk. Its not like that we had a fight or something but the circumstances were such that we drifted apart. I remember when we studied together for exams in his room. I used to roam around with him and do lots of BC. I had a great time with him in the initial days of my college life. My first outing was also with him to Koti to buy books.<br><br>But as soon as I became a part of TB, a started spending less time with him and thats when actually our friendship took an opposite turn. I seriously regret this now because I never wanted to lose him. But now when I look at him, it feels very good to see that he is doing great in his academic life. He has also changed a lot and looks like he has matured a lot. <br><br>I'll always remember him as my first friend and he'll always be my friend no matter we talk or not. I hope its the same for him too.<br><br>May god bless you to reach great heights in future. Good luck for whatever you do. You can always count on me and I'll always be there to help you out. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>bharat bole to chhota bharatiya...<br>Jo accha lagta hai woh poore mann se karta hai baaki ko lyt le leta hai. Bharat pai ne Robocamp mein as a co-ordinator raat-2 jaag kar kaam kia tha <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I remember ki VLSI course mei bande ne bahut mehnat ki thi duniya bhar ki books pad li thi, paper bhi publish kia tha lekin MB ki random grading ne bharatiye ko B de dia. Hardware side inka special interest hain <img src=Smileys/26.gif />. Batch mein pata nahi kitno ka hi laptop theek kie hain aur saath hi saath pizza party bhi li hain <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Robotics mein bhi kaafi knowledge hai bande ki. Jab hi microprocessor se related kuch cheez hoti hai to sab bharatiye ke paas pahunch jaate hai.Banda 3 baar se EW ka TA hai. <br>Mess mein khana inhe pasand nahi 40% of the time bahar khate hain especially Santosh dhaba or chinese with his default partner subroto sen <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bahar ye daba kar khate hai lekin bajan sirf 55kg. Nanhi si jaan lekin Harsh par haath chalata hain <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Hyderabad ka chappa-2 pata hai yadi bharatiye ne bol dia ki is raaste se jaana hai to bas aankh band karke chale jao. Jainism ke baare mein bhi kaafi knowledge hai. Ek raaj ki baat hai lekin bata hi deta hun ye hamare college ka one of the playboy bhi hai pata nahi kis kisse baat karta rehta hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . Beta bod shoddy bana le meri tarah nahi to lovely mein jaat pareshan kar denge.<br>Best of luck for your future plans <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ambati aka Bharatia ... the rajasthanni, always busy in something, have no time for ece friends. I think tere girl-friends ece friends se jyada hai. neways you are the Laptop service centre of IIITH, at a very cheap cost ie only a pizza. Eats a lot, also goes to restaurant almost everyday. Always there to accompany me for santosh dhaba. The one who is always confused between MS and Job. Shayad hum mein se sabse jaldi teri hi shaadi hone wali hai, bulaio zaruur. Ab ke baad se hum ise Prof Bharat bulaya karenge. Mere acche-bure waqt mein hamesha saath dia hai, jaisa bhi hai waise hi rehne ki koshish kario.
