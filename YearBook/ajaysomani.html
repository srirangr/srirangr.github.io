<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Somani is THE CODER of the batch .. Has more fucking achievements than bristles in my toothbrush. We bonded quite well in 1st year, be it the RAM incident, or the virus incident, or the uncountable nightouts in workspace. When in second sem he got a laptop, Me and he used to play NFS like hell <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . That was helluva of time <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . After that in summers, we both decided to stay back, As far as I remember, He introduced me to topcoder. We used to praticse a lot in cvit lab <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, but he was more dedicated then me obviously <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .<br><br>I will still remember the way we used to threaten people for a coding challenge in the chat rooms and beat the hell out of him.  I also remmber how prasanna fkd us, and how we and prasanna became friends after that <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . Thanks to prasanna, we started spoj.<br><br>He used to give up his sleep and do spoj <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . It was difficult fr me as I was not as dedicated as he was. I still remember the FAST multiplication problem, how he used to tell me the various approaches and how I initially used to deny that his approach is not that fast. But his dedication made him solve the problem in a matter of few days, now he will do such problems in less than a minute <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . <br><br>After that, he became more dedicated towards programming. Me being less dedicated and lazy, stopped participating <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>Even then, I used to meet him nearly daily and used to pull his leg like hell <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>We have played lots of games togeter be it CS, NFS , Age etc. Har cheez mein dedication dikata hai saala <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>Google intern was a nice stay for me thanks to him. All leofying sessions on that NITW chutiya were really awesome. Checking out girls in the cafe and also checking their profiles and showing frustooness <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Those night outs with Rahul Bansal and my mentor, those outings in F-Bar, Club 8,haveli etc . <br><br>Thanks for inspiring me to code, I wouldnt have had any prog achivements without your initial push in first year. </b></i></ul><br><br>

I've seen him solving problems and typing codes as fast as giving the verbal instructions to smone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>He has this attitude of 'not caring' much about what others say or do.. he likes to be busy and involved in his own life.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>But we always pick on him whenever he is around.. and he's become sporty over time.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>The one thing I'll remember him for are all those outings to GC .... for he's always ready whenever it's about going out for food <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>I can certainly see a really bright future for him.... the only thing I want him to improve are his PR skills <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  <br>and do learn to put a smile on your face <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers !!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I didn't really want to write a testimonial for this person but I think its a social obligation and I have to do it. I know on reading this stuff he will surely say, "Kya C******* hai???".<br><br>This is one of the few guys who makes my life possible at IIIT. In his absence I would have very few people with whom I can share the non-social part of my life.<br><br>I met him in the first year itself as we used to spent nights in the workspace together. In the beginning phases of my life at IIIT, I was damn interested in coding and all that was due to this guy. He was a great source of inspiration for me upto 3rd semester and we used to be together almost all the time and used to spend time coding for fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But one fine day, I realized that I can't be as good as this guy and moved on. <br><br>I am not going to list his achievements here as its a never ending list. But this guy has is damn good combination of hard work and intelligence which makes him perfect in whatever he does.<br><br>Keep in touch !!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Haan bhai Somani. Everyone knows hes the best coder, a fodu champion etc etc. Won't dwell much into that. What I'll narrate is a small incident.<br><br>It was the first day of programming lab, and Somani was sitting besides me. Now on that day, the PCs were not working and the TAs were trying to work a way around it. Somani was doing something frantically with his PC. When I asked him about it, he said, "Abe agar sab ka nahi chal raha to thik hai, lekin sirf hum logon ka nahi chal raha to chutiyapa ho jaayega. Mein kuch miss nahi karna chahta hoon." Bhai, hats off for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Recently, in Felicity '09, Pagare and I went to participate in Quick and the dead. We entered tha lab, saw Somani sitting there and immediately turned back. Well, thats Somani for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I admire him for the amount of dedication and hard work he puts in to whatever he does. He loses sleep, spends all his time in the lab but makes sure that his objective is achieved. Google deserves you, and I'm sure you'll make it very big.<br><br><b>Fav memory: Chatting in workspace in first year.<br>Message for him: People will admire you more if you're less haughty </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Somani bhai, coding genious <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I have never seen a bettre coder than him. He must have won more awards in different coding competitions than the number of codes I have written in my entire life till date. His speaking style is quite unique. Very lazy though he loves to do BC whenever he gets time from coding. You utter his name and the one word that comes to your mind is "Coding". You might feel that I have used coding so many times in this testimonial but this is what he is and it is the one thing that describes his complete personality. I feel he does everything by writing a code for it. He is the most deserving guy to be placed in Google <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Bhai there is life outside coding world and it has many more things to offer. just come out of your closet and enjoy the life.<br><br>God Bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>When genius meets hard work, we get Ajay Somani... he's the youngest student and perhaps the best coder of UG2K5 batch. One of the first persons I met in IIIT, Ajay used to get ticked off at my pessimistic attitude and PJs, and in a<br>squeaky voice used to shout at me, "abe chup ho jaa yaar", "kya BC hai ye" etc.<br>I used to see Somani study on the night before exam and used to come to me for asking the syllabus, be it mid-sem or end-sem! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> After half an hour or 1 hour I found him sleeping in his room, with book lying beside him. Next morning<br>some 1 hour before exam, he used to wake up Atul and asked him to teach. After few exchanges of forbidden words, the lecture session used to start and I used to see Ajay listening attentively, learning everything then and there, and managing to get atleast a B in that course by the end of the semester. This made me think that he's some kind of a mastermind.<br>I had to change my opinion when I witnessed his fast and gradual progress in the coding contests, his session of coding continuously which sometimes used to span a few days. His hard work did pay off.<br>He said he didn't like to study, and I later realized that he liked using his mind to solve problems and make strategy when I saw him playing games like CZ, Unreal etc.<br>What I would like to take from him is his ability to accept challenge and solve problems, make efficient strategies etc. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>hmm i remember one incident abt this guy which i doubt even he remembers.<br><br>All of us the entire wing was being ragged in one senior room (*** room). At that time all of us were watching <b>Boys</b> famous Telugu movie. Then suddenly even somani was requested to join the ragging.

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Ajay Somani, Innocent boy, Little Master, is the youngest and best coder of IIIT-H and probably All India  Used to win coding competition every day. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is arrogant,<b> maha aalsi</b>, hardworking , smart fodu and very competitive.Altough much younger than us, still acts much smarter than many of us.<br>	First year he used to be in the lab all the time. Always trying some shell scripting and other things to fool people around. Crashed hard disk of his lab PC and keep wondering for some idle PC. Because of him, many AOE games are delayed in first year <img src=Smileys/14.gif />  He was mainly known to me (that time) for sleeping in class and AOE. He sits in first row and sleeps <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Comes the summer'07, he spend lot of time with us. He was a integral part of Summer'07. We always used to call him for everything , mainly because of his expression and comments which make us laugh like anything. 3rd year he shifted to rum in front of me. Often ends up doing BC in my rum. Been part of many walks and outings with him. Specially GC ke liye toh hamesha ready rehta hain. Wahaan free ke papad jo milte hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Always keeps status message which makes you laugh <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Wheneven I come online first thing I do is to check his status, its always entertaining. He loves to read all those articles in Google Reader and even made me addicted to that thingy. Bahut bada frustoo hain yeh. 200/- ke liye ek aisi bandi ko propose kar chuka jo iske uppar baith jaaye toh yeh mar jaaye <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Only watches HD videos of <i> pyaar-mohabbat </i> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>	He was addicted to Taash during summer'08 and 4-1. Hamesha ping karta rehta tha khelne ke liye. I guess because of him, we used to play cards that much. When playing, he focuses more on whose deal is this rather than playing game. He has became an expert in the game now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and its hard now to fool him <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Computer games mein playing CZ with him is kinda fun. In map snow, if you take sniper he will keep crying for it <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> AoE mein he gets you in first 20 mins, if not then he will depend on his partners for everything <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Galli cricket in Cellar and OBH will be memorable because of his outstanding comments and batting. Used to score a lot for the time. <br>      He knows how to get things done. He is really BOND in that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Knows how to fool anybody, testimony to that is the fact he fooled Julu <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />.He got intern opportunity from both Google and MS <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Was a big fan of GOOGLE. Praises the company for little things they do. While his intern at GOOGLE, we visited the campus several times. He became pro in foosball. Often challenges to play 3 versus 1 and  defeats us <img src=Smileys/20.gif />.	During placement I used to bug him whenver , I struck. and he not only gives answer to that question, he tells me some other question and there superb solutions. Often send me links of wiki, topcoder etc. for refernce purposes for placements. The way he tought during placement classes, I think no one in IIIT can do that job, better than that. Thanx dude, for all that <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>	<br>Is a big time dreamer but I know you will achieve everything you had dreamt of.
