<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>helloshikha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Whenever I see her I say that only <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>She is a sweet and smart gal. <br><br>We stayed in the same floor till now and had a gr8 time with her. In first yr we stayed little close but after that working in different fields n areas, n opting for diff courses, made us busy with our work but even then we had a gr8 time together during our wingie parties n stuff <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Very helpful gal and doesn't interfere in others matters and always try to help others. <br><br>Awesome thing that she got into google for her hardwork and dedication <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>All da best dear n stay in touch <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bhanu the most sincere person and has a very very confident personality!!

<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sush <br>always gave me a push<br>in the exam rush!!<br><br>I remember my first yr when we both used to discuss lot of concepts just before going to write the exam. Be it coding or whatever, she used to explain anything with loads of patience and even if u ask her to repeat more number of times, she has that patience. Thanks a lot dear <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Very very dedicated and she never give up!! Has a lot of interest to go around the globe. Takes no pain in going home almost every weekend. <br><br>If she trusts someone, she never makes them to go down! <br><br>Worked with Ramya(she stays next to my room), I can easily figure out if Sush is there in Ramya's room. The way they discuss man!! <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> Even sometimes during deadlines, the discussion keeps on going till morning. Works very very hard.<br><br>I go upset with Sush, the way how she eats. Doesn't eat anything except fruits. Doesn't take breakfast and dinner properly <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br>The most upsetting part(but Sush don't hate me bcz of this and feel bad ok? ) Whenever she is upset or angry, she takes revenge by not eating food. Never understand why u do like this. Suddenly she throws the food in her plate and walk off.<br>You shud change girly in this sense!!<br><br>But very very caring and sometimes childish too. Had a gud time with you Sush. US lo kummei!!! Go girly!!<br><br>Luv u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Always in a very stable manner and awesome confidence!! Learnt many things from her and she is very very patient. In the second yr when we took graphics, as she told already, I paired up with her for one assignment but actually I never regretted for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I liked working with you to b frank.<br><br>I feel very sad when I see her not getting sleep and also during situations when she doesn't understand what we people talk in telugu.

<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>KD the sweet rowdy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> always in the highest excitation state and more energy!! <br><br>To be frank I never had the chance of interacting with her more till my 3rd yr. We used to play badminton almost everyday and it was a real fun to be with her. But I dont know what happened later she became busy and we stopped playing <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> She is the best trainer in a way I shud say <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>She is an owl <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> and always we can see her going to bed early in the morning and we can again see her may be around 8 or 9 in the evening in the mess <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Srry of course she attends classes <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) We went to comad and in the trip it was so funny to be with her... always keeps cracking jokes and one thing I like in her is the way how she presents herself(dressing) in any situation. Never try to imitate and she is stylish in her own way!! go buddy!!<br><br>Very intelligent girl <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The most hilarious event happened with her was the time she took to travel from her house to IIIT in mid may last yr in the HOTTEST SUMMER <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> lol<br><br>All the best KD!! We'll have gr8 fun for one more yr da!!<br><br>Luv u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sahiti.html>Sahiti Polishetty</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If I need to describe her in a single sentence, <br>"she is a beauty with brain!!"<br>Very down-to-earth personality which I like the most in her!!<br>Wishing you loads of luck dear!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>the most cutest, sweetest, lovely, adorable, n I don't know there are many more adjectives which describes her... she is the best singer. She is very caring and very helpful. First impression was... does she ever talk to anyone but I was absolutely wrong in my thinkin n she is the one who mingles with everyone. She is a very easygoing person and doesn't take most of the things to heart. She is very straight forward in nature and doesn't keep anything in heart <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> but if she wants to tell that something is bad or wrong, she immediately tell about that without talking at the back.<br>I really admire her for the way how she reduced her weight <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> If she wanted to achieve something shez gonna strive hard to achieve it. She is very funny too sometimes. <br><br>I had and hope I'll have the same very good time with you buddy. <br><br>Our trips to throwball tournaments, conferences, etc were so amazing without u they might've been very incomplete....hope we'll enjoy the same till we leave this campus n till v r done with our theses work <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>luv u loads sweety!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deeps is how I call her...the most serious and the most hardworking, sincere, blah blah blah....I always remember our first yr memories, stayed on the same floor, our physics discussions <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> n<br>especially the way how she used to work hard <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>She is very caring, lovely, easygoing and sometimes little serious too.... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Drinks a lot of coffee huh...die hard fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S n ROCK music....<br><br>All together she is an lovely girl and I really enjoyed her company especially during our EPP preso.<br><br>And I forgot, last but not the least <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> -- I'm really jealous of her hair <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>Luv u loads dear <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All da best!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shalini.html>Shalini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Shalda is the name given to her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> She is one of my best buddies. The time we had together was awesome and so memorable. <br>I can memorize all the funny things we've done together. We both share many similar qualities especially in the food sense <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>We've started interacting with each other during our project under Mr.Pingali <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> in our 2nd yr. From that time till today we stayed together as good frends. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>I always pull her leg and irritate her the most but everytime she take so lightly and stays beside me. <br>During fourth yr we became very close friends. Our wonderful discussions and the type of stupid questions she used to ask me... I'll miss them <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Shez very very cool.<br>I never believed that she will eat in Yukthahaar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Once upon a time she used to dislike the food made in Yukthahaar but the summer session has brought a gr8 change in her. Also she started recently, spending most of her time watching movies and TV shows <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> which are making us very angry. Whenever we call her for lunch or dinner, she always say 5 mins( and 5 mins in her language means 1 hr or more than that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ).<br>Our new attempts and discoveries everything am gonna miss Shalda <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Hope we'll be together. I had an awesome time with you and am gonna miss you a lot buddy <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>Luv u loads sweetheart.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vvelagapuri.html>Vamshi Velagapuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I know him for the past 6 yrs as a geeky guy with a fiit-jee material always in his hand in Nellore and here making fantabulous websites and working under Prof. Govindarajulu. Very funny guy and extremely cool person <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All da best dude!!<br>Have a wonderful life ahead!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=svimjam.html>Srikanth vimjam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is my classmate since higher secondary <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Very decent and a nice guy. As some one mentioned earlier... yeah I too agree that he'll become a gud Prof <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>All da best dude!!<br>Have a wonderful life ahead!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;<br>She is a very very sensitive girl I've ever seen. But she is very very sweet n cute. She is very sincere in every work she handle. <br><br>I didn't interact much with her till 3rd yr. But the times we actually spent together starting from our "wing party"(hope u remember it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) till today, it was very nice. Especially our trip to Bombay for COMAD was awesome!! I never forget that wonderful time in my life. <br><br>I wonder always <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> how cum she can sing any telugu song and if she participates in telugu antakshari, her team will bag the first prize. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Her blogs are wonderful thats why I call her with a sweet name "Bloggy" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>She is younger to me but she always treats me like a little kid <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Thanks Anups for that. Since we'll be here for 1 more yr, lets have the gr8 time!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All da best buddy!<br>Luv u loads sweetheart <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of my best buddies of my life. We've spent 6yrs studying together. I never know that after my higher secondary I'll study along with her in the same college. When we met for the aieee counselling in NITW, I was so excited that we both got admission from the same University. <br><br>Well, she is a very nice girl and very funny too. One thing I get angry up on her is, whenever we ask her to accompany us, the same old answer is "assalu opika ledhe".. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> she always used to ask us to wake her up in the morning for PT, but when we do, we've got the same answer or "naaku assalu ontlo baaledhe" <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Got fed up with the same answers every time. But she is a very funny girl. <br><br>She is very caring and actually tries to help everyone in need. Talks a lot. And her sense of humor.... hilarious!!! <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>She is one of the few people who are actually very close to me and always used to give her best to help me. <br><br>Hope u'll remember me no matter you make new frends in your life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Luv u loads sweety.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Whenever I remember Nammu, I always remember her cute way of narrating stories. She describes wonderfully different stories during our so called "evening walks". She has awesome communication skills <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>She is very optimistic and tries to stay calm in every situation. Sometimes little excited too like a small kid which is very cute <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>We stayed in the same floor since first yr and since that time, I always had a very nice time with her. I remember it was the first time I ate panipuri because of her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>Other side of Nammu...., she is crazy about Tennis and Football. No one believes that there were days she used to set her alarm and used to woke up around 3 AM and watched some football match or Tennis <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Strong supporter of Federer!!<br><br>She understands others very well and at the same time very straightforward. Her way of managing things is amazing!! Its really a gr8 fun to be with her. <br><br>I'm gonna miss <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> all wonderful and interesting discussions, debates, ice-cream time @night and most importantly our gym exercises <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  <br><br>All the best buddy!!<br><br>Luv u loads.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Here goes my testimonial girly....<br><br>There are days filled with laughter and tears, spent with my dearest buddy. I can write as much as I can but I'll restrict myself. I have no much interaction with her till my 3rd yr. It was then when we both decided to work under Prof. Pudi. Yeah I now remember... in 2-2 we both took "sanskrit" and there started our so called "studying together" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> thingy and in the summer 2007, we stayed here and took seperate projects under Prof. Kamal. Slowly we interacted a little and soon became very gud frends. <br>Starting with our honors project, till today I worked with her(thanks Navs for putting confidence in me to be my project partner.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )on many projects. Starting from 3-1 till 4-2 I remember almost every single moment that we spent together.<br>She is a person who is extremely cool and always bindaas <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> you won't believe there were days when she actually started preparing just one hour before the exam and still stayed so confident and ultimate cool <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> To be frank she helped me a lot to reduce my tension and to be cooler than before <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Thanx Navs...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>And now comes the sleeping marathon. Phew... I don't know how she is going to manage in the future but its a very very tough job to wake her up <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Her constant response to my sincere effort is always, "Lyddu just gimme five minutes. See I've set the alarm also". But it was fun to wake her up <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>In our friendship, I never remember a single incident where actually hurt me except once in 4-2 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>She is very excited about sports and cult events. She doesn't seem to be very dedicated but actually she is!! If she thinks to do anything she actually strives hard to get it. Also she is the most happening girl of our batch and an all-rounder too.<br>Tears are rolling out from my eyes to think about our parting. She is a friend who is always there for you in need. She is the one who understood me very well and with whom I can share anything and everything. She was there with me during my sickness, joy and suffering. I always used to irritate her with all my stupid jokes n activities (thanks Navs for being so patient with me).<br>I'm very very sad to say her gud bye <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> I'LL MISS HER A LOT. Hope wherever we go, we'll be together.<br>Luv u loads sweetheart <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
