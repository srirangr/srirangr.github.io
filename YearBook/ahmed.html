<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Asrar bhai congrats for your wonderful publication. Right from the first semester I kept asking to mingle up with as many as possible. chill out with your batchmates. But he preferred to be kinda reserved.<br><br>But yes onething is true you go to him anytime for help, he will never say no to you. Infact I remember for C and DS assignemtns, we often used to rush to him for help. Lekin aksar ye sirf dhingra ko batata tha.<br><br>Inshallah tum life mai khub progress karo aur ek ke baad ek paper publish hote rahe. lekin ye nahi ki mujhe bhul jaao. khuda aafiz!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Asrar</u><br><br>You ask me, if its possible to personify silence and calmness, my answer would be very simple, I would just ask you to meet this person. Even when he speaks, you have to strain every muscle in your ear to listen to and comprehend what he is talking about!<br><br>A guy for whom work and study seem to be the only time pass in life. He seems to be doing quite well for him in the academic field. After all these years when I look at him, all sincere and studious. I feel a very different sensation that his was the room where I did BC for the first time in IIIT ,when I didnt even knw what BC was. Quite unexpected given that I have never EVER had any BC session with him again, and have rarely talked to him since 3rd or 4th sem. Actually don't  even remember seeing him except the common classes of the whole batch!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>At times I have felt that he is not as colourless as he always portrays him to be, but unfortunately didnt interact much with him to discover more about this <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future man.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>An advice :- Though I know speech is silver and silence is Golden, but please start speaking up for a change <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b><br><br>Cheers!! </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>First time met him in English class in 1st sem. The only thing I could get from him initially was a sweet smile. Later I realized his friendly nature and intelligence and I often ask him one thing that how does he manage to watch so less (movies and sitcoms) and read so much (news and research papers/books).<br>Contrary to popular beliefs he doesn't study much but he loves reading news articles, its his hobby. A few times I have made him watch Two and a half men and he politely agreed that it was good, he did laugh at few instances but never got addicted to it like I did. He still prefers to watch friends once in a while.<br>I did enjoy after dinner chatting sessions with him, sometimes we were joined by Aniket, in which case the session remained as a serious discussion, sometimes by mohit in which case we all shared few laughs now and then, and sometimes by Dhingra and mohit, in which case we shared some information now and then and mostly<br>laughed and did good amount of BC (Baat Cheet, for the uninformed).<br>He always gives me interesting news articles to read and I show him interesting sitcom episodes, I think its a fine give and take. We often discuss future possibilities in Heroes.<br>I have got some good feedback from him whenever I've discussed my idea with him for a course project or for a research paper, which eventually made me reject the idea. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>Oh, the maggi! He's the one because of which I've had the priviledge of having maggi once in a while in IIIT-H, although his stove is mostly kept in Mohit's room. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>One last thing... He listens to all my crap about my hopeless future and my reasons to do a PhD, or to become a millionaire at 25 and retire at the age of 30, none of which makes any sense but he doesn't complain. Hence, he's a good listener as well, others in this case would not have survived.<br>A very helpful person and a good friend. I only wished you interacted more with people.<br>What I would like to take from him is his interest in world affairs and his ability to not get addicted to watching TV sh</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Very calm and down to earth guy .. very studious as well .. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .. all the best asrar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>bahut hi sahi insaan hai ye.. bahut hi badhiya banda hai .. bahut hi softly baat karta hai ..baaki to pata hai hi ki he works really hard and apne mein hi magan rahta hai .. very helping person and has good thought process.. I remeber those time when we had lots of discuss about random topics..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Well Asrar he believes in the saying "Let your actions speak for you". <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a hardworking, dedicated and a very soft spoken person. Our friendship has been like a constant line without any curves over the past four years and i hope it continues the same way next year. He will also probably be the first guy from ug2k5 batch in CDE lab to get his thesis approved. Claps in advance <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
