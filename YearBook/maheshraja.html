<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mahesh - a very cool guy who used to sit beside me in classes. We used to have chats on various topics. This guy is very intelligent. We had to share the systems in workspace but he always gave me the system whenever I was in need. Thanks for that buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All the best for all your future endeavours.

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met this chap for the first time during our SE presentation because he was my group partner. Then only I came to know about his bundle of intelligence and joy. He is very freindly and helpful. He thinks very analytically and woerked very hard for the presentation. Frankly speaking if he would not have been with us, we would have been totally fucked up in SE. Now whenever we see each other, we share a smile and usually a small talk about whats happening in our lives. Always it has been really nice talking to him.<br><br>During the MS internship interviews phase, when I heard that he was not selected it was very shocking for many of us. I always thought of him as an extremely intelligent guy and when he was rejected, it was really unexpected. But as expected he got placed in a good company with a decent package.<br><br>My best wishes for you buddy. God bless you always <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Raja => Kasi<br><br>This guy is thoda sa different from the normal crowd. He doesn't like girls in skirts and make up and all. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> He likes only desi girls(mama .. Pune lo chala mandi untaru.. edaina help kavalante call me.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> pandaga chesuko <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ).<br><br>Once he watched a Marathi movie with me and I didn't ever have to stop/rewind the movie and explain to him what scene was going on. I know that people who know Hindi properly will also sometimes get confused/blank while listening to Marathi dialogues. But this guy is like Awesome!!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Loves rap too. (just like me) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Loves physics too. (not like me) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Doesn't like girls in skirts (oh! come on dude.. obviously not like me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br><br>He's a biig <b>KASIIIII</b> (not like me)<br><br>I still remember during in our 2nd year, Sharat was thinking about something and needed help. And then Raja comes in and gives him some awesome idea without even listening to what Sharat was trying to say completely. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>All in all a real wierdo(as said by Karan) but an interesting person to know.<br><br>Keep rocking in Pune and all the very best for your future mama..<br><br>Love<br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Among the weirdos I've seen, Mahesh is right up there!<br><br>He is brilliant when it comes to creative thinking and problem solving. Whenever I see him, he seems to be lost in his own little world, possibly trying to figure out the solution to some kind of a problem. If hes not, he responds with a hi and a smile <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>One thing I've noticed is that he is never punctual for anything! Even when he received a final offer from ZS, I'd to call him thrice.. He made everyone wait for close to 15 minutes, close to a breaking point! <br><br>Wish you all the best man!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Calling and congratulating him for ZS.<br>Message for him: Punctuality mate! </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>mamaa.. i hardly had any interaction with him for the last two years.... Looking forward to a greater interaction in the coming days.. Stay in touch raaa.... <br><br>From what i could see, he is a very hard working guy, with very good analytic skills, can give good  speeches too(Remember we were both in A1)..<br><br>I get a feeling that you are yet to  reach your full potential in IIIT. To put it in other words, you are yet to perfom to the fullest of your skills.  I sincerly hope you will persue your dreams and be the best at what you are doing. <br><br>Pardon me, if i'm totally wrong. <br><br>All the best raa <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Raja is one guy who stands for the thought <i> " Speak less and think more". </i> Chaala varuku he tries to think about facts presented. He has good analytical skills.
