<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>sab kuchh mila ke dekhein to banda ekdum stud hai. 1st year se le k ab tak isne apne aap ko improve hi kiya hai har field mein. isliye bande k liye mere dil se respect aati hai.<br><br>aur ab kya likhoon main....itni faaltu taareef to kar di hai....aur by jove, time bhi 10:10 ho gaya hai. mujhe baaki logon ke liye bhi likhna hai<br><br>Awesome!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><b>Atul Dwivedi</b><br><br>My first memories of Atul go back to the ragging period in 2005, when we used to live in the same wing in GHEB. Atul, Kapil, Somani and I used to discuss each and every ragging incident back then. Even in those initial days, one could easily observe the simplicity and enthusiasm with which he carried himself. However, not many would have bet on Atul to become what he is today....the best all-rounder of our batch. <br>Although I am not an avid writer, like many others, I have my own style of writing, and all other testimonials that I write shall comply with it. <br>par atal ke liye to bhai k style mein hi likhna chahiye....kyun bhai?!?<br>Atul Dwivedi aka Atal aka Atal <b>Cock</b> aka DVD aka Chhadaami aka Rock aka Avant Ga*** <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>atal sahab ki jitni taareef ki jaaye utni kam hai. matlab, banda ekdum cheeta kism ka hai. shuru shuru mein main isey ek kitaabi keeda samjha karta tha, but ye banda mast nikla. padhai ke saath duniya bhar ki extra-curricular activities ki hain isne college mein....aur uske baad sabmein phoda hai. basketball bhi khelta hai bhai but maine isey kabhi bhi jeette hue nahin dekha bb mein <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>aur by jove, CS to kya khelta hai banda...matlab kamaal hi hai bas. CS khelte hue Atal ka sirf ek funda rehta hai....uss team mein chale jao jahan saare studs khel rahe hon aur jeet pakki ho. aur phir baad mein sabke saamne hawa maaro. waise main jitna bhi bekaar khelta houn, but atal ko maine itna maara hai ki bas.<br><br>ab baat ye hai ki ye naam Atal <b>Cock</b> kaise pada. to bhai aisa hua ki mess mein sab iski Atal Atal kar ke maar rahe the. to ye ekdum bol pada....kya Atal Atal...saala Satal (i mean, shuttle). to bas, phir kya tha shuttle cock se khelte hain, hum Atal Cock se bhi khelne lag gaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But bhale iski sab kitni hi kyun na maarte hon, ye banda hai bada mast. by jove, hanste hanste sabko deta rehta hai apni. try bahut karta hai lene ki, but le nahin pata <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</i></b><br><br>While one talks about him being careless and weird, it is easy to forget all the good qualities that come with Aniket. He is among the most innovative and enthusiastic guys around, has remained completely dedicated to his house and college for most part of these four years, is one of the best athletes in college, maintains one of the best blogs in college, and most important of them all, he is a true friend. He is one of the few people I can always count on in times of need.<br>When it comes to studies, he is one of the more intelligent guys around. His command in the verbal section in the mock CATs was simply exemplary. As far as the acads in college are concerned, after screwing every mid-sem examination, he starts visiting the college library regularly. However, he never pursues this interest for long and the same story continues over the next mid sems. Of late, he has been deeply involved in subjects such as cognitive science, some usability crap etc...<br>In the end, I just want to tell you that I'll always cherish our friendship and all the great moments we have spent together. Never change, never stop <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Things I will never forget: Tullu walking into the wing, hand on his chin, puzzled, and in deep thoughts; his peculiar style of laughing; his love for chicken <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>18th April 2009</b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</i></b><br><br>Well, as I go about the task of putting my feelings and experiences over the past four years into words, I could not have found anyone better than <b>Aniket aka TULLU</b> to start with. And as I recollect our early days in college, I see myself entering senior Bhaggo's room in a state of confusion and fear of being ragged, only to find an extremely thin, almost skeletal figure, smiling nonchalantly while smoking a sutta right in front of the seniors. It had to be him; it had  to be Aniket Sharma.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Together, we were ragged on numerous occasions. I am probably the only one in our batch who completely knows the aptness of one of his nicks, 'Mast Ram'. Some of his stories were absolutely hilarious <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .<br>First semester was a time when Aniket and I became the best of friends. Since than, I have enjoyed each and every moment on offer. I completely remember all the chicken we had together, the way he convinced us(Ranjeet and I) into crossing the 'then' IIIT jungle at 2 in the night, the night before the DLD end-sem exam, and his resolution to quit smoking. There are just too many memories that I can associate with him. Hence, I will go no further in recollecting the past.<br>Aniket Sharma is one of the most careless, weirdest, and distinct characters to have lived on this planet. His level of complexity goes unparalleled. Yeah, and I mean unparalleled. If I have to rate him and Mr. Garimella Ramamurthy on the scale of complexity, I would definitely rate him a notch higher than the most loved professor in IIIT....Sorry guys <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He is among the fastest runners in college, but when it comes to walking, he can easily give a snail a run for its money. One of the most responsible guys during Felicity'07 and '08, he can be totally irresponsible when it comes to day-to-day things in life, the famous daaru kaand, for instance. His inconsistent behaviour has often led to endless bakar in our wing.</b></i></ul><br><br>
