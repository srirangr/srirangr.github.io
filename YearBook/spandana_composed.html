<b>For <a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I take the honor of writing a testimonial for my best buddy .<br><br>Well knowing her for a long period of 7 years makes me confused .. how to start off a testimonial and end it in compact . I can write a big book on her that describes how close we are an how much she means to me .<br><br>Her name .. swirls in most of the mouths .. as 'Very Hard working girl ' .. and thats how I came to know her in the beginning .. later we became clasmates , benchmates ,  roommates !! . Hmm .. well it was tough in the beginning .. I remember all the cold wars and silly fights we had about the weekend test ranks <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I loved your competitive spirit ya ! . I never thought that we would end up at a same place for Btech .<br><br>I could see lot of change in lydu after coming to IIIT .. the most caring , loving , funny , sweet , emotional (all senti and sweet kinda adjectives may not be sufficnet here to describe her as she is that adorable love u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> ). <br><br>She's the one who first comes into my mind whenever I want to share any happy or a sad thing . A rare combo of great things ! .<br><br>Easily gets angry on simple things and sometimes she's follishly stubborn on stupid things . (I was victim mant times in this case <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ).<br><br>Love you lyddu .. Im def gonna miss you spending wonderful time wid you .<br><br>All the best for your future and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
