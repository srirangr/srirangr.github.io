<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=minnakantiak.html>Ajay Kumar Minnakanti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Veedu Manchi Baaludu!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sahiti.html>Sahiti Polishetty</a></b>&nbsp;<br>She is a scholar and I mostly encounter her randomly during the day. That makes her...the only Day Scholar@IIIT-H <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Have fun.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I call him Sigmund, you know, of the Freud kind.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I really enjoyed every single minute I spent with you raa. We should meet frequently and create Raacha.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>...She gives <i>posan</i> like, she is the biggest Bewdi (Bew.D) in town but the thing is, she never has been in a circle of radius '1 feet' around any earthly brewerage. The way she (Haathi-mere-Saathi) hits people makes me wanna believe that she has got a black belt in Karate. You just don't feel bored when this rophal girlie's around, naanstaap taalking!!, paater-paater (yuck! and creepy at times when she acts like a Public Loudspeaker and tells my personal thoughts to another Public Loudspeaker called Harshita. I was refering to 70 MM) the biggest phone-chipkoo I've ever seen (you should take a break yaar. Kit-Kat break banta hai!) and she totally deserves an oscar for her acting <i> bahut naataka karti</i>, she is one bigg Drama Queen. The conversations we had were just<br>magical, we would never run out of topics to chat about. Although, I mostly talked and she listened (yes, I did check on and off for the glazed look of disinterest and boredom, and no, it wasn't there). Very Well, by any chance, if you feel bored in CIQ, no worries, Faculty Lounge/MSIT Balcony is the new Central Perk, we all can do some catching up there, yeah?<br> <br>Xx</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>...Lately, her beautiful mind started looking through those quirky specs. At one point of time <i>toh</i>, I was like "whoa! your blog should be titled as "My Life Through Gay Goggles", no offense. This <i>Chashmish</i> scares the faint-hearted with her "Shaitan ki Nani" laughter but always has this childlike charm on her face. Well, I should also say that she is a prodigal daugther who wears fancy-schmancy clothes, has voluminously curly hair and is a maha-shopaholic. Nowadays, she is feeling blue for absolutely no reasons (or of which I've no clue about). Anything could trigger it off, a dialogue, a song, a person, anything at all. Sometimes, her Telugu is so stellar I just stand amazed (ofcourse, I wanna learn it too). The biggest surprise of the century IS: how did I ever manage to SURVIVE eating the Gulab-Jumans she made. Dear Lord, that's what the food served in hell must taste like. Sometimes, you make me wanna believe in miracles re (I'm addressing to god over here). Anyways, the point is, the point is: I'm just kiddin' Deepti. No, no, really hear me out, they were pretty darn good da! I would also like to have a bit of 'bhaav' and some vada pav please (Fuck! I should really leave the rhyming thing to the "professionals").</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>From a gawky little girl wearing spectacles, all eager and dreamy-eyed, who entered the campus three summers ago to a Social Butterfly who definitely stands on a higher ground. This is the level of the seamless transition that Deepti has been through. She has become suitably indie. She has developed this great knack of either being right or <i>sounding</i> like she's right or refusing to believe she's </i>not<i> right, this sort of assertiveness is what Chaotic Minds like me appreciate a lot. As the time progressed, she also made clear that she'll Take No Shit when it comes to people she cares about which made her really special. If she wishes, she goes that extra mile to get things done. Saving-the-world types, an exceptionally brilliant person, as creative as one can get, she is the MISS I-CAN-DO-IT!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nvkartheek.html>MNV Kartheek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>MNV(Thin-King) commenting on Dev D - "Polam lo parupu vestharuu, aa film ee naa?". I was like megalolzz!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prudhvivatala.html>Prudhvi Vatala</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He has got the BALLS to say it. I know you've it in you, man. I knew it from the start. And I still firmly believe.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bavaaaaaaaaaaaa!, Baabaaai and all those related telugu terms. I swear, I'll learn Pure Telugu from you. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Love you DJ<br><br>P.S. don't you feel blue after seeing this mini version. You know me, you've my number and you can knock on my door at any time, any fuckin' time, yeah. We'll create an absolute riot.<br> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When she's around, I'll just shut up. I won't, cannot and will not be able to open my mouth. She's the Master Blaster, CounterStrike Goddess. She entered Farewell '09 like - "look who's the new chick in town, people!" (I desperately wanna use plural form of some other word instead of 'people' but I'll restrain) Woh my gaad, I shaacked. Good Luck! and btw, you raaaaaack. Saary wraang English, I say! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=charan.html>Charan Thota</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nuvu mast company raa bai!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Siva Reddy ante LTRC ammaila ki sollu. Gem raa veedu, Gem! Pure Gem. If Abhilash is a fruit on that Banyan tree, this guy is a fuckin' flower on it. All the best raa, in whatever you do.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Very down-to-earth in nature. OMFG!! you seem like one Bigg PJ Queen, Goddess infact, who is capable of making even Sashi slap himself. I bow to thee. I really like the sheepish smile that you give after torturing people around you. May you have the best in life, take care.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>She's the Powerpuff girluuuuuu!!!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is the chief representative of a community called: A Consortium for Yuktahaar-going, Loose-chaddi wearing and Forward Men. And he is my partner in crime.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>chicha, hyderabadi, ma homie, gangsta, geek, phodu!, my second fav artist (first is ragdoll, yaar but your sketches fall in a completely different and awesome league), can eat quintals of biryani, roams all over the wing wearing his mini-towel (which kinda looks like a mini-skirt), he tries to seduce people with it, 'gandhi' turns him on (weird, really weird), will remember doing some good stuff together in mathematika '08, sometimes, he groans as if a bamboo has just been pulled out of his ass, he is a Genthoo(telugu), Big Booty Bitch, it's an impossible task to picture him doing 'yoga', love the "walking style" which you imitate, enjoyed that 'gangsta rap' shit and do bring some dosas from home again before you do that "degree-lekhe-niklo" thing, that food was pretty dope man. bangalore mein aachi si, ek beautiful si, poti ko patale. mera aashirvaad tere saath hai. i've had some of the best times along with you man. take care. sorry, jaldi mein hun (T.Lines ka report is getting on my nerves) couldn't make a proper paragraph out of the above things but you know how much of deep respect i've for you and you know me. so, don't feel off <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>My message to you: PLEASE DON'T WEAR A LOW-WAIST JEANS, EVER. PEOPLE WILL GET NIGHTMARES.<br><br>good night and good fucking, mate. always bitchin' n trippin'. *gangsta style bye*</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Little rock 'n roll queen</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=raveendram.html>Raveendra M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My definition of a 'Stud' is Ravi. Whenever I see him, that famous monologue from Transpottin' plays in my mind. Grunge happens to be his personal brand of Heroin. He is a man of less words. He shares my animosity towards glam rock and glam dolls like Axl Rose. Nothing like a killer troika of some Indie, Grunge and Psychedelia, eh? Although, he also despises all those proto-typical non-conformists, pseudo-bohemian poseurs and wannabe post-modernists. He has got that 'view', that 'eye'. I've seen it. Hoping to see The Next Truoffat/your-favourite-classics-guy (I don't like to impose you see) in the future you. Very well then, I'll be looking out for you man. Big time. Big fuckin' time. Take care.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It all started with an English Class in the first semester, a beautiful young thing entered the classroom accompanied with a celestial breeze, his pupil expanded, following a sudden rush of blood. The next thing he heard was: "I'll be your English Teacher for this semester". What followed was a total blur - a hazy chain of events. Whatever she wore, she was just smokin'. She was better than Mary Jane and Heroin put together. Prateek just swayed through the mists of time. Time just flew by. Suddenly, she disappeared from his busy life. Damn!*<br><br>[CUT TO: SECOND SEMESTER]<br><br>Then followed the phenomenon of The Great Blues, Prateek started feeling blue, wearing Blue tees, watching films of the blue sorts and ultimately was introduced to STRIPPERS(+) of the blue-ish version.<br><br>a) He had a stripper on his lap for 15 min<br>b) He started wearing a tee with a message - "I've been with a stripper"<br>c) His pickup line became - "Doesn't it feel Electric, babe?"<br>d) He started using NOKIA 36-24-36<br><br>He tried the entire book of Calvin & Hobbes, infy documentaries on the LAN, GBs of Megan and finally his roomie came to the rescue, AK did something miraculous and comforted him (of which I've no freakin' clue) He recovered. Ready to take on the world. Rest is history! a well documented one I suppose. He bought the Monk's Ferrari, went for long drives, participated in street races, broke some traffic rules, made records, won peoples hearts and is presently, giving that machine a little rest, servicing it for the road ahead. Bon Voyage, my friend.     <br><br><br>+ FACT: 'Stripper' is a cutting instrument which ECE people use in their daily humdrum.<br><br>* Even now, if she calls me (I mean, hypothetically, I know it's Never Gonna Happen but still <umeed pe sari duniya kaayam hai yaar>...) in the middle of the night and says she wants to...you know. My answer would be only one thing: "I'm BORN ready!". I wear Blue Shoes for her, even today. Sigh.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;<br>arey, '09 hai re, josh mein sare 8s aa rahe toh, '08 samaj liya. fuck! never mind.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;<br>8:00 PM, 8th April '08<br><br>a[1], a[2], a[3]....'a[k]'<br><br>Spotted! AK, clean-shaved (OMG!! OMG!! OMG!!) and ready to take on some ghee-spread chappatis in NBH messu. For a moment, I was like "Dude, did some Tamil movie hero just pass by?" It was a "waw" moment, trust me.<br><br>Frankly speaking, whenever I meet AK (with his 'bhotu' on his forehead and a delightful smile) in the mornings during breakfast, it kinda brings in some tranquility into my chaotic mind. I see discipline, 'focus' and such good things in him, which are like...positively martian to me. That's why I like spending some time with him. We also attended the same "St. Patricks" for our +2 studies, where we used discuss about ZEE fuckin' MGM's late night movies sitting in the last bench. It was ulti-fun baap! and I know you're gonna rape your MS thesis and all, so I won't bother.<br><br>You raack mama<br>sharat</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deepti's staple food: Bhaav(hindi waala)<br><br>Bahut <i>bhaav</i> kaathi hai!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>How shall I describe Abhilash?<br><br>Um...okay, visualize our IIIT Tree(arey, apna Baniyaan/Jaagruti/Logo, rings a bell naa). Presently, a medium-sized fruit is growing on that tree. That, my dear, is Abhilash. Yes, you're right! He is the Jackfruit in the making (our future logo will have a small fruit on it). This fruit plays footer, comes up with interesting algorithms and is single, that means...ready to mingle, chicha! We published a C2D paper, did loads of traveling in railway bogies, participated in awesome contests, attended numerous Barcamps for 'theendi' and um..excuse me -- I'm not that good at total recall or thanksgiving, for that matter -- anyways, we did some really cool shit together, yeah. On a serious note, just promise me that you'll not rest until you've the Turing in your hand. You deserve it.<br><br>Baabai, nuvu topu raa, nuvu keka raa bai! Panta Pandichuko mama (this is ma version of Pandaga Chesuko!)<br><br>itluu<br>sharat<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Long long ago, a lad named Young Sash wrote a book called "Fattaa?!". It caused ripples, a chain of events like the falling of dominoes happened as the summers turned into springs and the winters turned into falls . Some of the randomly selected ones are:<br><br>a) When the Great Ravana narrated a fatta from sashi's book to Hanuman Ji, he got so angry, so angry that he set the beautiful city of Lanka ablaze (mataash! ante). All the residents of Lanka were like "Bhaag bedu, andi aayeee". You get the picture.<br><br>b) Ganguly happened to sunao-fy some of the fattas from the book to Greg Chapell. The next scene - Gangu out of the effin' cricket team.  <br><br>c) The day Hitler committed suicide, reds found his book lying beside the fuhrer.<br><br>d) Apna wasted dope, arey Kurtu Cobainu. Guess, why did he go for excessive intake of drugs, by the twist of fate, he happened to leaf through some of the journal entries of young sash. sad, no?<br><br>e) aaactually, whaat happened with benjamin button was, when he was a child, his nani from buttinda, punjab read him some of the lines from sashi's book. bas lag gayi, button ki! button's mind got dead-locked and all sorts of weird bull happened with him.<br><br>f) aur yaad nahi aa rahe hai re. apne bana lo yaar. toh! The ultimate answer to life, universe and everything - sashi ke fatte. <br><br>Nowadays, he is talking the British Accent -  bloke kate, kuch kuch ki baata karah eno (I even assured him a job in the Satyam Call Center, he is not stopping though, bummer!)<br><br>chalo, mere taraf se sab khariet, cya!</b></i></ul><br><br>
