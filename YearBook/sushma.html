<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Co-networks TA and a networks fodu. The way Rawat sir would speak to you showed that- He truly adores you as a student <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Luckily you were there, cos Harshita, Kabeer, Kharkwal and I did not know an iota about networks <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Thanks for taking up all the tough questions!<br><br>Btw, hearty congratulations <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hope you make it big in Ameeedika! <br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>the first interaction with her is during the placements. Until then I know her but she never talked to me. I guess everyone is so afraid of me <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. We talked for the first time and then have hais and byes whenever we see each other<br><br>but recently I came to know more about her. It is hard to talk with her. She can counter you and you will not have words. Found to know that she is a kasi too. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>She recently got call letters from many universities UFL, UT A&M. I think every university is fighting for her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Will contact you in the future for a reco. Don't escape <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. You know I am a devotee of Ram whom you like the most. So I think this is enough to give the reco. <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She talks very friendly which is a nice thing.<br><br>All the best. UFL is lucky <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Bye <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She is a sweet girl ,extremely hard working and focused...got calls from a lot of university <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the Best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Make the most of ur life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sushu... the chatter box <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> When it comes to explaining any situation or any incident that has already occurred, no one can do it better than her <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I bet you can't miss a bit of the story when Sushu is the narrator <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>She thinks completely differently... Her presumptions are of the kind that none of us even presume to be the consequence of some situation. I first wondered how she could think that way but had to agree when she said her mother reacts the same way she does!!! She is very studious... to that degree that she completes studying the subject taught in the class that day itself <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> I still remember how she and Ramya did their BTP in turns, one from 9 P.M to 3 A.M and the other from 3 A.M to 10 A.M. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <br><br>Congratulations for getting admits from your dream Universities =d< <br><br>She is the favorite student of Prof. Rawat <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Whatever the problem with the Networks course might be, she is the one whom Rawat calls first to solve it or help him with it <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Why don't you ask him if he knows somebody at TAMU and will help you in getting a TAship or RAship Sushu?? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I just saw the US Map yesterday. New York and Texas are quite far from each other Sushu <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I wish you all the very best for your future endeavours... We will anyway stay in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=samantapudi.html>S.Rama Krishna Raju</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She is the one who taught me gdb in the first sem and debugged some of my C programs. <br>She has lot of patience, and very kind enough to explain me LP even 2 to 3 times. I know a thanks is just not sufficient. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I wish u a very bright and wonderful future!!!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vvchaitanya.html>V.V.Chaitanya Krishna</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Being my family frnd ,I know this gal even before coming 2 IIIT. But I realized more of her nature in my very first semester <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She's one of those few persons whom I've seen wid xtreme competitive spirit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> A very sensitive and frndly gal whom neone wud lik 2 b as a frnd. I always wonder abt the levels of patience she shows wen it comes to things lik assignment, coding etc. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  A typical xample is the way she and ramya made my laziness vanish and keep me working for SE case study <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> 	<br>I can never forget those old days of 1st sem wen her gud grades wer known in her house and i had to luk 4 sum justifiable reasons to avoid saying my ugly grades in my home <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But tht was gud 4 me...atleast tht way, I had 2 study well the next sem <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> There wer times wen i unknowingly hurt her <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> My sincere apologies 4 tht...but the way she forgets them is truly inspirational <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>And now...the other side of her...the way she maintains her lappy is aaaarrrrgggghhhh! soo shabby! (dunno how is it now....but initially wen i saw it...was devastating!<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) I guess its the innate characterstic of being studious tht drives her 2 b dis way <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Nowadays, she's not even listening 2 classes (Perhaps, I'm the inspiration 4 it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>All said, she's 1 of those wonderful persons who can be trusted and is always der wenever needed <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>I hope u hav a very bright,deserving future and get MS 4m ur dream place <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sush <br>always gave me a push<br>in the exam rush!!<br><br>I remember my first yr when we both used to discuss lot of concepts just before going to write the exam. Be it coding or whatever, she used to explain anything with loads of patience and even if u ask her to repeat more number of times, she has that patience. Thanks a lot dear <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Very very dedicated and she never give up!! Has a lot of interest to go around the globe. Takes no pain in going home almost every weekend. <br><br>If she trusts someone, she never makes them to go down! <br><br>Worked with Ramya(she stays next to my room), I can easily figure out if Sush is there in Ramya's room. The way they discuss man!! <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> Even sometimes during deadlines, the discussion keeps on going till morning. Works very very hard.<br><br>I go upset with Sush, the way how she eats. Doesn't eat anything except fruits. Doesn't take breakfast and dinner properly <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br>The most upsetting part(but Sush don't hate me bcz of this and feel bad ok? ) Whenever she is upset or angry, she takes revenge by not eating food. Never understand why u do like this. Suddenly she throws the food in her plate and walk off.<br>You shud change girly in this sense!!<br><br>But very very caring and sometimes childish too. Had a gud time with you Sush. US lo kummei!!! Go girly!!<br><br>Luv u <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[contd]<br>  Yeah nd how can i forget .. shez got dis awsum memory in which she can recollect the color of dress given the date nd the license number of a vehicle <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ..

<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hmm .. If u wud hav asked me one year bak whthr i wud b writin testi 4 ane girl in IIIT ma answer wud hav been an outright "No" .. But destiny had different ideas.. So consider urself lucky.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>     My first encounter wid dis gal was wen v were ES tutors under Biswas nd i had to teach her some stupid software nd judging by da look on her face i thought evrythin i was sayin went well over her head <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. but i knew how wrong i was in da internship whr she showed aawsum talent nd hardworks but only to ma annoyance cos our stupid project manager wud compare her work wid mine .. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Now logically speakin how v bcame gud friends is bcoz of these long chats during walks from CMC bak to coll (bliv me .. wen u walk wid her it seems to b a relly big walk cuz of her aawsum pace ) nd during the lunch times at CMC (da only1 who can eat longer dan me ) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. She patiently listens to all da stupid crap i speak nd tries to give valuable advices <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.. she attempted to teach me da greatness of punctuality nd hard work during intern but it remained in da state of attempt itself (but srsly .. i tried).. the first gal i dared to ask for coffee may it b @ CMC canteen .. i srsly appreciate the strength she showed wen 'thr were stories of both of us appearin at tank bund' woven in air by some arbit guy nd i was worried if she'd burst into tears ( cos i dont knw how to ) <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .. But to my surprise she responded with courage to the statements nd later we wud make fun of these stories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. Can nvr forget the placement party shez given to me cuz was one of da reasons ma shyness began to wither ..<br>      <br>               Now to the step of describin her which i think has been done justice in her previous testimonials.. But still i repeat nd confirm dat she is sincere in watever she does, hard working , balanced ,sensitive nd not but not da least fun-lovin ( obvi cuz u hang out wid me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) .. Does justice to her acads nd sumtyms to my acads too .. remember crypto assigns ? .. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>     If you are in our wing and you listen to this sexy saxaphone music suddenly out of nowhere, well, you are at Sushma's and thats her ringtone <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Funny thing, she hates her mobile so much for no reason  <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>What can I say about Sush..<br><br>A girl so sensitive that you cannot but pray that she never gets hurt, a girl so caring that you cannot but wish to repay it back, a girl so hardworking, that you cannot but wish her the best in her life and the girl so humble, that you cannot but wish to do something to cheer her up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>     Its because of her <i>keka</i> knowledge in Physics that I managed to pass in that subject in first year <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . We always eat off all the stuff her mom packs for her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . She loves staying at home soo much that you hardly spot her in campus during weekends..Well, you do spot her walking in the night <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif />  <br>       We became so close especially in the third year, we you used sit either in her room or mine and used to go on and on till 4-5 in the morning.. We both being in CVIT, worked together on a couple of projects, and boy, she is so dedicated and good at her work, it really inspires you to work better..<br>      We go on and on talking about the crappiest telugu movies and their titles, not to forget few one liners and songs from the same..She has seen more than her share of telugu movies and does a lot of <i> gyaan baantna</i> on how crappy few of them are... Remember the time when in yuktahaar, you,me,kd and anu sang songs and remembered stupidest dialogues and laughed so hard that we stole the show and brought some life to the soporific, sombre yukhtahaar? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Its fun when we are all together and absolutely boring if even one of us is missing <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>  Finally, Many many congratulations for getting into some of the finest universities and hope you finish off your MS in 1 year and come off and we all stay together.. always.. Love you and will miss you a lot <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sushma or 'Susu' as she has been fondly re-named <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> is one of the most caring and genuine people I know. Hardworking,organized and sincere, she is a friend who will give you sound advice and stand by you as long as you are honest. Getting a tad bit too philosophical for my taste... shifting gears<br><br>Susu can be a riot sometimes. She is great company and I will never forget that day in yucktahaar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> mess during placements when we laughed for 30 mins at a stretch. She is a romantic at heart coz the music she hears all day long are these slow numbers that have become a trademark in our wing <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. A fellow f.r.i.e.n.d.s fanatic who remembers every single episode and dialogue!<br>   I will always look back on our conversations about life,family and other such casual topics <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> with a huge smile on my face. We have had countless bc sessions in our wing and in classes over games like tollywood (she knows the most crappiest telugu movie names <img src=Smileys/10.gif />),bingo and nmpt! Not to forget certain other games as well <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Studies have always been her priority but of late walking seems to have become her passion <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. But she is one of the most level headed,understanding and mature girls of our batch and I know she will manage things !!!<br><br>Congratulations on getting into some really good institutes for MS and wishing all the luck in your future. Stay the same and people will appreciate you for the wonderful friend and person you are. I will miss you and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sushma...she is hardly called by this name. She has the most number of nick names and the greatest number of paradies written on each of her nick names. She's the Mother India of her batch <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Most of us go to her in trouble times and she is always ready with a helping hand. She is our "go-to" girl. I don't know how but people who don't know her really well also melt down in her magic. Important point to note is that her mood swings like a pendulum <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Give her 4 secs...In the 1st sec she is a kewl gal, in the 2nd sec she is all moody and gets philosophical, in the 3rd sec she loses her temper and in the 4th sec she is a very cute and innocent girl who wants to be petted by everyone <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Yeah yeah...it an exaggeration, of course <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She is amazingly dedicated to work. Whatever you do she is not going to get down from her work unless and until it is done and that too in the best manner possible. She goes out of her way to help someone in their acads...from self-experience <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is a bermuda triangle in terms of pens...give her one and you can never get it back <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I've known this girl for the past 5 1/2 years and she owes quite a number of stationery things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> As anu calls her...she is like a radio. When she starts off talking there is no stopping her. She can go on and on for hours together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Oh yeah...she has a great talent as a lyricist. When she doesn't remember the lyrics of a song she fills in some random word in that place and the best part is that it blends so well with the song that you cannot, sometimes, even notice the difference. She is my oldest friend in IIIT and the friend I respect the most. I am extremely sorry for hurting you sussu <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I really regret it and i will treasure our friendship forever. You will always hold a special page in my life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Some scholar said:- 'Wherever you are, it is your friends who make your world'. I seriously heed to this because ever since I met this girl, she has become my world. Three long years have passed away and we don't even remember what it must have been that got us so close. Alter-ego is the best title I can give her, for she acts the same as I do. She has a real tender heart and a pretty smile that is very precious for we-friends. We proudly share the memories of late-night-movies in workspace, sleep-early movies in my room, pizza huts and chutneys, Combined studies for the exams and assignments, personal evaluations in AI, spree for shopping and baskins-icecreams, DSNR bustop and our very old 217-D. With all these in mind and tears filled in eyes,We are heading for a new era hoping to keep in touch in every second that is ahead. Its really hard for me to put in words the love I have for you. I can only promise you my friendship for life-time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>here goes a testimonial to my dearest frnd sushma aka sussu...hmmm i was not very close to her when i was in my first year. Then we happened to shift our rooms and she took the room opposite to mine. We used to have long chats which used to go on for hours and hours on every other topic be it gals , guyz, family ,outfits accessories etc etc...and  she is a big chatter box..doesnt seem like one though <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. she has been wid me thru all the ups and downs of my life.She goes home every other day and her mom cooks really really well..she gets all home made stuff and i munch away almost the whole of it . I have been to her place a lot of times ...and it was just like meeting my parents.very very very sensitive and stubborn <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . she is very hardworking and serious about her studies...got placed in an awesome company, got a terrific gre  score(1420) and has already got an admit from the arizona state university <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> nd is all set to pursue here masters abroad...lastly all i wanna say is that i ll  miss her very very badly and i m sure that we will be frnds through out our life ....all the best sweety <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...luv ya lots <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
