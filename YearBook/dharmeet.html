<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>oh I forgot about Samvedana... dude you're doing great work out there... keep up the good work!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first thing I learnt about him is that he lived in Indore and that he slept early and prayed everyday. Once I attended satsang on occasion of some festival of Sikhs and there he was, singing or speaking (whatever its called) the sabad or bhajans (i hope that's what its' called) and he was doing it real good!<br>I still remember the day when in 1st semester we met one day and he asked me about how my exams had been. I said I was afraid that I'll fail in few courses, but he said, "arre satti toh sabki aa jaayegi, tension mat le." and he was right that I shouldn't worry, but I didn't make it to 7, got 6.91... lol !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I like that cool attitude of his...!!<br>He was one of the first person I'd met in IIIT. He gave me his hard disk's casing to help me figure out problem in my laptop's hard disk! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

He really is a source of inspiration for life.<br><br>His recent efforts wid Samvedana have left me wonderstruck. He has such a passion to help others. He tirelessly thinks about how we can make d lives of others better. He would keep on coming to me suggesting small things...we can do X..we can do Y...why not do dis also... Then he would keep on changing partners to visit some NGO..but he himself would always b thr...I could keep on adding to dis but I know he doesn't like to b talked abt like dis...so I stop it here....<br><br>Quick facts:<br><br>His heart is soft as  velvet....Has a BIG heart too. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Shares his happinesses, his worries <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>d first one to look after me whn i'm sick <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>dil pe bahut jaldi le lete hain...as a careless person my actions often hurt him <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Gussa jaldi kar lete hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Enjoys doing BC about me with Ankush. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Discloses all my secrets to Ankush and Vigla <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> mere ghar walon ke aage bhi mere bhed khol deta hai yaar <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br><br>Is afraid of only one person...Ranjeet Singh <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Will kill me if he gets a chance....i'm afraid of him <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He's looking to do a PHD...hope u don't end up in IIIT wid ur kids <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Finally I'm very much hopeful tht he gets posted in Hyd.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the most religious guys I've ever seen, Dharmeet is a one of his kind person. He was religious in his first year, and that kept increasing as the time worn by. These days, especially from his questions in the Indic classes, you can see that he tried a lot to understand what Indian religion has got to teach to us, and is trying to see in the context of his life. I'm sure some of the amazing calm he has is courtesy The Guru Granth Sahib <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>He has some very good habits, early to bed and very early to rise; good food habits; good mannerisms.. All of these are worth emulating. He is interesting company, but cracks way too many fattas, and starts laughing- something which forces you to laugh, but silently curse him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .His fridge was very famous in cellar for having a never ending supply of stuff <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>All the best in life!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Him teaching Indic, thanks for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Babaji aka Dharmeet Paaji is one of the most religious guy I have ever met. He stayed in cellar in the first two years. He used to wake up early in the morning and do regular prayers daily. There has been some times when it was the time for me to sleep and he was busy doing his daily chores. He was the one who had a refrigerator and was a supplier of milk to many people.<br><br>His jokes are somewhat out of this world. It actually needs some time to understand them. I usually interacted with him during meals in yuktahaar. He is very soft spoken. Usually its really hard to listen to him because he speaks so softly.<br><br>One advice for him would be to come out of his closet and enjoy the life because this is the time of our lives and it will never come back.<br><br>God bless you. Good luck for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Babaji is one guy who </b>I can see how the college has transformed in a positive way.<br><br>Ever since our ragging days, as I saw the seniors simply letting go of him as soon as he would utter the D word, I had thought of him as a person who had remained underexposed all his life because of the problem, and as a result had suffered in his overall personality development. I saw him living a simple, disciplined, peaceful, austere life with no tensions either about studies or about any other college activities, and I began to see him as a counter example for devotion. That God provides a little too much to man, which makes his life a bit too simple than it should be, thereby lessening the amount of skills he could have learnt otherwise. <br><br>We all make mistakes, this was one such, and I'm writing it here as I know he will understand. Things came a full circle, with the entire batch going berserk about placements, and this dude remaining cool as a cucumber, getting screwed up in writtens, possessing no special technical skill, but still always sure that with whatever knowledge he had, things will fall into place. <br><br>Placements, among other things taught me the relative importance of a few things in life.<br><br><b>Final semester </b>suddenly saw him getting transformed into a powerhouse. All the energies he had been saving up all these years are now finding an outlet through Samvedana and SOCH, of both he is a backbone. The good relations maintained within his community of what I think is a group of delightful people following a totally ideal philosophy are standing Samvedana in good stead. I see him working his ass off now, when people are enjoying their retirements, and I feel more proud of my batch than ever. I see him learning new skills, his confidence getting visible, his popularity among the fairer sex growing, and I realize that all that was to be conquered was one's self. Rest every victory is but a manifestation of that.<br><br>Chalo pa'aji, I hope I have it in me ki future mein apan is kaam ke through jude reh s</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dharmeet Singh or Babaji is one of few who is far more mature than his age. A very religious person, and follows everything. Always used to visit holy places. Good thing about that is he always brings lot of Sweets while coming back and he personally come to my room for giving that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is an active volunteer of Samvedna, always tries to help with something <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His fridge is like a gift for us cellarites, always keep something to eat <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- All those sweets, All those mails<br>Most Memorable moments : - Your b'dy treat<br>Msg for U: - Try taking things light and keep sending sweets to B'lore <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>@Dharmeet : its not abt defining friends ... its abt ur views ... nothing is being tested here ... infact it feels gr8 that atleast u think abt other people ... everyone's time is very important and if u can devote 10-15 mins writing abt him then I think u can spend a lot of time with him without even giving another thought <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Take the things lightly and have fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dharmeet aka baba ... thats what we call him. He is one of those persons from whom I get the inspiration to help others. He is the most religious and devoted person I had ever seen in my life <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is an active member of the 'Samvedana' and is the person to take initiatives and is doing the thing with full spirits. <br><br>In my Life I have seen many people who are suffering from some problem and always mentioning that thing and always think of that thing as the hindrance in the progress of their life .. but he is the person who always take the things in a positive ways and living his life the way he wants to ... never seen him demotivated because if his problem <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Another thing that inspires me to enjoy my life <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is my Yuktahar partner and after having dinner we use to go for a walk ... we use to talk about hell lot of things starting from college life to social problems to each and every issue that we face in our daily life ... <br><br>He a complete chatter box ... once he starts then he never ends talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... I think thats the reason he impresses a lot of girls in and out of our campus <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. If you want any girls phone number then you can contact baba <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... I tried to learn the ways he uses to impress girls but I am really bad at that <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. We always tease him for one or the other girl <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Other than me .. he is the person who travels alot .. you can't make him stay in the college for more than a week. Every month he plans a trip either to Bidar or Nanded or Sagar or Indore .. and even before coming back, the plan for the next trip is always ready <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is very honest, trustworthy and really good at heart ... if want any help he will always be ready for that (but not in studies ... bhut light hai us maamle mein <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>I would always like to see you the way you are ... we are in the same company so i hope the things will be great there and we will have alot of fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
