<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>      Akash is one of those studs of EC, something which never got into my head.The first time I spoke to him was we having such a bad fate to get the <b>deadliest</b> panel anybody can ever think of - pjn, jayanthi and Kamal. We used to share our woes, <i> ek doosre ki kitni watt lagti hai advisor ke haaton mein</i>, etc.<br> <br>      Then we worked in Philips together and thats when I got to know more about him. Me being, hmm.. a moderate talker <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, I used to narrate such stories every day about such arbit stuff. It was like during lunch, he used to say, <i>aur kya chal raha hai tere roomie ke saath? </i> and bang, I kept going on and on, jumping from one topic to the other, going on and on and on.. But I even gave you chance to talk <i>beech beech mein </i>, dint I? I used to tease him with literally every freaking lady who passed our way during our lunch, we used to make fun of our project manager etc etc.<br><br>     I wish you truck loads of good luck. Stay in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I used to talk to him in first year...workspace rocks <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ....The most fond memory of him is he used bring pade from his home town and they were delicious...simply awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Last three years we have had casual greetings only ...<br><br>All the best ..wishing you lots of luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Phodu banda hai. ECE ka hoke has phodu coding skills. Used to debug my C codes in 1st semester. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I wonder why he didn't convert to CSE.<br>He's totally cool and confident about things. He uses logic really well.<br>He likes to have fun, I still remember during our batch trip while traveling from Hyd to Vizag, among others he was singing songs but I could feel that passion, that pleasure in his voice.<br>Seriously an awesome guy!<br>What I would like to take from him is his cool confident attitude...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I can never forget my days of GRE. I used to be very tense at that period due to too much of workload. I had my GRE in October and when the college starts in August, he came back from Bangalore completing his intern. He used to come to my room innocently search for Barrons and used to ask words non stop. The only respite I had that he had given me the exemptions of selecting word lists I want to give tests from <img src=Smileys/13.gif />!!!<br>Really his support in those days was commendable. I had my center in Bangalore, he asked me if he should go with me and I said that it would be comforting for me if he could go. We went there(in sleeper, although he had a pass but I did not want to spent money on AC). Those were the tough times and I will never forget what you did for me in those days. <br>All the best.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Aakash,</b> one of the ever-working ECE people in our batch.<br><br>We lived on the same floor in GHEB in the first year, and my very first few outings were with this group. How different those days were! He had known some programming since before, as far as I remember, but by any standards, he was a very sharp coder. I was sure that he will change his branch to CSE. That never happened but still during placements, he started acing all the CS companies' written exams right from day 2 <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I'm happy for you that you have a nice job in a CS-related company now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I knew him better only in the 4th year, during the Hindi course, when we used to disagree with Laltu sir's ideology. Since then, we're eating in Yuktahaar together almost everyday. His resilience was on ample display during the placement season, when company after CSE company rejected him, apparently for being an ECE guy, when his strengths lay at CSE. That must have been one trying period, and could have been unnerving for anyone. Kudos to you for navigating through it so beautifully <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>A gentleman, hard-working and sincere, that's how I know him. Cheers to you and have a great life.<br><br><b>Memories:</b> The awesome grading criteria in the Hindi Course in which we both got B-</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I always get a grin on my face when I hear his name (its called the DCH effect). Roll number 200530001 (#1), Btech ECE. Looks very very (... very ->infinity) innocent, but mind you looks are deceptive <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He is a total food freak. He is a total phodu saala when it comes to Coding. I wish he was in CSE, I am sure you would have reached heights easily. Any Felicity event which has Puzzles in it, Akash's name will always be found in the winners list. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is too good at solving them - probably he should write a book on puzzles after having solved so many. Has kept us entertaining with the you-know-what he downloads. He gets lots of food stuff when he comes from home (I love Mathura ke peda). He is our group ka event manager. He plans the trip so well that he leaves no room for error. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>One person who has been very proactive during the placements. Thanks for those tutorial sessions that you had conducted. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>I haven't interacted much with Aakash, but of whatever little, it has been very cordial. In fact, hes that time of a guy- never gets agitated and is quite friendly. My first memories with him date back to the time when we were being ragged by the D-gang. In misery, we stuck it out <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . After that, I remember discussing Jaws' assignments in the workspace, and most of the times, he had an elegant solution ready for the problem in question. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> His competency came to fore recently, during placements. We got interviewed for a lot of companies together, including Adobe, Citrix, Ivy. I was very happy when he finally got placed <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I also remember doing Jeevan Vidya together. Kapil, he and I interacted a lot back then - it was a bit of a relief from some of those sessions. Overall, hes a guy with friendly demeanour and a positive outlook.<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b> Fav memory: Jeevan Viday </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My classroom neighbour in the first year, Akash is one of the most composed and descent guyz around. During class and assignment sessions, his coding skills always amazed me. I always wondered, how can someone with his skills got into EC and not into Comp Sci. I pity you for that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He was always among those who used to finish the C assignments before time. His workspace system was among the best configured and I often used his to watch movies. We shared some nice time during the classes and I had a great time being his neighbour. After 1st year things changed and our interaction level went down but this never let me feel different about him.<br><br>I still look at him as one those persons whom I will remember for a long time be it for his coding skills, his friendly and helping nature, cheerful attitude, sincerity and dedication.<br><br>Good luck mate. May you reach great heights. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Akash aka aks ... hamare gang ka one of the cool banda. Bhai ismein jo puzzeles solve karne ka talent hai, mujhe aaj tak kisi mein nahi dikha <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . C DS ka bond hai, placements mein isne aur maine bahut saare written nikale hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, but convert nahi kar paye <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> . Bhaisaab ko party dene mein koi hitchkichahat nahi hoti, jab bhi iski terat hoti hai, mein to khush ho jata hu, "yaar aaj to jam ke khaunga since akash poora finance karega" <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Banda bolta thoda kam hai, jab bhi kisi ki fight ho rahi hoti hai, ye waha pe chup hi baithta hai, isne kabhi kuch nahi kahan ase mauke mein. Train mein kabhi 2nd class se niche nahi gaya ... Hamare batch ka Downloader bhi raha hai kabhi <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Second year mein khuub CS khela hai humne iske room pe .. will miss those days ...

<b><a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br> Ye Aks and akash ke naame se jaane jaate hain..<br>Electronics items se inhe wishesh prem hain lekin jab inke electronic items ghoomne jaate hain <br>to unka sansaar se moh toot jaata hain <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif />.<br>He is intelligent guy with strong logics <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.C mein to bhai bond hain banda. I year mein C mein <br>isne naa jaane isne kitne logo ki programming karwai hain <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Sudoku bagerah isi ne sikhaya hain mujhe. He is my cache-in partner or briefly online events partner.<br> Ye one of the downloaders hai. 2 Pc workspace mein downloading par laga dete the, kuch esagu lab <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> mein baaki room se dwnload karte rehte the. I year mein inke PC mein 20 GB HD thi baaki PC's mein 4 Gb thi, to yahin sab dwnload karke sharing karte the, sabke paalan karta the <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br>Ye live games (TT,cricket,badminton,carrom,kabaddi etc.) kam  khelte hain but saare time online games. Jab CZ khelte hain to generally inki count sabse jyaada hoti hai. Inhe computer mein naye-2 software download karne mein bada mazaa ata hain, Koi bhi naya ya purana software bagerah ki advice chaie ho to just aks ke room tak jao aur mil jaaegi. <br>Generally discussion se door rehna pasand karte hai. Inhe photo kheechne ka bada shauk lekin apni aur surrundings ki <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif />.<br>Placement season mein to inke jeevan mein ek bandi aayi thi lekin hume bhabhi pasand nahi aai to <br>bas inhone bhi reject kar di <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif />.<br>Yobuddy ki most of the trip ke planner yahin hote hain aur ye mast shaanti se organize karta hain <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>Ab to sonus networks jaa rahe hain.

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This guy is a sort of irony, he is arguably one of the best coders around, was definitely one of the best on our first year. He cleared the written tests of CS companies which most of us werent able to make sense of and Yet the irony is that he is in EC. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Definitely one of the sharpest brains around. Havent interacted much with him but whatever interaction I have had with him, he comes up as poised, a little sly smile on his face and the confidence to take on the world.<br><br>Here's hoping for a great future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Akash, known him because of all the d/l he did for the IIIT community <img src=Smileys/3.gif />Is a big fan of comics, I used to listen him and Ojasvi talking about all those PDFs he d/led and how there story are, I was so interested by that I end up reading few comics myself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I still have few of them in my HDD.<br> During placement,I got to know how much talented he is. Though from ECE background ,he gave tough competition for everyone in CSE, pta nahin kitne saare written nikale the bande ne <img src=Smileys/1.gif />^<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and finally got into "SONUS" <img src=Smileys/41.gif />=>d <br>Final sem mein to LP ka jimma jaise issi le rakha hain, he teaches us during exam, does the assignment and proxy our attendance in class <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />.Great work dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>As you are placed in B'lore keep in touch.Wish you all the best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- D/ling Things <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Most Memorable moments : - Cricket in Felicity Ground <br>Msg for U: - Every weekend party in Bangalore <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yeh hamare college ke un chand logon mein se hain, jinka comics padhne ka shauk abhi tak barkaraar hai. Comics ki collection karna isne thode time pahle shuru kiya hai, lekin itni comics collect kar chuka hai ki comics ki ek digital library khol le <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>Padhai ke case mein yeh bhai sahab mera 'no tension' wala rule follow karte hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Last time tak ekdum cool rahega, aur phir kuchh hi ghanton mein padh kar number bhi mast le aata hai. Coding ka itna bada bond hai ki first year mein yeh na hota to aadhe log C, DS ki assignments ke time par apne baal noch-noch kar ganje ho chuke hote <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Aur computer aur softwares ke baare mein itni knowledge hai ki CSE wale bhi aakar doubts poochhte hain is se. Computer par koi kaam karna ho to Akash ke paas uske liye koi na koi software mil hi jaata hai.<br><br>Vaise to movies kam dekhta hai lekin X-Men ab tak kam se kam 50 baar to dekh hi chuka hoga. Aur agar ise koi nayi movie dekhni ho to Richeek ko bhi woh movie dekhni hi padti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Kaafi shaant type ka banda hai, aaj tak college mein isne kisi se ladai nahin ki hai. Haan kabhi kabhi agar gussa aata hai to chilla deta hai achanak se but that is it. Uske baad phir se normal ho jaata hai (most of the times <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).<br><br>Aur photography se ise vishesh prem hai. Agar camera iske haath mein ho to kahin par bhi pics lena shuru kar deta hai. Aur ise sabse zyada shauk hai apni pics khinchwane ka, agar koi na mile to apni pics khud hi leta rahta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Iski display pic bhi isne khud hi click ki huyi hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Lekin bande mein talent to hai, pics achchhi leta hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>Aur bahut si baatein hain, lekin baaki ke dost log woh already bata chuke hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>All the best for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sagrawal.html>Shashank Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Wah agrawal ji...wah...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is a perfectionist. Jis cheez mein man lage jaye, ekdum perfection tak karta hai. Bande ke saare item selected hote hain. Room hamesha chaka-chak, har cheez sahi jagah par. Inhe richeek bahut pasand hai. Dono room-mates ki ultimate bonding hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  Hamesha riceek ki utarta rehta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I came to know him the day our first C assignment was given. I wanted to complete it on the first day itself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> but I wasn't sure about the last question. I felt no-one would have done all the questions. However, during dinner someone told me that th<br>ere is one guy who has done all. I was really surprised and wanted to meet him urgently. Our first meeting was on this day an<br>d I was immediately impressed <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> As time passed, more assignments came. We used to discuss a lot of questions. He is perhaps<br>the first person in IIIT I became fan of.<br><br>He is very sharp, can solve questions in few minutes on which you would bang your head for hours. Has a knack for solving puz<br>zles, sudoku, and other interesting stuff - faster than you could imagine <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Also, has a great sense of humor and excellent timing. He likes trying out new things - new food items, new places. Is advent<br>urous and open to new ideas <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

The one thing I like very much abt him is that he volunteers  every time for arranging parties like getting cakes, drinks etc. Aur party ka hisab bhi yahi dekhte hain.<img src=Smileys/1.gif />  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met this guy on my very first day at IIIT-H. I guess he did not understand my name the first time[<img src=Smileys/14.gif />]. We were from neighboring places so we decided to share the room. First year was tough for me and cool for him. In those tough days of coding he was the only guy in the lab who used to debug my codes [<img src=Smileys/77.gif />]. Although he was more generous to Adi  but that is a different story. <br><br>He really loves to read [<img src=Smileys/4.gif />]. His daily average was 5 pages per day during the days of first year. Reading work as sedative for him.<br>Though now i guess it has improved quite a bit. But the book is still the same "Harry Potter". <br><br>He is lazy but whatever he does marks his perfection. He is not from CSE but knows coding better than most of those guys. Loves to tweak with electronics gadgets, laptop, mobile anything that has a chip inside. He can solve any problem if it is related to your laptop or coding. <br>"Akash yar PDF main kaise convert karoon isse." Akash bolta hai ,"abe ye converter le le mere paas pada hai, chinese main kuch aata rahega click karta rahio. Install ho jayega <img src=Smileys/1.gif />".<br><br>"Abe mujhe ye algorithm implement karni hai, do din se mara raha hoon, kaise karon?". Bhai bole, "Abe ek for loop laga, iske andar ek while<br>phir ek if condition, andar ek for then finally case lagakar break kar de!!!!". "Thanks akash, code hi de de <img src=Smileys/4.gif />"<br><br>What I think he does not know his strengths. His logic is remarkable. He is too good in solving puzzles, too good in algorithms. Wherever he goes he will succeed.<br>Buddy, we will always be best friends.<br> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Well this guy shd be idolized by both ECE and CSE guys.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> We used to live in the same hostel during the first two years. Though he specializes in electronix  he was the most "Wanted Guy" during the C assignment submissions in the lab. We could hear "Akash-Akash" from all the corners of the lab as soon as he entered the lab. He used to help all the students even though he still had to submit his own questions. His knowledge in C impressed me a lot as he used to solve our doubts in seconds while we used to ponder over it for hours.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I came to know him better during the Jeevan Vidya sessions.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We were both Made to sit together and we both were equally excited abt the idea of Jeevan Vidya. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> While for most of our batch mates JV was a torture, it turned out pretty gud for me mostly because of this guy. We used to talk a lot during the sessions, and tried to argue with Bagadia sir without any reason. I still remember the long breaks we used to take and competition of who will bring more biscuits during those breaks. Well neither of us cud win as Mathur would beat us all.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> After Jv our BC sessions used to continue all the time, in classes ( we had very less no. of classes together we were in different sections <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) outside GHEB on the stairs or in his room. The best part of being with this guy is that we don't have to try, your time will pass like anything. <br>Our interests also matches a lot, like both of us like movies and some other videos too which he used to dwn from net ( I hope you get it buddy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) . Special thanx for those videos <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Both of us have a special craving for old songs. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Some things/moments I will always cherish abt you: Your way of doing Hisaab, Mathura ki sweets, our walks after exams ( as usually both of us did badly we were mostly complaining abt the questions ), our 5 mins study sessions before exams in which we used to revise the complete course <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, our nfs underground competitions which I used to win all the time <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, your lab pc which I used all the time <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Keep Rocking Dude </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Akash is person who has perfect timing of doing things. Will be silent most of the time and only speak when the effect of it would be optimum. <br>Very intelligent though uses his skill very occasionally. <br>I fanatic for comics and games. I was literally shocked to see the list of comics which he had read (he maintains a XL sheet of the comics he has). A very good friend and a good cook too. Knows a lot when it comes to kitchen. Good for his future partner. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  </b></i></ul><br><br>
