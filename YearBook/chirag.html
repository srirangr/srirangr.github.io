<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Chirag aka Chika</u><br><br>Back in first year, I knew him as the roomie of Pagare, he wasnt one of those guys who would go and interact with a lot of people. He has always been the silent assasin types, you gotta admire him for his leofying skills, bas beech mein 1 line bolega banda and usse doosre bande ki gandi mar jati hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> One of the wittiest people around. He is one person everybody's scared of <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He is one person who hasnt changed a bit since coming to IIIT, his life has been so constant these years that at times I feel if he doesnt get bored by this monotonicity. But I guess he's like that only!! One thing about him is that he doesnt open up, I dunno what it is with him that he has rarely opened up :| This has been a hot topic of discussion many times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> though no one has been able to come out with a theory as to why it is so <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>A fellow cricket enthusiast, He, Pappu, Maroo and me form the core group <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> we hav had so much fun watching all those cricket matches and discussing about them. All those evenings we spent in the swimming pool discussing cricket and forgetting all about swimming <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Those were awesome times. <br><br>The night at club 8 jab humne sare waiters ki mother sister united kar di thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> It was so much fun that way, one of my best drinking memories <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Writing this testimonial feeling so sad that You got your joining in Pune instead of Hyd, it would have been hell lot fun with you being here <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best with just a hope that you would be more extrovert from now on. Life's too small to bottle up things!!<br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..<br><br>PS: Wishlist to awesome rakhi hai be <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Chiku!!<br><br>To start with, me and Himank came up with an award for him that was "Castrol award for consistent performance". He hasn't changed<br>a bit from the first year. He has religiously followed his schedule. He is very sincere, be it academics, CAT preparation or basketball. I owe my<br>most hilarious incident in IIIT to him, it happened way back in the end of the second year in NBH, when I was leofied by the group, I got<br>irritated and started hitting people.The next thing I remember,Chika agressively sprungs up wearing a helmet, the expression he had cannot be<br>expressed in words. Chika is known for his awesome onliners. He also cracks PJs but he tells it secretly to Mota <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He doesn't like when someone pulls his leg, the next reaction comes is "tu to rahene hi de...". I remember our first Dumb C competition and he was not able to guess a movie <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and the fight we had after that<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Chika doesn't really opens up, I remember pestering him "Bhai chike tu aaj aape bare mein kuch bata" and he would get irritated. Whenever he used to go home I used to say "ki isbaar kuch kaand karke aana". He wanted to be a hero but landed in IIIT, his body language is worth noticing, sometimes he keeps on styling his hairs, flexes his muscles when know one is noticing, starts boxing in the air. This motherfucker leofied me a lot in first year. He and Pagare would never get bored pulling my leg. Interestingly we could never come up with any good nick for him, tough we tried, the whole "tubelight thing", "Po** Star" but nothing really worked. He was my BTP partner, I wanted him to do the whole BTP but saale ne kaat diya. He gets into a very different "SuperHero" mode when he is drunk.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The Part Twos<br><br>Aah! I will remember the RDB thing, dragging you to your room after the booze party of Felicity'08,<br>Bhai's Holi kaand and the story they cooked up after that, recent Club 8 visit and the question he asked me, BTP ka kaam, cursing our BTP guide, all your onliners, the song composed by Raman "Oo Chiku tu Aisa kyun...", Diwali at home, dance in second year and the helmet Incident. I had awesome fun with this guy. you are an awesome friend, will cherish all the moments spent together.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>As soon as he enters the room, there is anticipation in everyone's mind. Any moment now, a few words would be uttered from his mouth, which would in all possibility succeed in leofying someone. As a byproduct there will be outbreak of laughter around him and henceforth everyone will watch there words. Because anyone of them could be the next target. No one has ever tried to leofy him, even if someone tried, they fell into their own dig. Such is the charisma of his character. Hail the unconquered, the king of all good times, the one and only - Chirag. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Phew. The above few lines about him came quite naturally. And I think I have done justice in portraying his character or that part of his character, at least.<br>For last two years he has been my wingmate, before that our interaction was quite feeble except on the basketball court. I remember and cherish all the BC sessions that took place in our wing. He has always been an entertainer, phrasing his valuable words very carefully, not to waste a syllable. I think I have said enough about it already. <br>If I were to admire someone for his determination, self-confidence and hard-work(notice the AND operator here), this guy would be on top of that list. I have seen him preparing for CAT exams. Although fate didnt favor him this time, I am sure it wont escape the next time.<br>He likes to be in his own little world and that would be his room and his laptop <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, well most of the times. He manages to remains composed in most of the situations unless someone is trying to pull his leg. In fact the reaction that he gives when someone is pulling his leg changes him into an entirely new person. But I wont be the judge. <br>He also has a fetish for doing heroic things, dude thats my stuff <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. I mean who wants to jump off a two storeyed building; he is always running his fingers through his hair, setting them in place; has recently developed an all new style of walking (arms stretched sideways at 45 degrees to horizontal and legs slightly more parted than they should be).</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>All said and done, I would like to give you a piece of advice. Be more outgoing, dynamic you are, show that to the world. Start taking the lead. I think that's what you lack. I wish all the very best for your life ahead, I might not be with you but I would only be a call apart. And of course I wouldnt need to call you, you can hear me where ever you are <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>God bless you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He becomes very passionate<img src=Smileys/51.gif /> when it comes to Basketball, play it very well aur 3 pointers to gajab leta hai !!! but many a times he din't get a chance to play in top 5 for the house because of his height but jab bhi khela ultimate khela.....<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Ek kamjori bhi hai iski <img src=Smileys/4.gif />!!! saala sab ki bahut gandi leta hai but jab khud ki deni padti hai to gussa<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> karne lag jata hai!!!! aur baad main kaheta hai abe vo to syle hai taki log le naa<img src=Smileys/21.gif />..... that made us somtimes angry on him...but In n all Banda heera hai !!! <br><br>Now he again almost became pappu's future room partner so definitely lot more fun has to come in his life....A great friend indeed !!! seriously bhai telling u from my deep heart directly that bahut miss karnga tujhe<img src=Smileys/20.gif /> aur vo saari yaadein like humara DBMS project, Felicity08 nights, n all outings, tera holi wala incident where we all got very worried about you ....these memories are more than enough to recollect out past and we will definitely enjoy jab hum inhe yaad karenge....don't forget me ever..I'll be there for you always !!<br><br>May our friendship last forever!!!<br><br><br>for you::<br>oo mere chiku , oo mere chiku oo re mere chiku <br>tu aisa kyun hai bol mere chiku<br>kaise tere baal<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> hain bole tu kamal hai<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>tu itana jaldi sota hai bol mere chiku <br><br>tu hamara yaar hai bada pornstar hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>tere hero wale video jaipur me kamal hai <br>oo mere chiku , oo mere chiku oo re mere chiku <br>tu aisa kyun hai bol mere chiku<br><br>12:30 bajte hi tera tyre<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> chikhe <br>mujhko aage badhana hai<img src=Smileys/77.gif />, mujhko sona hai<br>chiku hamara chiku , <br>tu aisa kyun hai bol mere chiku<br><br>bhai tu Jaisa bhi bahut achcha hai .. be the same atleast for me!!!

<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>CHIRAG aka chiku aka CCC aka Pornstar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ............<br><br>Whenever I see him, first thing that comes into mind is his dedication towards everything, be it studies, movies, sitcoms, BCes or even body building<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. In the first year, he seemed to be very innocent but later I realised he is just opposite<img src=Smileys/13.gif />, a quick witted guy who is always ready to leofy everyone whenever he gets a chance, never ever miss it. vaise to He is quite calm, never share a lot but jab koi party yaa outing hoti hai sab se jyada josh me yahi raheta hai ......khas kar ki jab daaru peene jate hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif />tab to ye overexcited ho jata hai ...aur sab ki gande walli leta hai .....<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>Whenever I need somebody to talk to on any subject, be it studies or gossip, I choose him in the top list...Aur iske fhatto ki to kya hi baat karu <img src=Smileys/41.gif />....bahut fhatte marta hai chupke se aur kisi ko kano kaan khabar bhi nahi lagti.. but very often he cracked awesome jokes as well ...hats off to you for that....<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He is one of the most sincere guy in IIIT and if I would have the right to give an award for the most consitent performer then he would probably be the winner and that is why he also managed to maintain a good CGPA and a decent job too which is quite admirable. He has a peculier style of saying "abe shaniwar ko chalte hai" whenever I ask him to go out on weekdays<img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br><br>His presence in any situation makes the whole environment very light. Many a times he has been the reason for our laughs, humesha kuch bachkani harkat karta hai aur to aur lagta bhi bikul bachche jaisa hai. Ye ek aisa banda jiski sab se banti hai aur kisi se kabhi ladai nahi karta hai ...always been good to others.. but kabhi kabhi mujhse ladta hai<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but baad me sab kuch settle ho jata hai ... but really dost!! sorry for every fight which occured between us.. tu bhi janta hai whatever I did wrong at that time, I din't mean it ... kuch galtiya ho hi jati hai .... <br><br>(cont...)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br>Then we really enjoyed when we were preparing for the inter-house dance event with Tava in lead. We danced on Vassa, padha roop karambu etc songs and we did enjoy that. I can never forget that time and the way we used to prepare. In a class room, by removing all the desks and then rearranging those at the end. I also remember a very funnny incident where Maroo was leofying Chand and he was trying to hit us. Chand was outside. Suddenly this guy went into the room, wore a helmet and came out like a fighter or knight or something. He gave damn good expressions and that was probably the funniest moment of IIIT for atleast me, Chand and him. Daaroo peekar to paagal ho jata hai. RDB style koodna chahta hai. Apni body par kaanch fodna chahta hai aur pata nahi kya kya. Holi par to kaand hi kar diya tha mahashay ne. We all got really worried. Is time jab club 8 gaya tha to aakar logon ki jam kar maari thi (Ankiet ki, Raman ki, Kshitiz ki aur bhi bohoton ki), maza aa gaya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.Abhi aage baad mein kabhi likhunga. Poona mein full aish kariyo. Mast-2 bandiya ghumana tu aur pappu, dono milkar. AUr hamein mat bhoolna. Call karte rehna time to time. Keep in touch buddy. I don't wanna loose contact with an awesome friend like you. May God give you all the success in your life. CAT ke liye saath prepare karenge aur hopefully fir se batchmates banenge <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br>Chiku<br><br>Is bande ke saath kafi memories associated hain. But let me start with an intro kinda thing of this guy. The first thing I notice about him is sincerity in whatever he does. This guy is good at studies. Kuch bhi kaam ho, hamesha exact time par poora mil jayega. The only guy in our group who still sticks to a timetable. Even Maroo has changed now. His sincerity could be seen while preparing for CAT as well. He is a very good basketball player. I find him a quick learner. Abhi-abhi volleyball khelna shuru hua and he became quite good at that. This guy knows what he has to do and when to do that and it's not that, he just knows, but he also does that. Bcbaaz to hai hi. Logon ki mast leta hai. This guy is damn witty. He is well known for his class one-liners. Seriously man, tera naam yaad aate hi sabse pehle yahi yaad aayega ki tu kya mast one-liner maarta tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I think you are like Chandler from FRIENDS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . But jab bhi iski lene ki koshish karo, to chidh jaata hai (meri tarah <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) . Sabse bade kamine ka competition bhi rehta hai iske aur mathure ke beech mein but jeet ta hamesha yahi hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . This guy is a very good dancer as well. Now why didn't I mention this quality above where I mentioned most of his qualities. This is so because some memories are associated with him when it comes to dance. I clearly remember the first time when we first-timers were preparing to dance on stage. At the last moment, we got to know that one of the guys won't be dancing. Then we requested chika to join us in place of that guy and after some requests, this guy agreed and I was shocked to see that he learnt all of the dance steps very soon and did a perfect dance with all of us on stage. That's when I got to know that he is not just a good dancer, but a very quick learner as well.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The story goes back to first year when I used to visit pappu's room quite frequently and as he was pappu's room-mate we did get to know each other. But at that time it was more like aquaintainces then friends. But then TB happened and we became good friends.<br>This guy is a hell lot of fun to be with. He has a tipical way of leofying people, arjun ke teer types nishana hai iska ... ekdum sahi point par lagta hai. Par hamesha bhi aisa nahi hota .. log sochte hain ki ye hamesha acche hi jokes marta hai .. but hes clever than that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Ye pehle bat dheere se bolta hai taaki kisi 1 bande ka reaction dekh sake .. agar accha hua to phir jor se bolega to get a LOL from the mob <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And somehow most of the times wo 1 banda main hi hota hu <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>I have had one of the worst experience of my college life with him. Jab inhone 3rd yr ki holi me bhang chadha li thi .. aur bathroom me gir gaye the. Me and madu carried him to hospital and damn nurse told me to hold his head while she stitches his head .. I was like wtf <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Then the night out in hospital when every other second some or the other patient in room will puke or suffocate while breathing .. hell!! hospitals are BAD <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>After I moved into his wing in 4th yr .. we 've had loads of BC sessions. specially while placements.While his CAT preperations when the whole wing used to do BC in night he used to sleep at time. And the next day tell us all that we discussed about ... and says 'saala main bistar par lete-lete has raha tha' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Theres one thing about this lad that he cares just too much about the surrounding people, and what they think about him. Sometimes hes not himself, he doesn't put his point outrightly .. always wants to play safe, go with the mob. Buddy I will advise you, for once, try risking .. be confident and you can achieve anything. you have the caliber you just need the confidence to crack anything.<br>Well, in the end .. I 'll remember him as One of my good friends, expert in leofying people, my wingmate, apna indori bhai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Hope to see you in hyderabad buddy. Theres more to come <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best ...<b> researcher</b> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br> </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Chirag, or more popularly known as Cheeka, is one of those few guys who have not changed in the course of last four years. For him, it can definitely be said that he is just the same as he was 4 years back. One of the shortest guys in the batch, he is a proper timetable. Though Maroo was also a timetable earlier but he has changed a lot in the last 1 year. But Chirag, he is still a timetable. He has a fixed schedule for everything and he just sticks to that unless there's some special ocassion. He is the one who has attended least number of BC sessions. Very sincere and dedicated towards everything he do. Very good at academics.<br>Though he is very short, he is very good at basketball. Recently when we started playing volleyball, he played that too with perfection. He as maintained a decent CG throughout and got placed with a good package. <br>When it comes to leofying, no one can beat him. During BC sessions, he just release some witty quotes in between that leaves everyone laughing. He is one of the wittiest guys I have seen. But when some one tries to leofy him, his obvious reply is "haan bas tu to rehne hi de". He cannot take anything said against him and that's why gets angry very easily. I feel he needs to change in this aspect. <br>He never opens up and this is the reason why no one knows much about him. He never shares his personal life with others. Most of the time he just stays in his room and one can find him only during the meals in mess.<br>When drunk, he just becomes a superhero and always try to do something or the other which they do. He just run here and there, climb on the walls, insists on jumping from the wall and many more such super stunts....<br><b> Most memorable moment <b> would be Holi incident in 3rd year <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>We have not interacted much. So I cannot say much about him. But all I know is he is quite friendly and will do wonders in future. Just be more open towards relationships <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Good luck. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

He's the kind of silent guy living next door who suddenly bumps in and cracks jokes on everyone and comes alive for a short period of time and then goes back to his den again. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. His sense of humor is aaaahsome!<br><br>Cheekus swimmings bhi kartaa hai. bahut achi karta hai. mujhe isine sikhaya.<br><br>But the most unforgettable moment in my life was when Cheeku was all drunk and came to me and said "Abe range .. chal building ke oopar se RDB pose karte hain." Back then I didn't know how to control such situations. The fact is we both went near the building then I said "Abe tu bahut hil raha hai . aaj nahi kal karte hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". But saala he didn't agree with me and started running helter-skelter and ran like a mouse on seeing me or Chand bhai. That day I got brain-fucked be! But it was a memory worth remembering. That brought us much closer.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>All in all, Chirag has been one of my very good friends at IIIT. May God bless!<br><br><b><br>Character he resembles: Rotlu from Jaane Tu.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: All the meals after AIMCATs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Message for him: Think about relationships.<br></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>The next thing you'll notice is that he can be hilarious at times. Coming with the masti-waala attitude, he is the king at leofying people and not getting leofyied himself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He has a whacky sense of humour, and the timing of his comments is often impeccable <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Even when he manages to crack those PJs, he does so in mota's ears <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> However, you'll get an adverse reaction when you do get around to leofying him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Everytime you do that, he'll say, "Haan saale! Tu to aise mat bol" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Chirag, however, is dedicated and sincere when it comes to his work. Always the one to do things on time and in order, he generally lives the day according to a schedule. For example, I admire the fact that he always has his bath before lunch time, which is a rarity <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> When he has a particular goal in mind, he silently goes about doing his job with focus and dedication in heart and spirit. However, along with this also comes the rone waala attitude <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I think he needs to change here and be more positive about things around him.<br><br>One more aspect of his which can change is being more open about the talents he possesses. For ex, hes a pretty good dancer, but is always reluctant to do so. Hes also quite good as basketball, and plays in the intra college tournaments. <br><br>But well, along with these also comes the control which he exercises in most aspects of his lives. I mention most, because there is always the daaro <br>exception. He goes berserk when a little alcohol is in his body, and is sometimes fun to watch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> What was not fun, though, was the Holi incident (it was memorable though). That day, Piyush and I feared really bad things. Thank God, you got out of that situation!<br><br>The other things I'd remember are the work he put in for Felicity '08, daaro sessions with him, taking various courses and BTP together, preparing for CAT and all those AIMCATs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ..<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>The first thing which I'd say about Chirag is that he was the first friend I made in IIIT. Also it comes with that- hes been one person who I've been friends for the longest time (along with Adi). I dont know how we met, but I remember meeting his grandpa at the start of the semester. I still remember that I'd regularly visit his room (totally ignoring his roomie) very often. Those were the days when the three of us - Adi, Chirag and me would hang out together quite frequently- I can recall all those visits to Pizza hut, the movies etc. Back then, we were the sincere kinds- all that changed after the gang was formed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>What you'd notice about Chirag is that though he is friendly, he never opens up. Even after four years, none of us feel that hes ever shared with us. Well one of the reasons for the same is that Chirag is the kind of a guy who does not think too much about relationships. For him, the funda of relationships is quite different- little skirmishes do not affect it, Which is always good. When it comes to other things in life, he does share- but zilch in terms of relationships. Its good in a way that it does not leave scope for getting hurt. However, it leads to a feeling among the ones around him that hes not ready to come close enough to them which is a little unfortunate. For it creates a kind of a line or a wall which cannot be breached by anyone. I think the cure for this is from both ends; from the side of friends, they need to understand him and from the side of Chirag.. Well my suggestion is try telling your parents that you love them <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Its the best starting point)<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>What better way to start the account by writing my first testimonial for my x-roomy - Chirag Nahar aka Chika aka Chiku aka porn star. One of the wittiest kids around, he is a good combination of sincerity, discipline and 'masti-wala' attitude. Always ready to crack a fatta here and there and leofy everyone's, he is always ready to have fun. <br><br>Dedication towards academics is one of his core qualities.He is a decent basketball player and a good swimmer. But his shyness takes the better of him at times. For instance, he can dance well but will never do it on stage. Also his constancy restricts him from doing some extravagant things. An advice I would like to give him would be to be more pro-active in relationships. <br><br>We have had our share of hilarious moments like his 'dost', imaginary fighting sequence, daaru at Felicity and many more. We have spend some splendid times together doing regular day-to-day stuff. <br><br>Wishing you all the success in future bro. May God Bless you. Have a happy time at Infy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
