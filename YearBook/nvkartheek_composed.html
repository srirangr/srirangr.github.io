<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I want to write a lot of things about him ... but right now I am afraid ( I have to be in this campus for one more year <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> )  to put it simply he is a person who has a cool head on his shoulders, having a great amount of perseverance. Passionate about a lot of things and good at most of them. <br>   One of the very few people I know to convert from B Tech to dual degree, I really appreciate him for that. He is very kind to me .. he has never hurt me in the numerous number of football matches we have played <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br>       All the best to you lashi ..

<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br> Ranjalkar aka D J Ranga ...I have never seen him without a smile on his face. One would seldom feel bored when he is around, Maruti has put in a better way "ticket to infinite bc". <br><br>   I still remember the cricket matches in the previous summer, we had a lot of fun. He has invented a very special technique to get the batsman out, "bowl three wides before a right one" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> That is just an example for the infinite creativity this guy has. He is an "awesome" story teller.<br> "Ranga nuvvu bumper ehe" <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br><br>   </b></i></ul><br><br>
