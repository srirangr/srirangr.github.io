<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In my first year I wrote a testimonial for him on orkut. The lines started like "Innocence personified" and even after four years<br>I would stick to it. In the first month whenever  anyone asked him to give an introduction he had a common answer... "main Maruti hoon, goa ka hoon par 16 saal se hyderabad mein hoon<img src=Smileys/10.gif />". He is a person who is always pepped up. Has the best<br>smile. When he starts laughing its difficult to stop yourself as well, He cracks some of the best PJs. I can term him as a best roomy(after Manish<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/10.gif />) anyone can have, his and bhalu's tale as roommates were very popular. I have some really sweet memories with this chap, be it the funda session walk after he got an F in EC(which was later changed to D<img src=Smileys/10.gif />), the Dosas he used to get for all of us, dancing together on the song "Ari Ari" not once but twice, the imli waala incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and all the BC we had in our first and the second year. Things went for a spin in the third year, we hardly met but whenever we saw each other we greeted each other with a vibrant<br>smile. Then came the last semester, I thought that he would have probably changed but I was happy to see he is still the same innocent guy with a smile on his face. We are back to our good old days, I must admit he has the best "sutta" marene ka style. I can never forget the recent boozing incident  when he was crawling to reach us to grab a cigg it was freaking hilarious, our all recent chai stall visits and BC in OBH wings. I just regret one thing, We missed on you for almost two years. You are a great friend ,<br>Maruti and I am glad that things are back to normal. ab dono Banglore mein hai... it feels great to have a friend placed  in the same city <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>ultimate waali BC pelenge...Still the booze treat is pending <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Daddu<br><br>Daddu and me had an interesting friendship story,<br>I remember how close we were in the first two months. In the first year we got an assignment in the English class to describe a friend and I wrote his description and got a special remark from Ma'am for the description. I remember supporting him for the CRs post going to batchmates room asking them to vote for him but things change a lot after the C assignment incident. We were friends and we are still friends. We had our shares of ups and downs, I did not support him much during the Coordinatorship thing and we had our arguments then. I hold major part of the blame but he worked his arse off for the fest he was damn got in sponsorship getting two major sponsors. For me "he is the best CR" and some of the things he has done in the college is truly commendable. Time and again I have not supported you and there were my reasons for it but believe me we all are aware of the work you have done for our batch and for our college. You have been a great friend. You have immense leadership qualities and you have amazing ability to deal with people. I hope you reach great heights.<br>Daddu bhai a sincere thanks for the batch trips<br>and hopefully this one will be a dream trip.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I<br><br>Adi!<br><br>For the introduction, "We have always been good friends" this is what we always say to each other. I have many memories associated<br>with this guy. We were friends from the day one. He was my neighbour in First Year. Everyday after class I would come to his room. We used to have discussions on any random topic, be that the idea<br>of forming the group(still remember how much against you and Maroo were) He would everytime ask me to close the window fearing that he would catch cold and I would refuse. He is damn intelligent, walking wikipedia. Its difficult to argue with him because most of the times he is right. I follow a simple rule whatever Adi says, Is right. In the first year he was bit shy. Especially with girls. But, he has special corner for NIFT girls <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Adi had a standard dressing sense, you could always spot him in an orange formal shirt properly tucked. He is damn sophosticated. Its fun to hear when he speaks in English, bhai itne formal hote hain. And if you do a favour he would politely reply "Thank You". Aah, in first couple of year he and Maroo pressed everyone to speak in English, they both spoke to each other in English, but we never joined them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We have studied many subjects together right from the first to fourth,  be it Maths I or EPDS we always studied at the last moment. He is a lazy ass, we both. We had taken Human Desires course and we studied together, we had mugged the whole of wikipedia but during exam he did not write an answer to a question just because he was feeling lazy.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>Me and Adi had special affinity towards CG. I remember, in the first year we used to predict everyone's  CG. It was funny when we actually messaged everyone their CG.He is a great athlete, we both use to jog together in third year. I used<br>to stop early and he used to go till HCU. He is one of the best coders in the batch. He reads Cormen like a novel. Adi is the worst dancer I have come across. I remember, I was teaching him a very simple step and he couldn't even learn that step, finally I had to give up<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In the first year, I remember we were fighting for fun and I pushed him and got him hurt, during his Birthday when we all threw him up in the air and forgot to grab him back <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He has tickle-phobia. Even if you swirl your fingers he starts laughing.<br>Back in first year, when ever he had an issue with anyone he would come to my room and tell me the matter. He was the one who introduced me to rock(Thanks for that). I would ask him to send me the songs I should hear and he would give me a list of songs which I might like.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part III<br><br>I never imagined Adi would drink, infact he would become one of the biggest beweda. I remember in the Vizag trip, we were sharing the same room, I was bit drunk and this motherfucker did not allow me to come inside the room. I had to plead him to let myself in <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Me, Adi and Bhalu have been the most regular drinkers. Where there is booze there will atleast one of us. When Adi is drunk he never stops talking. We have boozed together uncountable times. First it was white mischief then it was beers. We had some of our best moments drinking together. Me and Adi have been TT partners as well, it is fun to watch him and Manish playing. Its like you are watching India and Pakistan playing a match. He doesn't beleive in leofying anyone. But gets leofied royally. The best part is he never gets irritated. He is the one who plans most of the group outings and that too all of a sudden. He is not a movie buff, but he likes all the Martin Scorcese flicks. I remember, Me you and Maroo came third in the Dumb C. Adi is a branded guy <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, he doesn't wear anything which is not branded. He only wears Levis, has a swiss watch. He is crazy about cars. Man! I still remember that Aston Martin we saw on our way to 36 jubilee hills, freaking awesome.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part IV<br><br>Adi worked his arse off for Felicity. He and Pagare wanted to make the Rock Show one of the biggest in the city. I remember, how we all landed on the name "RIders on the Storm". He was damn passionate about this event. He did A-Z for the event, we both got the sponsor. Aah! meeting with Anjani in the Irani Cafe was an interesting experience. You did a great job!  "Riders on the storm" was undoubtedly one the biggest rock gigs in the city.  Though Felicity '07 was not a very memorable event for both of us. I remember, he so wanted to host the event but he couldn't and how upset he was, I still feel guilty for that.<br>He has done a commendable job as a placement coordinator. "Everyone in the batch respects the amount of grit and determination you have shown".<br>during the placements. I remember, how upset he was when Microsoft did not take any one. He literally fought with the HR, once he also shouted at the Captal IQ HR. Seriously be, I bow to you for the work you have done. I still remember, the reaction of you and Maroo when I got placed. In all it has been a great journey with you Adi.<br><br>Some Memories- tickle-phobia, all the BC sessions we  had in NBH-146,148,OBH "Riders on the Storm", studying together and finally all the boozing sessions we had! We have always been good friends and it will always be like that.<br><br>Adi rocks!<br><br>Cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I<br><br>Madoooooooooooooooo<br><br>Maroo & Me(sounds like Marley & Me)<br>This testimonial is for one of my closest friends in IIT and for a person I truly admire and respect. My first impression of him was of some kickass stud, but baad mein baat karke pata chala bhaiya to kuch alag hi hain. He came from Sri Satya Sai school had not interacted with girls for<br>like two years <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We both got along from the day one. Back in the first year, we used to have BC sessions with him and Mridul arguing over stupid issues like how many runs were scored on the 43rd over of some random match. He was all phadaku types in the first year. He used to come to our wing in the first year to ask doubts and we would ask him to do sit ups before asking a doubt<br>and he would naively agree. He had the highest collection of porn in the first year which sounds pretty logical considering the fact that<br>he was in some Boys schools and had not seen girls for almost like two years. I still remember our antics on his roommate , Karan ki Kiran and irritating him by just saying one line "Maroo tu gay hai?". He was damn organized from the first day but interestingly this never relflected in the state of his room. He would plan out his day and used to sleep sharp at twelve.But that was Maroo in first year. Many people have testified on how dedicated he is  towards his work and I am<br>just going to substantiate that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>Maroo for me is an epitome of dedication and sincerety. I still remember  My orkut testimonial to him in the first year. I had written how much I have learned from him. And even after four years the equation remains the same. He has surprised us with his dedication, I still remember when he was back after writing CAT, he underperformed and was not expecting many calls.<br>He was dejected, but the next thing he asked me was "What should I study for placements?"<br>He woke up at 6 am the next day and started with placement preparation. Maroo, has defined priorities , he knows what he wants to do and works for it. At times he has missed on some good moments because of his commitments. But, he has<br>always made up for it. He worked his arse off for our seniors Felicity'07. No doubt, that he was the Felicity Coordinator of Felicity'08. Maroo is straightforward. He will tell you right on your face about what he feels about you. Tough, he changed a lot during his coordinatorship journey. Bande mein thoda ego hai and at times he behaves like a kid. He would say "main usse baat nahin karunga kyun ki woh mujhse baat nahin kar raha hai<img src=Smileys/10.gif />" But bhai ke liye , he never got his ego in the middle. Whenever we had an argument one of us<br>would take the initiative and phir se BC chalu.He has immense respect across all the batches. I still remember how the whole batch supported him when he was caught in the "ragging case".<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part III<br><br>Coming to the lighter side, Maroo is more or less blind. Has uncanny resemblance with Akshay Khanna.<br>Has a weird laughter. Interestingly, he changes his style of laughter with people.Has all the qualities of a Marwari. For him, 120 bucks Chocolate Avalanche is cheaper than 15 bucks Dosa. He is the only person who is as good as me in Hindi. Loves debating. He can debate on any arbit and senseless topic. Likes to carry his angry young man look, best part is when you disturb him when he is working on something and the "oh! I will kill you" look is damn hilarious. Its quite easy to leofy him. He knows this and recently after following the footsteps of his guruji he has managed to leofy others as well.<br>For the record, he is an awesome orator, decent cricketer, phodu in acads and a pathetic dancer, pathetic in biking. I will miss all those BC sessions we had ranging from Girls, politics, College, who is better SRK or Aamir! He would come to our room and ask us to accompany him to fill water bottles. How can I forget, small fights we used to have over mobile charger. How much he gets irritated over our late night BC. Every morning he would come to me and<br>say "I couldn't sleep properly because I could hear you laughing all the time". Me, Manish and Bhalu always chose the part in front of his room for our Late Night BC. Maroo bhai se sabh darte hain, we are all chickens in front of him because you never know when he is going to blast at you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part IV<br><br>Felicity '08, perhaps the most important chapter for both of us. We had a point to prove to our seniors, who never really believed we could make a fest bigger then theirs. I still remember how irritated we used to get whenever they mocked at our batch. It was an awesome ride, We had<br>our moments working for the fest. He is damn organized, which really helped our Fest. Every step was well planned and executed. Aah, his attachment with the fest was so much that he really stopped socialising. I have worked for three batches Felicity and for me you have been the best coordniator. I know how important and precious it is when you have someone at the helm of the fest who believes that all his peers are the coordinators and not him. Me and him, we both have organized many events together, right from<br>freshers to Felicity. We have had endless BC on "Campus sudharo" topics. On the third day of the fest, he drank for the first time and got damn emotional. Man, he cried for the whole night and kept praising each and everyone in the batch.<br>Four years with him, we have had many cherisable moments. We have been through our share of ups and downs. It was sweet of him when he came to me and said "for you I will never have my ego in between" and I can only say that neither will I.<br>Some Memories, First years leofying, organizing Freshers, getting you drunk on the last day of the fest, every bit of Felicity'08, your dhissum dhissum, TB ki ladayi(the meeting you organized near the old felicity stage), your love for LP and how much we hated it, your tantrums for me not taking you home, our recent club 8 trips and for all your support. Maroo, you have been an awesome friend. I know you will achieve success in whatever you do. All the best bhai aage ke liye...<br>Phod dena!<br><br><br>Cheers!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Chiku!!<br><br>To start with, me and Himank came up with an award for him that was "Castrol award for consistent performance". He hasn't changed<br>a bit from the first year. He has religiously followed his schedule. He is very sincere, be it academics, CAT preparation or basketball. I owe my<br>most hilarious incident in IIIT to him, it happened way back in the end of the second year in NBH, when I was leofied by the group, I got<br>irritated and started hitting people.The next thing I remember,Chika agressively sprungs up wearing a helmet, the expression he had cannot be<br>expressed in words. Chika is known for his awesome onliners. He also cracks PJs but he tells it secretly to Mota <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He doesn't like when someone pulls his leg, the next reaction comes is "tu to rahene hi de...". I remember our first Dumb C competition and he was not able to guess a movie <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and the fight we had after that<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Chika doesn't really opens up, I remember pestering him "Bhai chike tu aaj aape bare mein kuch bata" and he would get irritated. Whenever he used to go home I used to say "ki isbaar kuch kaand karke aana". He wanted to be a hero but landed in IIIT, his body language is worth noticing, sometimes he keeps on styling his hairs, flexes his muscles when know one is noticing, starts boxing in the air. This motherfucker leofied me a lot in first year. He and Pagare would never get bored pulling my leg. Interestingly we could never come up with any good nick for him, tough we tried, the whole "tubelight thing", "Po** Star" but nothing really worked. He was my BTP partner, I wanted him to do the whole BTP but saale ne kaat diya. He gets into a very different "SuperHero" mode when he is drunk.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The Part Twos<br><br>Aah! I will remember the RDB thing, dragging you to your room after the booze party of Felicity'08,<br>Bhai's Holi kaand and the story they cooked up after that, recent Club 8 visit and the question he asked me, BTP ka kaam, cursing our BTP guide, all your onliners, the song composed by Raman "Oo Chiku tu Aisa kyun...", Diwali at home, dance in second year and the helmet Incident. I had awesome fun with this guy. you are an awesome friend, will cherish all the moments spent together.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ganja <br><br>Man with many names. Just to name a few "Ganja", Aksay, Takla ... and list goes on and on. Everyday he has a new name. According to me<br>he is best looking guy in our batch. I have leofied him the most. But he never got irritated, except once. I remember the incident near felicity stage. I seriously went overboard, he got so irritated he threw my shoes in the puddle of mud <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Ganja and I have had some really memorable outings, the sutta sessions we had together. I so wanted him to be placed, I gave him my lucky charm and I am sure "He" was with you when you got placed. Ganja is damn creative.<br>He is the photographer of our group. You can always find pics of arbit thigs like glasses, spoons etc in our outings pics. He was awesome in Felicity. The way he managed the whole Kalakshetra is commendable!<br>He has been leaving in hostel from 8th class and he is so adjusted to the hostel life. He is so calm and composed I never seen him angry, again<br>except once, remember the Goa trip when me, Bhalu and others were talking loud at night and he bursted at us, we couldn't hold our self laughing.<br>I will never forget the "Aksay Kumar" jokes and it is only because he made all those moments so special. When the situation demands he can act very pragmatically. He was directionless for the first two years. Hardly saw him with books, all I remember of him is , him watching movies. He managed well in the end. I am proud of you! We share a special equation.<br>I have enjoyed a lot in your company, be it long bike rides, the jokes or arbit BC sessions with a sutta in our hand.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Some Memories- the whole Aksay Kumar Episode, Coming up with new names,long bike rides, our first long walk in second year, the goa trip,the whole insomnia epsisode,DBMS project,whole roommate thingy<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/10.gif />, leofying you all the time, playing dart game in your room, the "names of Ganja thread" in orkut, all the BCs we had with a sutta in hand.<br>Aksay bhai we had some freaking awesome moments together! Thanks for being there.I sincerely hope that you achieve things that you have set out for, remember your wishlist.<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mathura is one of my good friends in IIIT.<br>I see him as a person who socialises with every one. You can find him doing BC in the first floor and second floor. He is there in everyone's birthday, he hardly misses any outings. I remember, in the third year he used to stay in the third floor and we were in second but he hardly went to his room. We had<br>endless BC sessions then. For the people, he is among the best when it comes to TT, he is<br>among the best gamers in the batch. We have particpated in many Felicity events and won also <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br>I call him "laal chipkali". He turns red even if you shout at him, if you hit him hard<br>the whole body gets red, I remember Himank scratching him with a comb and the mark remained for a hell lot of time and when we pulled his cheeks hard his lips were as if somebody kissed him, aah! the funny part was he had to attend a marriage after that. He is very short temepered. I remember, how angry he was in Ganja's room. But, he has reduced a lot. He is a kid at heart, had some really weird fundas about friends which I don't really think he really believes in. For me he has been a Chotta bhai types. I still remember the scuffle incident and when the juniors got agressive at him and the series of events after that. He has been more than helpful at times. The sweetest part was, he would buy stuffs to eat for the night out which he would share with none, but he never refused me. Whenever I was hungry at night I would go to his room. He is not what many take him as, he is a person who really trusts his friends and this motherfucker never really accepts that. He is a very different person when he is drunk, had some really personal talks after that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>Some Memories- All the late night brunches, chai stalls visits, getting you red, TT matches in first year, Cache In, Club 8 visits, T***I incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, late night BCs in the wing, "Oye light chale gayi oye", talks we had after we were high. You are a great friend. Thanks for being there bhai. I know you will compelete your MS in time (Just try to improve PR in LTRC <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>Cheers!!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankits.html>Ankit Saraswat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mote<br>He is my sutta partner. Whenever we meet the first question we ask each other is "sutta hai?".<br>He is the classic example of first impression going wrong. First look, he always had a lazy eye and a thumping gait. Did not talk much in the first year apart from some ragging sessions together. Bhai was the ten pointer in first sem, but now he has come above grades after his experiences in the fourth sem.<br>After third year we came to OBH and our short ciggs sessions started. Whenever I am in shortage of ciggs I visit his room. I have never seen a person as brainy as him.  He is the best when it comes to teaching any stuff. He would take the notes read it for half an hour and teach<br>everyone, he would also explain things which were never discussed in the class. I still remember during placement time, he was worried about not getting through Amazon.I asked him how was his interview ? He said "yaar unke questions kam pad gaye the to unhone na! BC, MC ek tough DP ka question de diya". He never eats in the campus, you can always find him in McD or Subway. He is one guy who would always stand for his friends.<br>"Bhai dil ke bahut aache hain".I still remember, one day how sad he was because he did not interact with many people in the batch.  He has very simple funda about life, never really works hard. He knows that he can manage a nine CG even if he studies half an hour before the exam.<br>Anytime you go, you could find something to eat in his room. He is an avid gamer and flaunts a PSP. <br>Some Memories- all the sutts we had together, your algorithm ke funde during placements, night out just before the day placement started, subway ki trip.<br>I admire him a lot for his modesty. I wish  you achieve great heights mote!<br><br>Cheers!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I<br><br>Bhalu and Me.<br><br>A testimonial for my Best friend and a testimonail for myself! <br>Looking back, I had just heard of him in the first month here, rumours floating like<br>there is some dumb ass nerd who has completed the C assignment in an hour. But met him pretty late in cellar, he looked dumb in the beginning.<br>But we jelled well. This guy is perhaps the fastest brains I have come across. He calculates powers of 2 for fun, remembers  vehicles registration numbers. tries to find out arbit relation between any number sequence, multiplies numbers just for the heck of it, counts stairs while climbing them. Has a feminine brain, he is damn good at multitasking, he can play strip poker, do an assignment and can watch a movie at the same time. For many he is irritating, has a habit of biting his nails. He is bad at remembering faces, for him all the<br>strangers look alike. Its fun to hear him singing.. have you heard an old tape recorder when the voice gets squeaky, if not then you can ask this guy to sing, especially "Kal ho Na Ho".<br>Has an interesting laughing style,spins his head while laughing. A sloth, he has placed his bed in the middle of the room so that he could access everything from the bed itself. How can I forget<br>his prolonged "So raha hoon be" whenever I ask him to come out of his room.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>I have never seen him serious about his acads still he manages to do good. He has a wierd explanation to it, he believes that he fails in things for which he sincerely works! And interestingly he has managed to do good<br>without much effort. But, saying this doesn't mean he is not serious or dedicated about anything. He loves to blog, which he believes<br>is the only thing to which he has been committed for so long. He is perhaps the most popular blogger of the college and his blog is<br>more popular then him. He loves Maths which is pretty evident. Loves Sachin Tendulkar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> aah! I have had some interesting question rounds with him on this topic "If you love Sachin Tendulkar then... " He has a great female following. Everyday, you can find him chatting with some<br>or the other girl. And when asked who she is, he has a typical answer "Abe dost hai be!" I have to admit, its fun reading his chats. Likes classic rock, aah! Beatles apun dono ka favourite.<br>likes listening to old crappy ghazals, loves watching black and white movies, die hard fan of Shammi Kapoor.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>We do BC almost every night, I know I am going to miss that. All those pillion rides together. Arbit incidents happen when ever we two are together. There are many things common about us. Be it , our opinion about people, our views and interestingly even our love life, the series of commonalities never seems to end. I am going to miss all this now, the late night BC with a sutta in our hand, how I would disturb him every fifteen minutes and gulp down his filled water bottle. He is a monsterous drinker. How can I forget when he drank the whole "khamba", fucking amazing. He is among the few with whom I have shared every bit of my life. Bhalu, you mean a lot to me as a friend. At times I have been a total jerk but he has always supported me.<br>Bhalu would never let us know when he is sad, this bastard is damn good at faking emotions. Whenever he is sad, he would pretend as if everything is fine. Remember, whatever you wrote for me applies to you as well. He is the entertainer of our group, because he is always upto something. Totally restless. He is a total fun freak, he never gets tired of it, I remember, he came from a long train journey and immediately left for Nagarjuna Sagar. If I have to booze he seldom gives a "NO" for an answer. Me, him Vipul and Adi we form an elite beveda group. I would<br>cherish all the BCs we had after we got drunk. I remember,When you let out your feelings for some girl near the Banyan Tree and the next reaction<br>from our side was "How screwed up are you man!". He has hidden a secret from all of us for very long and I hope my friend you get your girl <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part IV<br><br>Four years, it has been an amazing journey. I don't remember if we had an argument on anything. Some memories, the suttas we had together, Club 8<br>outings, tea at Manoj's stall, Victor ki sawari, going late for the class together,reading your chats, Leofying you, copying your singing style, finishing your paani ki bottle, the third day of Felicity when I saw you crying for the first time and that too for no reason(he couldn't see Maroo crying!), cursing you for writing stupid monotnous fucking long blogs, "spoj"ing together,asking you random numbers multipication, aapna bottoms up competition (which I won hands down), the support you gave me during placements, our late night BC sessions. These four years have been memorable for me, I never really had good friends before coming here.  But, my search for friends really came to an end here. You made these four years even more special and memorable.You have been an amazing friend, supportive, I owe a lot to you. Abhi, we will have boozing sessions in Banglore and Hyderabad.<br>All the best for your kiraaaaak journey ahead!<br><br>Cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Budhao/Bhai ---- PART I<br>Just to begin with "He is of my closest friends". A person who has been my strength in IIIT-H. He has always shown so much trust in me. A person who knows me so well. We have golden memories<br>together, A true friend, Vipul Bhai! This testimoial is special.<br><br>Surprisingly we never talked much in the firs two years. I knew him more as Raman's roommate. A person who keeps his room clean. He was very different in first two years, different as in<br>he did not socialise much. He had a friend circle and he was pretty much confined to that. Then we moved to OBH and he became my neighbour in third year and after that it has been a memorable journey with him. He is one person, I have always asked for favour and rarely did I do anything for him. He is the supplier of most of the things I need, right from the deospray,notebooks,pens and toothpaste. even when he is in a deep sleep I would bang his door wake him up and take the toothpaste. I have never felt uncomfortable asking him for a help. For the people, he is an awesome dancer, he is pretty much the best in his field of research that is LTRC. We have had many awesome memorable moments together. I remember right from the second year I have always tried all the new stunts on him, throttled him, "bhai bande ko leta leta ke maara hai".</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>On the lighter side, Vipul is pigeon chested, has infinite marks on his face, always carries a plain look. This motherfucker knows how to exaggerate things, we fondly call him Komolika.<br>He is so good at adding spice to stories and narrates them as if it is true. Has a feminine<br>touch to him, "thoda nazuk sa hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". He has leofied me the most, I am doomed when he comes to<br>pulling my leg. He treats me like a dog, whenever I come to his room he is so fucking damn rude<img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>I remember irritating him with late night BCs. He would come and shout at us(Me,Bhalu and Manish) the next morning. He has taught me NLP (I hope now you are happy!), he has done my assignments though he never worked on the projects and presentations I took with him. I have hardly seen him working on his thesis though he has good rapport with everone in LTRC <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. "Bhai PR se MS nahin milne waali". Bhai, was leaving in an entirely different world in the first two<br>years. He took up lot of things after coming to OBH, started listening to rock (Infact he is the only one who listens to death metal), started boozing and more than anything he started socialising. He is a total spend thrift, "Bhai kO LTRC waale muft ke paise dete hain aur ye udate hain". And it is fun to watch when Maroo scolds him for spending so much. He also started smoking but good for him that he left it. Bhai ko masaledar cheezien dekhna ka bada saukh hai.. suits his komolika image. Right from Big Boss, Roadies to splitsville he has watched all. When we are leofying him he suddenly goes silent.When he wants you out of his room he would go completely mum.<br>He  is the member of elite beweda club. I will miss the daroo get togethers we had. Whenever he is drunk, he gets out all his anger on me. In the last couple of drinking sessions he has got all senti an all. He will atleast cry once whenever he is drunk.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part III<br><br>It was because of a glass of beer I came to see a very different side of Vipul. Vipul is "exteremly" caring, its rare that a person is worried about you even when you are  not around him. He likes to be pampered. He doesn't let out his feelings to people easily. He trusts people<br>a lot. If he considers you a friend then he would blindly trust you. Again, he is one of my best critics and thanks for correcting me time and again. I remember, how many times he has come to me and told me about my mistakes. I am a self-praising person and he hates that(most of them do!). He just snaps back at me whenever he finds me self gloating. Vipul bhai is one of those who would keep his feelings inside, I mean if he is hurt he would not let us know. You have to pester him , ask him repeatedly. Bhai, chhoti chhoti baaton pe bhi gussa ho jaate hain. I remember, I came to campus after a very long ride and I was totally tired he asked me to accompany him to Subway; I refused and bhaisaab gussa ho gaye. He went alone after that. He gets angry  even if I unknowingly ignore him which shows how much possesive he is about his friends. At times , I have felt we have never stood up to his expectations, as a friend he has done a lot for all of us. He has always been there whenever I needed him, always stood by me. Vipul Bhai, I just want to tell you that I know that how much you have done for me and you have a special importance in my life.<br><br>Some Memories, Toothpaste incidents, we both leofying each other, all the club 8 outings,<br>you cursing me after you get drunk, leofying you for your feminine touch, all the long walks we had, taunting you for treating me bad. Now we will not be together and just to think of it I will not have some one to bug next door is eery. I got so used to irritating him , bang the door every morning and taunt him for some or the other thing. I am seriously going to miss you Budhao.<br>You are a great friend, I owe a lot to you!<br><br><br>Cheers!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mota and Me<br><br>I have a lot of memories associated with this person. Some are emotional, funny , irritating but truly memorable. My first meeting with him was pretty unusual, we almost fought. He used to come to Pagare and Chika's room and that was the time we started interacting. He is very emotional and sensitive. We had this leofying competition, we used to count "kaun kiski jyada leta hai". For the first two years he won, he is damn good when it comes to pulling someone's leg but after the "Mumme" incident I won hands down. For the people, he is very good artist, our poster boy, very sharp. He has great analytical skills. I still remember, how good he was in recursion. He was among the first ones to be placed which only<br>substantiate how good he is. I remember the time we spent together when he got an "F" in DB, in fact he deserved an A in the course. Though<br>it helped a lot, he taught all of us DBMS during placements. He has a good dressing sense, man! its hilarious to see when he gets ready for an outing. Second year was  terrible for him and I am glad you came out strong. "Bhai to abhi committed ka Tag leke ghumte hain and mandir mein ghumne jaate hain".<br>He is been misunderstood at times, we had our share of ups and downs. I will remember going to his room at around 2 am with a coffee cup in my hand just to find him doing some really necessary things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He loves biking, I know we scewed the whole bike trip idea, sorry for that. He is very adjusting; I have never seen him complaining about things. He did a terrific job in the design team. Got the whole campus vibrant. He and Sambhav worked day and night to ensure that the campus looks in the festive mood. I remember, me and him sketching the War of DJs poster. He seldom boozes but when he does , he is like a bull. I will always remember the hilarious stuffs you did in the recent Club8 visit. He has shared almost everything with me and I really love you for that. <br>We are good friends and the equation between us will never change.<br>All the best bhai.<br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Raman Bhai<br>For the first two years,I have misunderstood him.<br>I was rude back then. He is a gem of a guy. He doesn't have any negative feelings about anyone. He is lazy, loves sleeping. He has given us some of the most hilarious moments. I will never forget the "NIFT incident". Raman Bhai ke liye kuch embarassing nahin hota, he feels these are the moments he will cherish through out his life<br>and so true. He is a very good programmer, phodu TT player but he gets nervous on big ocassion, he has the talent to beat the best in the game but loses out due to temperament. He is doing MS under Jaws and working his arse off. It took time<br>to know this guy, he doesn't mean what he says, bhai dil se bahut aache hain. There are many stories of him which will go as legendary kisse, many have asked me to start a comic strip on Raman Bhai. Whenever he is around, the gathering<br>gets all lightened up! He is an integral part of the group. BC is incomplete without Raman Bhai. He gets lost just like me, carries a blank face when someone is leofying him. He is a very good singer and bhai mast gaane compose kartein hain, I remember how creative he was when we were writing songs on our friends, especially "Ooo Chiku tu aisa kyun hai ...."<br>Raman Bhai jyada nahin pite but jab bhi peete hain.. one bottle is enough to get him tight <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>I will never forget the time I spent with him when he was drunk, be it the Farewell treat<br>to our seniors or Felicity'08.  He is a great guy to hang around with, whenever he is with you there will always be moments which will bring a smile on your face. You are a great friend bhai. All the best for your MS, I know you will complete it in five years. All the best for all your future endeavors!<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I<br><br>Harshi and Me, we were more or less an acquaintance in first two years. But after four years, she is one of my closest buddy. For the first two years I remember her as a good singer, extremely kiddish. I have seen her and Harsh fighting like kids. I knew she never thought much before speaking, she would say something which would prompt me to nudge her. Third year, Ma'am would fight like cats and dogs over house points, complain that juniors are not working, complain for asking her to sing every time. In fourth year, she had a sudden realization that she needs to reduce weight and that was the time when we started walking and talking together. She is a gossip queen, I have no idea why she is so much bothered about what is happening with others. She just needs a small twick and the next moment you can find her pestering you to tell her what happened. She would not leave you until you tell her the whole story. She is damn gregarious, she would talk to anyone in the campus. At times, she has got into trouble because of her "ohh! everyone is my friend" nature. For the people, she is extremely talented, phodu singer, good in dancing, awesome mimic, damn she can mimic my laughing style!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>Aah! suprisingly sometimes, she is good at giving advices. I must admit she is by far the best singer I have come across. Still remember me<br>cheering her during her Oktober flakes performance. She was simply awesome when she sung "Animal Instinct". I love when she gets angry after she finds out that I smoked, though trust me I have reduced. Our chat begins with a standard question "aaj kitne ciggs piye?". She likes to be pampered. Our most of the interactions consists of me scolding her over any damn thing. She has gone through such a metamorphosis; Ma'am has improved her dressing sense, ab patli bhi ho gayi hain. Though, she can get on your nerves asking you repeatedly "How am I looking?".This poor soul has been victim of many of my random philosophical discussions. I am going to miss all the long walks we had, its hard to be in bad mood when she is with you because she is always upto something, uses me as a punching bag. And when I say long walks I really mean it, she never gets tired and if I tell her to sit somewhere she is like "No, I did not go for jogging today!" The best part is she is not a complicated person, she is quite open about her opinion about people, she will let you know if she is angry and it doesn't take much to cheer her up "ek do senti dialogues" will do, she is "exorbitantly" caring, needs an update of everything I am upto. I have spent some really memorable moments with her.<br><br>Some Memories, your arbit PJs,"Bada banda hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />", our discussions on some weirdest topics, your irritating tantrums, your independence day<br>performance, "the great pav bhaji treat", all my funda sessions and unending walks. <br>Harshi, you have been a great friend,enjoyed every moment spent with you and I know you will always be there for me, same caring and cute Harshi.<br>Jaldi se MS complete kar lena...<br>Cheers!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I<br><br>Meri pyari Prashu<br>Its really difficult to write a testimonial which can match four orkut testimonials and a big testimonial in the yearbook. Chalo shuru kartein hain... I still remember our first interaction, it was during the Freshers second round, When a girl in blue suit came to me and gave me a compliment on my performance. It was a beginning of an eternal friendship <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. It did not take much time for us to know each other. We spent some quality time doing BC in the first sem. It was<br>then when she had her first night out in the college. First sem we were friends who enjoyed each others company but were not very close. The whole of first sem went in making fun of each other, doing all kiddish stuffs. I still remember the visit to Shilparamam when I accidentally pushed Chuchu off the swing and then series of BC sessions we had over it. The whole "Thumpa" incident. In the first year Prashu, was sidha sadha bachcha types. I still remember making fun of the "village" she came from <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. She stressed on words when she spoke. Started most of her sentences with "Basically blah blah blah". She never studied but managed to get marks. I remember, the number of Milkybar Choo we ate just after the lunch. First sem was all "Happy" types. Then when the first year ended and she was leaving the college she was almost in tears and I was totally numb, it was this period when we realised that we have become really close friends.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>She is been a true friend. Whenever she found me sad , she would run behind me , constantly pester me for like three four hours , asking what happened and dig till I let myself out. I still remember when like after four five hours of long walk I told her what the matter was. I have improved on this, now I don't make her go through this pain stricken process. I have shared almost every bit of my life with her and still she feels then I hide things from her. She is damn possessive about her friends. We both had awesome fun in the Vizag trip. I forgot I always used to help her cross the road , but abhi bachchi badi ho gayi hai. One day, she asked me that no one has ever proposed her, so like a true friend I proposed her <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> though she ditched me later <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part III<br><br>I have already said this, she hardly studies, I remember we had our OS endsems and I was well prepared (That was the time jab main endsems phodta tha!), she called me at 1 am and was totally nervous, she had not prepared for the exam and was not feeling like studying. We went for a walk and I was giving her a brief introduction of chapters, next morning Ma'am studied and got highest in endsems. Its like some people have to get an A in every subject. She has mastered the way of writing the exams. She has been the sportswoman of IIIT-H.  I have always been in the crowd cheering her to win. I still remember how upset she was when she lost in 100m, though one Munnabhai style hug did cheer her up. She doesn't like to lose. I have seen her getting irritated even when she scored less in any paper.<br>Situations changed a bit after second year, but we were same old friends. After second year we did not meet regularly like before but apart from this nothing changed. Whenever we met we started from the day we left our conversation. Yes, at times we throw tantrums at each other,she claiming that I am always busy with Parliament and me claiming that she has other people to mamange <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We have had BC on every possible topic. This lady has a very strong pair of legs. If you make fun of her, try to pull her leg<br>then your going to get it really hard. Prashu is a very understanding and caring friend and its because of this that many people see a very good friend in her. She is a patient listener and shows maturity when thinking about others problem. She has been an ear to many sad souls, but interestingly she is always in dilemma about her own life, from the first year I have been predicting things about her. Prashu can never keep her anger for long, she carries a dead face when she is angry. Its easy to cheer her up when she is in a bad mood, an orange candy or a chaat will do. She loves bikes. Whenever she is sad or upset we go for long bike rides. Prashu, worked a lot for Felicity'08. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part IV<br>We have had endless fun, from watching movies to eating out, long walks ... this list is endless.<br>he is very stable and very determined. I still remember her getting shorlisted for Google Woman<br>award and her reaction when she did not win it. She is damn good in giving advices. She has<br>helped me out in "n" number of occasions. She likes to dance and I feel guilty for never encouraging her to dance. But, we never miss an oppurtunity to dance together during DJ nights.<br>She is damn caring, she has given me some of the best gifts on my Birthday and all hand made. I took her pen which she considered as a lucky charm. I still remember, I forgot her Birthday and the scolding I got after that. She is pretty intelligent, was the first one to be placed in the batch and she did not leave for home till all her good friends got placed. Prashu has become almost a part of our group, many times it happens we forget that we have a lady besides us and get into or normal vulgar BC sessions.Prashu has very different qualities unlike many girls, she is very self dependent, I have hardly seen her breaking down even in very distressing situations, most of the times she is calm<br>and composed. Right from the first year she has always been there for me.<br><br>Some Mermories- our endless discussions on random topics, the whole of second year, all your<br>sports events, you lifting the sports-woman cup(and carrying the torch the next year), all<br>the night outs, bike rides, movies we watched together, DJ nights, Vizag trip, all the BC on<br>your future life, always cursing you for ditching me, all my funda sessions on things you need to improve, your tantrums. Anyways we both are placed in the same city so will not have this feeling of missing her after the college. The amount of help and support she has given me is unparalled and "I owe a lot to you lady!"<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deeps<br>The relationship I have with this girl is of "respect". I have great respect for her. In the first year, I remember how much bothered she was about studies. Interestingly we had almost the same CG in the first year, but Ma'am then<br>crossed all bars, she is among the batch toppers now. This lady can go on working. I don't remember how many night out she had working in the lab. She and Maruti, showed me there R&D project looked phodu with graphics of Charminar<br>"but aage ka kuch samajh mein nahin aaya <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". One thing we share in common is love for Coffee, we would bump into each other at the coffee shop and ask each other "aaj ki kaun si hai?". My first year discussions with her always ended with "kitni aachi hai tu".<br>With her it has been different, we are not jigri dost types but whenever we have met we have talked like best friends. In the second year, we had a bad patch but things change for the<br>good. That was the time I felt, she trusted people easily and she was vulnerable. She has changed and changed for the good. For the later half of our college life we have maintained the same equation. She speaks in a hyderabadi accent <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, we have talked about all arbit stuffs,<br>some really nasty <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Aah! she is proud of her Jim Morrison hairstyle. Great at cracking some pathetic PJs <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I will cherish all the BC<br>we had on random stuffs. The quality that I really admire in her is of "compassion". Feeling of compassion is rare to find in people. She is very caring, not just for her friends but also for people she doesn't know. Her dedication<br>towards her work is well known. "The initiative you have taken is commendable". The type of work she is doing now is unbelievable.<br>I bow to you!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Pappu/Paps/Pappy<br>goo goo ga gaa goo goo<br>Now this one will be difficult to write. It might sound stupiotic but I have always treated him like a three years old kid. Be it getting chocolates for him or cuddling him. I know you like getting this special lill attention. People around get irritated seeing me man handling<br>Pappu. For the people, he is cutest guy in the batch, phodu dancer , phodu bowler, decent orator, phodu in mathematics. feel that he is upto something! but apne liye he is a small kid.<br>First year, for first couple of days I did not like him because his face resembled someone I hated. But we used to meet during our ragging sessions and started talking then. We had endless nightouts dancing on "Kajra Re", creating our versions of Mahabarat, abusing each other with filthy words during ragging. He was very different<br>in first year, he was here just to have fun. He told me and many of us that if we are ragged now then the seniors will help us later(nothing of that sort ever happened <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) And then came the freshers nite, we both were there in the final four. I have to admit that he was the favourite. I was asked the first question and I screwed it, then came our superstar pappu, this guy screwed his answer royally. He had guts to go infront of five hundered strong crowd and tell our seniors that he would like to rag them! After the freshers, it was time for our seniors to get it back. But the ragging episode was fun. We enjoyed our arse out! For the whole of first year he was never the acads types. Always used to run here and there for codes and assignments. Back in first year, he was a pathetic coder. Paps is among the few who got "D" in ITWS I.  After our first year, he had this sudden realization that he should study. How can I forget the walk where he was questioning himself why didn't he study <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and said he would be serious about acads from second year.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I- contd<br><br>Second year was different, he reduced his fun quota, Paps alloted some time to acads and it was not fruitless. He topped our OS midsems. We acknowledged him with the title of Baba Pagare. This was one hilarious episode. We used to have bhakti sessions for him. Were we had Chop suey and SOD tracks as our bhajan. How can I forget<br>Banga and Ojasvi were staunch followers of Baba Pagare Nath , they never missed a Bhakti session.<br>His and Chika's room NBH 47 was our favourite hangout point. We have had endless BC in that room. around fifteen of us all cramped in that room and leofying each other. First two years<br>he has never left an oppurtunity to pull my leg. I used to come to his room after my walks<br>and he and chika would pounce on me with thousands of questions and saracstic comments.<br>In second year we had some interesting incidents like the July 12th episode. He was so crocked<br>up that day. Series of funny incidents happened that day. I have infinite unforgetable memories<br>with this guy.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II<br><br>He is the one who introduced many of us to booze. We had many memorable Boozing-BC moments.<br>Be it the NBH hostels and then OBH or Club 8. Me, Bhalu, Adi and him we four were always there<br>guttling down bottles and trapping newbies to share their secrets. He has given most of the nicks in our group but I take the credit for the nick "Pappu". He was my BTP partner and he completed his part in just two hours <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>He rarely gets passionate about things. But if he does then he goes crazy about it. You should see his zeal for dance, he has made over hundered plans to learn Salsa but never executed it. His work in Felicity'08 is commendable, how can I forget when he got the first sponsor Greenspace how upbeat we all were. Felicity was the time when I got to see serious side of him.<br>He was so damn passionate about the fest. He has a great rapport with all the batches right from juniors to our seniors. But very few people know that he is very good when it comes to reciting kindergarden poems. His favourite being "twinkle twinkle little star". Bhai, has a peculiar "kaaminewaala" smile and when he gives this smile we all know he is upto something. Tenderhearted, I remember his reaction when he saw a puppy being curshed to death by a lorry, he was mum for one whole day and when he rushed and called me to help a lill bird who had fallen from its nest, when he called everyone to help a trapped kitten!<br>Good at faking emotions, this motherfucker knows how to use his cuteness, if he needs to get a work done from us, he would make a puppy face. He uses this a lot, one innocent "what harm can I cause" look and we all would agree to his demands, be it going to a restaurant or to accompany him to buy some "Bhopali" medicines!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part III<br><br>For pappu friends are his world. He is my strength because I know if anything goes wrong<br>I will have atleast one person who will have full trust in me. We never had fights, even if we had<br>it never lasted more than a minute. It feels great to know a person in and out. When he tells you each and every bit of his life, it makes you feels so special. Pappu has done a lot for all of us, He can't see anyone of us sad. After zillion of people claiming how complicated a person I am,<br>he is among the very few who knows what is going in my mind, knows when I am irritated. He would come to my room, place himself comfortably in my room and ask me "kya ho gaya ?" Ego never comes in between good friends and it never did. Our friendship grew and now feels like we are a part of a family. Its difficult to imagine a friendship which has only sweet memories to cherish and I feel blessed to have him. Over the years he has changed for the better, for a person who gets influenced by his friend circle, for someone who depends a lot on his friends things can get bitter at times and it did! Yes, he gets less personal now, speaks less about his feelings but he is the same old chap who cares about every damn soul in this world!<br>When I was in Mumbai, we used to talk everyday, he would tell about the girls he was flirting with, the movies he saw, complain about not calling. Its easy to tell if he is angry, he would carry his anger like a three year old kid<br>and he just needs a little twick to get his heart out! The sweetest thing about aapna Pappu is<br>he is not complicated unlike most of us. He doesn't think much about things which do not concern his little world. Now, we will not be living in the same city but it doesn't really matter because I know I will always have<br>this little kid running behind my arse! Though it will be difficult after I get committed, its difficult to manage a girl and a kid at the same time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nammu!<br>It has been quite a journey with this girl. We were great friends in the second year, then some misunderstandings and abhi "sabh kuch normal <img src=Smileys/1.gif />"<br>She is very smart, you can  talk to her about anything, right from Movies,Football to Politics. Huge fan of WWE and HBK. She is a damn good orator. We both were there in the A2 batch. And her speaking abilities were amazing.<br>She is one of the best dancer in the batch and I remember your MnM performance <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.  She is one of the best bloggers in the batch, did I mention "her writing skills are amazing!". Like any other girl she is damn worried about her looks and figure <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, don't worry lady you have become thin, almost on your way to achieve perfect figure, ab khush. She is a "Female Chauvinist", we have had endless dicussions on this topic.<br>I remember, our CBIT fest trip and the fun we had together, all your school friends talks, your special gang "forgot the name<img src=Smileys/10.gif />" and how<br>snobbish your gang was. I remember, the Dumb C session we had had just before the main house event were we kept enacting movies. Lady gets bored when I get into Funda pelofying avatar.<br>She has changed a lot in these four years.<br>Back then in second year, I felt she was living in a protective shell and she never wanted to come out of it and now I see a very different<br>girl, self dependent and independent. I see her as a smart composed lady who has over the years learned to deal with situations, truly <br>commendable <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>We have spent some amazing time together,It feels nice to have a friend like you!<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Again a testimonail from BigB<br>She is cute , bubbly, chirpy. She has a squeaking voice. I fondly call her Chuchu, has an intersting etymology. I had a great time with her in the first year. The whole "Chand Chand Chand..." thing was damn hilarious.<br>She is damn intelligent. Phodu in acads! Waah.. ma'am bhi gazab hai ... bina jyada pade CAT phod diya and interview ke liye nain gayi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>She perhaps has the best resume in the batch, among the batch toppers, TA for all the major courses list is endless. And finally she is in Google.<br>I remember how unsatisfied she was after her first sem performance and she showed her determination in the following sems.<br>I had some really memorable experiences with her, "when I accidently pushed you off the swing<br>in Shilparamam, when you were cheering me up in the Bus because I was angry with you, making fun of your pony tail, disturbing you in the class,the Rakhi time and the long walks we had,the fun we had in Felicity'07, the Rangoli we made together in the recent felicity and won a consolation prize". Chuchu has set goals and she is very dedicated. She likes to try things and explore new domains, she is a good dancer, very creative. We were in the same english group and I was amazed how she used to poetically write<br>things. <br>She was brilliant in the Felicity, she managed threads pretty well and how can I forget rally against Global Warming, fab work. I will remember all the scolding sessions, I have scolded her over little things and then we used to make up for it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I remember our recent chat during placement, it was truly amazing! We were discussing "what will we do if we are not placed".<br>We have seldom talked after second year, but we have a special bond.<br><br>You will always be special to me!<br><br>All the best aage ke liye...<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is among my first friends in IIIT.<br>We did not talk much after second year.Major reason being we stayed in different hostels in the third year. But, whenever we met we made sure to talk our heart out. I remember my first meeting with him in cellar, he was<br>among the first rankers in our batch, he talked how strong he was in chemistry and how he raped Fiitjee tests. We both were in the same English<br>group and he was so sincere back then. He was very different in first year and went through a "Jassi jaise koi nahin hai" makeover later.<br><br>We had some intersting BC sessions mainly concentrating on life and some arbit philosophies. He is a great person to talk to and<br>you can talk to him about any random stuff.He has this "never say die attitude". He doesn't believe in artificiality. He would be good to you if he likes you or he wouldn't give a damn! He is the cassanova of our batch <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Popular with girls and bhai isse flaunt bhi karte hain and I hope he remembers my chat with him during the recent club 8 visit. He worked a lot for Felicity, especially in hospitality. I remember him running behind all<br>the organizers to get the names of the judges to arrange cabs for them. He is god in all the HSSMs, I owe my Globalization grade to him. From globalization I remember how kiddish he can get at times. I remember he was giving a presentaion in Globala and he fired all those who asked questions to him and was angry over other groups for delaying their presentation. He is very public about his personal life. Half of the time his status message has to do something with his life. He is a movie buff and is known to set the toughest movie quizes(which are easy according to his standards). An avid reader and phodu in Angrezi but interestingly he still has a touch of Haryanvi in his accent. He is full of energy and totally restless. <br>I will remember all the BC of second year, Felicity'08, all the philosophical discussions with you, your fucking tough movie quiz and the recent club 8 trip.<br>Ab Bangalore mein masti...<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>We are not great friends. But at times you feel that there are some people with whom you share a special bond and he is one of them. I never felt as if I don't know this guy.<br>Sachin is very composed. Bhaiya ji cool ka tag carry kartien hain....He has a weird gait which earned him the name KK. He is a total movie freak,<br>Has watched all the movies in DC.He is damn lazy, you can always find him lazing in his den.<br>He claims that he has "ego". But he is the same guy who cares a lot for his friends. He can go to any extent to help his friends. He has always been very supportive to me; be that any decision regarding the batch, I know he will always be there.<br>We had our share of moments, I still remember during the placement time when I would go to his wing and complete a whole packet of ciggs<br>and irritate him with my stupid points and arguments. This asshole is damn good at leofying people. He is one of the best coders, still remember how irritated he was when he got a code wrong in first years; still cries for getting a B in DS. Never saw him with books, but wants to get an eight CG <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It wasn't a surprise when he got placed in Citrix. Tough he always claims<br>that he was lucky; motherfucker you deserved it! He is pure at heart, I can never forget the discussion we had on the third day of Felicity'08.<br><br>Some Memories- our short booze sessions, recent pillion ride, placement season chats on "why didn't we start interacting earlier", "tum saale kabhi room nahin aate <img src=Smileys/10.gif />".<br>Now we both are placed in the same city and it feels great to have a friend like you<br>around.<br>Cheers!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Final chapter:<br>Memorable moments, In first year we had an argument over some stuff and I threw my watch in anger and I shouted at him. I was very guilty of being so rude. And after an hour when we clarified the things we both were almost in tears and hugged each other(Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham style!). The second one, when we had this fight over some name thingy during euity pulse , again we had a serious argument and then I mailed him rather then talking to him personally and he mailed me back. We were doing all this sitting infront of the lappies opposite to each other!   When all of a sudden we both decided to complete a Graphics assignment and had a night out coding and laughing at each others output. And all those pillion rides on my bike , when we cursed each other for not having a Girlfriend whenever we crossed a romantic secluded road! and finally all the endless BCs we have had. He has been one of my strongest critics.He made me realize what were my strength and weaknesses. Got to learn a lot from him. Never say die attitude, determination and hardwork. He is heavily responible for me still maintaining a decent CG <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Finally this guy loves Maths, he wanted to do Phd in Mathematics(Hope you will do it someday!). All the very best bhai! Do not leave your "Jaat" killer instinct and stop slapping me for no reason!<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>-still looks incomplete to me, shall write more soon!- <br><br>Cheers!<br>This testimonial still looks incomplete... will update it soon!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>chapter 2:<br><br>A kid at heart, he would come to my room and when he realizes that I am working on something important he would ask me to say "Sorry" otherwise he would switch off the computer! He would secretly dance on the songs of Hrithik Roshan and SRK and would give a seepish smile when caught! He would slap me on my face for no reason, and when asked why did he do that he would reply "aise hi". Aah! Me , him and Himank we have had endless BC sessions and the best part is when we irritate our other early to bed wingies Vipul and Maroo. He gets irritated very easily and when he starts punching you for no reason, you know that he is irritated. He has very strong fundas about life, interesting to listen at times. He is the only one in the group who has never touched alcohol or ciggs(We admire you for that!) though he always has reddened eyes, gives you a feeling as if he is always drunk. We started listening to rock together, thanks to Adi and Pappu. After the class we would play Nirvana in full volume. Remember when we had some guys complaining that the loudness was disturbing a movie shooting in Gachibowli stadium.<br>He doesn't open up easily, but ones you get him out of his shell you will realise how innocent this guy is,oblivious of many things happening around him. I have always treated him like a younger brother, Be it fighting to get a room for him near mine or shouting at him when I am not in my best of moods. As stupid as , going for shopping to get a t-shirt for him, man! one day he tried all the t-shirts of his size available in the showroom but none fit him.  Finally we managed to get one of his size, phew!<br><br>(-contd-)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Chapter1:<br>Chhotu/JAAT<br>On the first day in IIIT, I was searching for a room partner and then I bumped into this guy. I came to know that he was from Hissar(Place where I lived a few years back) and we decided to be roommates. First look, you could say that he was shy and an introvert. He had this funny Haryanvi accent especially when he pronounced the "O" syllable. He was very sincere, regularly attended classes, made notes, he felt that he should work hard as he was one of the last rankers in AIEEE(some early misconceptions!) When I used to come my room after my ragging routine I could find this guy studying. I remember, when we were done with our Physics end sems this guy literally cried , we all were busy consoling him and when the results were out he topped the batch in physics, he topped in first year. He participated in Hindi Debate and won it. <br>Two years later, this guy had totally lost his Haryanvi accent, he knew even if he does not study he could end up getting an A in any subject.Did I say before that he was an introvert and shy. I later realized how wrong I was. Man! his dedication and confidence is worth admiring.<br>The best part is, he wants to improve in everything. Never considers himself to be best in anything. You should see him working out in Gym, I can confidently say that he has the most strenuous routine among all of us( I can see your grin boy!). He started playing TT  and now he is one of the best in the batch. After placements, tried his hand in gaming, played FIFA and now you should see him playing. Never likes to lose, something that is so strong in him.  You should see how happy he gets when he wins a match against Mahavir or Khatri! He told me "Chand I want to get an internship in Microsoft google sunn ke maaza nahin aata" and he ended up getting into Microsoft. One of the sharpest brains I have seen in my life. He has played a major role in all of us getting placed. I used to call him "cracktheinterview". This guy knew all the questions available in the Net!<br><br>(-contd-) </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Energy Bomb. DJ ranga is the easiest one to sketch  take a small ball and keep it keep it over a big ball and there you go .. DJ Ranga for you! Any event , any get together any wing<br>any damn place you can find this guy jumping and smiling. His instant shot to fame was<br>his act in Radio Mirchi 'idi chaala hot guru'! Recent performances include 'Masakali' in Felicity '09 and some breathtaking dance performances as a part of the crowd. Undoubtedly he is the biggest database of Hindi Songs and has a peculiar way of singing them... 'the Ranga Style'. I remember we were having a serious talk about how people change over the years and Ranga replies 'Chand Bhai I have changed a lot from first year but Nobody believes me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />'. This guy is irritated of being typecasted as a cutie<br>by the girls! I hope you find your 'ringa' soon. You rock Range... Cheers!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
