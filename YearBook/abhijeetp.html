<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hey Muscular, hey popular, spectacular, he's a bachelor. Yup, He's pappu.<br><br>The nanha munha looking guy but very smart. An awesome dancer and an awesome BC baaz. A Bhopali who is always trying to come up with some new slang which would bring a big smile on everyone's face.<br><br>I didn;t know him well for the first 2 years, but came closer to him from 3rd year onwards. He's such a nice guy to be with. He has an aaahsome sense of humour and a big collection of <b>dash</b> songs in his PC. He was the one who introduced me to hunny singh and all. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>A very emotional guy who thinks directly from the heart. He's the one who made a drink for everyone, literally everyone on this floor. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> after the Felicity 3rd day. Also, it was pappu who asked me to play <b> yaaron </b> during the DJ night because of which almost a 60 people came and stood arms in arms singing their hearts out. I must say, that was the best moment of BTech life. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Baaki pappu can dance sala. Kabhi kabhi aditi was awesome. And I've also seen him performing on Jai Ho! many a times in his room. Bilkul Dev Patel ki tarah hi lagta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Cricket bhi awesome khelta hai. Bahut dedicasion hai bande me cricket ke liye. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> aur itna sab karte hue padhai bhi bahut ache se karta hai. Bhai main the kehta hun ki bhai saari fields me active rehkar banda meri nazron me ek complete allrounder ban chuka hai. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Aise hi khush rehna..haste hasaate rehna. Will miss u a  lot <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>Love,<br>DJ Ranga. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is cute, sweet, unpredictable ...<br>Abe teri testi mein araam se likh kar orkut pe daal doongi...abhi badi testi nahin likh sakti <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>All the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Pagare aka Pappu aka Bhopali</u><br><br>As far back as I can remember, he has always been called Pagare, which has recntly changed to Pappu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One of the most famous and dynamic guys of the batch. This Bhopali has always been the star of our batch, ranging from the seniors to the super seniors to the juniors and super juniors, he must be one of the most popular guys of the batch when it comes to people from other batches, each and everybody in the college knows this stud. An awesome dancer, Best bowler in IIIT (the guy represented MP long long time ago). An self confessed introvert and fattu when it comes to talking to girls, he has imporved quite dramatically as the years have progressed, from being a guy who was shy even to say an <b>Excuse Me</b>, right now he has lot of (girl) friends and some special friends. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Has an unusual capacity for BC, always ready for a session or two <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> which resulted in his ( and Cheeka's) room, the famous Room Number <b>47</b> becoming the BC hub for our group. It was a meeting place for us cellarites, ppl from 1st floor and Maroo (2nd floor). The number of hillarious, emotional, memorable moments we had in that room is just uncountable. That was and will always be remembered as the <b>BC room </b>of our group. Infinite amount of BC has happened in that 10X10 tract of land in NBH. Oh! those lovely memories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>He is the cute kid of our group, a concept developed and popularized by Chand. His performances of <b>Twinkle twinkle and Machhli jal ki rani</b> count as one of the most hilarious things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Has to suffer all the <b>puchhi</b> sessions. I am amazed as to how he handles those sessions by Chand, when even I as an overlooker get frustrated <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> the only reason which I can think of is, he also likes the puchhi sessions <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>One incident of him which I would never be able to forget is the fa**ing incident in Vipul's room, the torture that we had to bear that day is almost incomparable and to add more misery to it, this thing happened twice. Our whole wing was smelling so bad for some time that even I sitting 2 rooms away from the spot of action couldnt bear the trauma. I dunno how Vipul bore the hardship.<br><br>I will be forever grateful to the guy for introducing us to the wonderful thing called <b>Booze</b>, he was the real booze master of our group who slowly made all of us his allies, leaving just Manish as the non bewda amongst us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We have had few of the most memorable moments boozing away to glory in NBH, when he would come up with all sort of games and lists (some of them quite embarassing) after being talli. He was our official bartender making all our drinks whenever we had anything to drink in our rooms. Will sorely miss this guy when we have booze sessions now on. From being the pioneer of boozing, he has become an infrequent drinker these days, giving such sessions a miss quite a few times.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>There is more to his creative side than the dancing talent about which almost everybody knows in the college. He is also a poet par excellence, would love to quote one of the lines written by him here <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> :<br><b><i>"Today I sit waiting for a kiss<br>Oh, am I that pissed"</i></b><br><br>I cant even try to express the enjoyment I had when I saw this couplet written in one of his notebooks, and to date he still doesnt admit that this is his own creation, Modesty I will say.<br><br>He has always (until quite recently) been my frustu partner, both of us would have lengthy discourses sharing our frustrations on being still single and would keep looking for reasons why we were still single (and ready to mingle <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We always cursed others in our group because they wouldnt get frustrated over the lack of THE girl in their lives. Almost all the booze parties until our 3rd year or so would solely concentrate on the topic of girls. Ofcourse rest of the people got bored by then and banned this topic from booze conversations. Most memorable of our frustu talks would be the one we had on the eve of Mathur's bday when we went to Suraj, that was the time when I divulged THE secret to him, since then our friendship has reached a different dimension. I will always remember all the times when I used to go to his room when I was frustrated and wanted to talk about our fav topic <b>"Girls in our lives"</b> and we would both console each other and advise the other on the things that the other should do to relieve himself of the domain of singledom.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>And ofcourse how can I ever forget the great <b>Cold War</b>, we had in our 3rd and 4th semesters <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All of a sudden he just stopped talking to me for reasons unknown to me, leaving me puzzled as to what could have been the cause of such a behaviour, and the dumbass that he was, he never told me that he was angry with me for such and such things. Gotta say that it was the lowest trough in our relation. I almost started hating him that time to the extent that it wasnt possible for both of us to even study in a group.It was only sometime in 4th sem when Maroo, Chand and others intervened to sort out our differences that I came to know the reason for his anger. Thankfully that trough was overcome and we became friends again. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The coding session we had in the teaching lab 210 would be one that I wont forget easily, that one particular chat must have lifted my morale more than many other achievements I have had all these years. Back in 1st year, I used to do my C assignments on the first day itself and gained some reputation for it. This guy was quite impressed with my coding prowesss, so this happened that both of us were sitting on adjacent systems and the guy started praising me and praise he did. He just kept saying that you are this, you are that, blah blah. He went on to say that I shouldnt have been here in IIIT instead I deserved IIT-Bombay. Gotta say that <b>fool ke kuppa</b> hona would be an understatement to describe my state at that time. Never in my life have I been praised this much. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Will always remember that convo we had that time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 5]</b><br><br>He has always been one person who I always wanted to have as one of my closest friend, I dunno what it was in him that made me feel so, may be the childish innocence, the jovial nature, the BC he did. In the first 3 years,we were friends, quite good friends but not the close friends that I always wanted us to be, thankfully in the 4th year, our tie became stronger and right now I would rate him among my closest friends in college, and I am glad to know that he also considers me as a close enough friend.<br><br>There are so many things which I dont seem to remember right now, after all writing out 4 years in some thousands of words is a very difficult task and you cant expect anybody to succeed in the attempt (specially when there is a deadline approaching) and although I might have failed miserably but I know that you will always know what you mean to me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He perhaps must be one person who has changed the most during the course of his B.Tech, I dunno whether its been for good or bad coz I wasnt much of a friend of his in the initial phase.One very important thing about him is, he values his friends too high (like me), which has been a source of major disappointments and hurt for him in the beginning, but nowadays he has started taking things in his stride which is quite good  coz the people he meets in his life can't  be as good as him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>You gotta fucking stay in touch or else I will come down to Pune and frigging kill you. and remember the reliance mobiles which we have to buy. Would have loved if you were also in Hyderabad but as some wise man has said <b>Jo Hota hai achhe ke liye hota hai</b>. Lets see what good comes out of this<br><br><b>Most memorable moment : The outing we had on Mathur's bday and the time we went to Medchal at 1 am in the night<br>Song for you : Sookar Mere Man ko <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> </b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking.. as your email id suggests <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> With lotsa love!! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Pappu paas ho gayaa... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I have met this guy only a few times but when, during a conversation I told him I have lived in Bhopal and studied in Campion School, he was interested because he is a Campionite. Campion being a great school I can clearly see why Abhijeet is such a phodu guy.<br>I still remember his dance on the freshers, breath taking... wonderful !! <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I wish you get your 6 packs asap. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for the future, I'm sure it'll be better although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>PART 1</b><br>"Let's go to a doctor tomorrow and find out what limit of alcohol is OK for us. Then we need not tell our parents because there is nothing wrong about having it in limits." <br><br>This is what two big time boozers decided after we had a bottle of beer two years back (Incidentally, it was my first). Of course, he has now become rather sober while I am still going strong. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It's ironic since he had been the one to introduce many of us to boozing; I being one of them. Back then during the summer months of 2007, we had those countless and amazing booze sessions. From my first day, I rather developed a strong liking for it. Those days, if he or I ever wanted to have a session, we did not even to say a word, just looking at each other's faces around 9 or 10PM was enough to convince the other. During one of the grand booze parties, Pagare said <i>Main Jeet Gaya Kya</i> in excitement and disbelief. Well, I can't give here the reference but that night forms one of the best memories I have from those days. : ) Now Club 8 has replaced NBH 148 as the venue and he is generally reluctant to join. Thus, those days can never come back.  <br><br>Alcohol can be said to be one of the foundations of our close friendship, the other being the love for rock and metal. Pagare and I shared this this passion for listening rock music of all forms. From Doors to Metallica and LedZep to Pantera, we adored them all. Megadeth was a shared favorite. It started right in the 3rd sem and moved on. Whenever one of us would have discovered something new, it would be made known to the other. In the 3rd year, we used to attend every gig happening in the city. Escape became one of our most frequented and favorite hangout places. One day, we were so desperate that we went to a gig while it was raining throughout. However, being all soaked up did not stop us from head-banging and enjoying the gig to its fullest. We being slim and sane humans, were always hesitant to join the brutal moshing those HRL monsters used to do.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>PART 2</b><br><br>However, during one of the gigs at OFD, he mustered enough courage to go into the pit and called me from the other side of the pit. Bam! We hit each other. That was followed by the monsters falling over us and me receiving a whale of a push by Sairam, the biggest of them all. This incident will always rest in my mind as a fond memory.<br><br>Riders on the Storm would see us working so passionately for the cause of rock. Scouting for organizers and bands to play was fun. Memories of the gig will always remain intact in my mind. <br><br>During Felicity 09, we briefly turned businessmen as well. I Chirag and Pagare sat down scratching our head to come upon a business idea to present in Bizwit. The first session was extremely funny and we had a good time laughing at each other's silly ideas. However, we came with an idea (secret <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). I drafted it and send our entry - <b>Dial-a-Delivery<b>. Much to our disbelief, we got selected for the finals. I got busy and could not get the time to make the PPT. Pagare took up the job and the resulting PPT had no theme what-so-ever <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We reached the venue to present our idea rather unprepared. I was in a casual tee and some of the other participants were in handsome suits. I was hesitating to go ahead but Pagare took the 2nd slot with confidence. The simplicity and practicality of our idea stuck a chord with the judges - one a Dean at ISB and other - CEO of a startup. We bagged the 3rd prize beating our seniors who had one the last year. I was extremely delighted at the result. Btw, he still owes me and Chirag the party from the prize money. Maybe, we will start a business together one day. Who knows!<br><br>Our initial interaction was due to him being Chirag's roommate. During the initial period, I thought he was of the stud kinds considering his performances on the Freshers day and ragging time. That made him unappealing for a while but after sometime, I realized that he was different what I had initially perceived. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>PART 3</b><br><br>Pagare is a great person to be friends with.  His company was entertaining. I remember the pep talk he gave me when I had screwed up my grades in the 3rd sem and was being silly by thinking of not going home in the vacations. That really lifted me up. His prowess in convincing others was unbeatable. He could make you do the silliest and boldest of things. <br><br>He has gradually changed from what he was in the first two years. Back then he was this candid guy who always spoke his heart. He was someone who would never hide his frustrations and thus became one of the first to earn the <i>Frustoo</i> tag. However, starting 3rd year he has been making a conscious effort to become more mature. Sadly, that means less booze and no more BC while drinking. And who can forget his <i>Abe Yaar<i> punch line which used to make the frustrated side of others come out in open along with his. I really miss the old <i>Pagare<i> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>But they say that nothing is permanent and so it was. The Microsoft party proved to be spoilsport in the party of our friendship. Thanks to me drinking more than what was human, I blabbed like an idiot and screwed it all up. I was too intoxicated to realize that I had lost a friend - and that one of my best. I could never have imagined that we would not share a drink for the coming 5 months. It was only in January that I apologized and tried to make up. We were coming back to good terms. CRI looked like a good old 5th sem gig and surely it was the buildup to the Maiden gig we were going to attend in Bangalore the next week. His refusal to come to the Maiden gig on the next day again saw our friendship hitting a bottom. It also made me realize that nothing could the old closeness back since he had lost interest in both the cornerstones of our friendship - booze and rock. On days, I feel grim to have lost such a close friend. <br><br>Message for you: We may not be best of friends now but never forget that you would always be close to my heart.<br><br>Song for you: Riders on the storm! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Always knew him from a distance till the first year and an honest confession - always thought of him as this really cute guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> who dances well and is extremely popular but sleeps a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Knew him better in the second year when we prepared for a dance (for the dance club <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and after that got to talk to him a li'l more. Has this casual air of confidence about him which is a great quality to have. Wish I had interacted more with him but anyways here's wishing you all the best for your future and keep dancing and playing cricket!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>When I first met him, I thought he was just like me, and that we would make great friends. He was the one I wrote a description for in Mrs. Marathe's A1 class. We were the very first drinkers of the batch. Somehow never really had the chance to interact with him much, and later on I realized that we didn't have that much in common after all <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Nice guy, who comes across as one who knows what he wants from life and has his priorities set. Very sharp, too. I'll always remember you for the interactions we had in the very first and the very last segments of our B.Tech.<br><br><b>Memories:</b> Some of the drinking sessions, the one and only Sports Committee meeting.<br><b>10 years down the line I see you as:</b> A high flying, wine sipping executive with a large social circle.<br><br>Cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Pagare aka Pappu.....a typical Bhopali. He is handsome, dashing, popular, smart and of-course a lovely friend. <br><br>We became friends while playing cricket for our house. He is the best bowler :^)^ :^)^ I have played with (fortunate enough to be in his team both in inter-house and inter-batch) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But actually, I am a big fan of his batting too. He is one of the most technically correct batsman in our college <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> Also the way he handled the captaincy of our team proves his leadership skills.....extremely good. I can never forget the Eat-Street outing of our batch cricket team.....loads of fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is an awesome dancer and an ultimate BC-baaz. With his sense of humour along with quick-wittiness makes everybody laughs all the time <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Although iske saath itni BC nahi kari hai, but I still remember our placement time, when we console each other until he got placed <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>Placement se yaad aaya, we had an awesome day with our placement head, when both of us were out of our minds and were laughing on his face although Jayadev was scolding us <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Finally both of us were placed on consecutive days and were extremely happy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>When it comes to studies, he is <b>baba</b>. Extremely phodu and quick learner. Hats-off to his efforts which he put in while preparing for the placements <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  Maths mein bhi bahut tez hai.<br>Also very good at organizing and managing events. One of the person having major hand in makinf our felicity successful. He took the responsibility of the entire cultural part <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>All the best pappu for your future with <i>tinki</i> I'll miss you a lot whenever I'll play cricket.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Cricket is one thing on which we have done more BC than anything else. Have spent hours discussing shots, stats, records, players and recollecting classic matches almost everywhere, be it in NBH-47, 270s wing, TV room, mess or while walking to class. He is madly in love with this game. At times he gets some of the weirdest and wackiest ideas and even takes the initiative to implement the same. His imagination power is totally out of this world and can really make people around him go rofl <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Completely obsessed with pee-ing from different places and even tried doing the same a lot of times <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br>Friends mean a lot to this guy and is always there for them whenever they need him. Gets a lot sensitive when it comes to friends. In these four years we may not have become as close friends as I thought we should have, but koi na .. Pune hai aage ... picture abhi baki hai mere dost <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. We have had lots of coincidences like first sharing the same room, getting placed on the same day and now a job in the same city. This is what I believe means ... Friends Forever ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Loads and loads of memories to associate with him that I will cherish throughout my life. To name a few - late night BC sessions in 1st sem leofying Chand, cursing Jawahar after every assignment and lab test, imaginary fighting sequence <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, dost incident <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, infinite cricket chats, daaru sabha on 3rd night of Felicity'08, middleware aur BTP mein kaatna <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, discussing scores after aimcats and cursing Maroo and Bhalu for their exceptionally high scores, placements (first 8 days) and us getting placed together on the 9th day and many more.<br>Likhne ko to aur bhi bahut kuch hai, pages bhare ja sakte hai is bande par, lekin ab baat aisi hai ki tum bhi ja rahe ho Pune aur hum bhi aa rahe hai Pune, to aur likhne ki feel nahi aa rahi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Baki to aage bhi likhta rahunga. <br><br>All the best for your future bhai and God bless you! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Most memorable moment</b>- The Club8 outing on 20th March '09 when you and Vibhav you-know-what<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Pagare aka Pappu aka Pups. My x-roomy and one of my first friends in IIIT. When I got to know first that he is a Bhopali then only I felt ki bhai bande se apni bahut jamegi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Ab in mahashaye ke baare mein aur kya kahe , vo kisi ne sach hi kaha hai - looks can be deceptive and this suits him the best. A cute and childish fella from outside, he is one of the those whom noone would like to mess around with. Extremely good at leofying people around him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> but when someone tries to do the same with him he will reply back with double intensity in an angry tone aur lene wale ki phat leti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Ab bhai bande ke talent ke baare mein kya kahe, isme to talent bhara pada hai. A good dancer, a phodu bowler, good leadership skills (great job in Felicity'08 cult. part), a decent orator, even good at writing blogs (though hasn't given much try to it) and an absolute genius when it comes to maths <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He was sure to become Mr. Fresher had he not done the last minute stupidity on stage.<br><br>A total BCbaaz and gets the sole credit for making NBH-47 - the BC room it was. Quite good at convincing people and can change their 'yes' to 'no' or vice-versa in almost no time. Even enjoys giving nicks to people, really a master at that and solely responsible for damaging the image of some of his friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Has this really weird habit of keenly observing and judging people right from the first time he meets them and then changing his opinion about them quickly. At once instance he will praise someone with all his heart and make him a hero and and at the very next instance the same person will become a zero in his eyes if he does a slight mistake. One advice that I would like to give you is to give up this habit and stop comparing others with yourself because everyone is different and unique in their own way.   <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

In second sem we used to do a lot of BC in his room .. that was on hell of a time we spent together. But later for some reason we came apart .. but like that matter. We're still close friends.<br>All 4 years have been memorable with him. But some of the best memories are of at the time we prepared for placements. He used to come to my room and ask doubts while I used to watch friends <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. I had stickers in my room to keep studying, to concentrate .. and when I watched movies he used to point at that taaki main line par aa jau. Isne bahut bar mujhe gym jane ke liye inspire kia hai ... but aalsi as I am <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.<br>Bangalore wouldn't have been awesome without him. Every friday I used to get a call just telling me the place I had to be .. no questions asked .. and I liked that .. even though main har movie jane ke pehle bahut rota tha ki paise nahi hain ... but eventually we ended up watching every damn movie in theatre <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Buddy, you've also inspired me by the sportsman spirit you showed at various incidents in college or in our group.

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Pappu/Paps/Pappy<br>goo goo ga gaa goo goo<br>Now this one will be difficult to write. It might sound stupiotic but I have always treated him like a three years old kid. Be it getting chocolates for him or cuddling him. I know you like getting this special lill attention. People around get irritated seeing me man handling<br>Pappu. For the people, he is cutest guy in the batch, phodu dancer , phodu bowler, decent orator, phodu in mathematics. feel that he is upto something! but apne liye he is a small kid.<br>First year, for first couple of days I did not like him because his face resembled someone I hated. But we used to meet during our ragging sessions and started talking then. We had endless nightouts dancing on "Kajra Re", creating our versions of Mahabarat, abusing each other with filthy words during ragging. He was very different<br>in first year, he was here just to have fun. He told me and many of us that if we are ragged now then the seniors will help us later(nothing of that sort ever happened <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) And then came the freshers nite, we both were there in the final four. I have to admit that he was the favourite. I was asked the first question and I screwed it, then came our superstar pappu, this guy screwed his answer royally. He had guts to go infront of five hundered strong crowd and tell our seniors that he would like to rag them! After the freshers, it was time for our seniors to get it back. But the ragging episode was fun. We enjoyed our arse out! For the whole of first year he was never the acads types. Always used to run here and there for codes and assignments. Back in first year, he was a pathetic coder. Paps is among the few who got "D" in ITWS I.  After our first year, he had this sudden realization that he should study. How can I forget the walk where he was questioning himself why didn't he study <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and said he would be serious about acads from second year.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part I- contd<br><br>Second year was different, he reduced his fun quota, Paps alloted some time to acads and it was not fruitless. He topped our OS midsems. We acknowledged him with the title of Baba Pagare. This was one hilarious episode. We used to have bhakti sessions for him. Were we had Chop suey and SOD tracks as our bhajan. How can I forget<br>Banga and Ojasvi were staunch followers of Baba Pagare Nath , they never missed a Bhakti session.<br>His and Chika's room NBH 47 was our favourite hangout point. We have had endless BC in that room. around fifteen of us all cramped in that room and leofying each other. First two years<br>he has never left an oppurtunity to pull my leg. I used to come to his room after my walks<br>and he and chika would pounce on me with thousands of questions and saracstic comments.<br>In second year we had some interesting incidents like the July 12th episode. He was so crocked<br>up that day. Series of funny incidents happened that day. I have infinite unforgetable memories<br>with this guy.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>He is the one who introduced many of us to booze. We had many memorable Boozing-BC moments.<br>Be it the NBH hostels and then OBH or Club 8. Me, Bhalu, Adi and him we four were always there<br>guttling down bottles and trapping newbies to share their secrets. He has given most of the nicks in our group but I take the credit for the nick "Pappu". He was my BTP partner and he completed his part in just two hours <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>He rarely gets passionate about things. But if he does then he goes crazy about it. You should see his zeal for dance, he has made over hundered plans to learn Salsa but never executed it. His work in Felicity'08 is commendable, how can I forget when he got the first sponsor Greenspace how upbeat we all were. Felicity was the time when I got to see serious side of him.<br>He was so damn passionate about the fest. He has a great rapport with all the batches right from juniors to our seniors. But very few people know that he is very good when it comes to reciting kindergarden poems. His favourite being "twinkle twinkle little star". Bhai, has a peculiar "kaaminewaala" smile and when he gives this smile we all know he is upto something. Tenderhearted, I remember his reaction when he saw a puppy being curshed to death by a lorry, he was mum for one whole day and when he rushed and called me to help a lill bird who had fallen from its nest, when he called everyone to help a trapped kitten!<br>Good at faking emotions, this motherfucker knows how to use his cuteness, if he needs to get a work done from us, he would make a puppy face. He uses this a lot, one innocent "what harm can I cause" look and we all would agree to his demands, be it going to a restaurant or to accompany him to buy some "Bhopali" medicines!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part III<br><br>For pappu friends are his world. He is my strength because I know if anything goes wrong<br>I will have atleast one person who will have full trust in me. We never had fights, even if we had<br>it never lasted more than a minute. It feels great to know a person in and out. When he tells you each and every bit of his life, it makes you feels so special. Pappu has done a lot for all of us, He can't see anyone of us sad. After zillion of people claiming how complicated a person I am,<br>he is among the very few who knows what is going in my mind, knows when I am irritated. He would come to my room, place himself comfortably in my room and ask me "kya ho gaya ?" Ego never comes in between good friends and it never did. Our friendship grew and now feels like we are a part of a family. Its difficult to imagine a friendship which has only sweet memories to cherish and I feel blessed to have him. Over the years he has changed for the better, for a person who gets influenced by his friend circle, for someone who depends a lot on his friends things can get bitter at times and it did! Yes, he gets less personal now, speaks less about his feelings but he is the same old chap who cares about every damn soul in this world!<br>When I was in Mumbai, we used to talk everyday, he would tell about the girls he was flirting with, the movies he saw, complain about not calling. Its easy to tell if he is angry, he would carry his anger like a three year old kid<br>and he just needs a little twick to get his heart out! The sweetest thing about aapna Pappu is<br>he is not complicated unlike most of us. He doesn't think much about things which do not concern his little world. Now, we will not be living in the same city but it doesn't really matter because I know I will always have<br>this little kid running behind my arse! Though it will be difficult after I get committed, its difficult to manage a girl and a kid at the same time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 3<br>A lot of memories are associated but as I have started writing testimonials quite late, so its difficult to compile everything now .... will definitely continue it on orkut. During placements, when I heard that you became very serious and even stopped talking to people, I got really worried and thankfully, I soon got the news of your placement and was extremely happy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Abhi iski baki qualities to har ek ne describe kar hi di hain. I think I'll stop as of now but will continue some other time for sure.<br><br><br>I think I should give my views on one more thing. You want to live a bindaas life full of friends and masti which is a very good attitude. But never think at some point in life, if I could have tried this I might have been able to do that. Because I know you definitely have the potential of achieveing big in your life. So, keep one goal in mind: either that first attitude with no worries or if you go for the second one, I'm telling you that no one in this world can stop you with such an awesome brain like yours which always tries to think logically(a clear example is Mathematics <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). <br><br>May God give you all the happiness in your life.<br>Don't forget me and remain in touch.<br>Pune jakar humse duur mat chala jaiyo.

Bahar nikalkar bola, ki mujhe toilet karna hai to main ise bathroom tak le jane laga, but kamina shuru ho gaya mere maje lene - kood kood kar bolne laga "main to yahin mootunga" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We both are not really good at handling a computer. But ye banda to hadd hai, second year tak ise windows mein naya folder create karna nahi aata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Third ya fourth year mein bande ko laga ki 200 compiler par <br> khatam ho gaye hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .... wtf !! A very good dancer I must say. This guy is damn talented - good mathematician, good dancer, good leader (proof is Felicity'08), an extremely good cricketer (best bowler of IIIT) and very intelligent. He is good at algorithms as well. Jahan par bhi kuch buddhi lagane ki cheez aati hai to banda awesome perform karta hai. OS to fodu hai hi iska. Aise hi thodi na ye baba ban gaya tha jiski savari badi shaan ke saath nikali gayi thi. Jiske liye chop suey bhajan roz bajaya jata tha, jiske charno mein Banga jaisa vidvaan bhi pada rehta tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But the best memory would be taking part with him in  continuing a movie clip where we got a scene from Bruce Almighty. Ahh, what did Almighty do with us that time. Abhi tak yaad karke hasta hun. Savita and Dhi-chik Dhi-chik yaad hai na <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . One memory is that of a little fight we did (actually I did, extremely sorry for that buddy) in your room and one is of those mails for sure which we sent to each other. Also, saath saath gym jana aur body dikhane ke naye naye tarike ijaad karna <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, teri jalana when you couldn't do gymming coz of muscle catch (but I really felt bad that time), that Raman's "oye Pagare" incident outside NBH-146, your dance on stage when Shaan himself was singing there in MS party, your calling me by names Manishe, Sindhi and Goonjit (yes, I remember that as well), your habit of noticing small-2 things in people and making fun of those and volleyball of course .<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br>Pappu<br><br>First time maine jab iska naam suna tha to ise khoob galiyan di thi. Kyun? Someone told me that there is a guy who is a good competitor for Chand in race of Mr Fresher. And I was like, kaun kamina *#$#$#$ hai saala jo mere roomie se compete karega. Then slowly I got to know him as he used to come to our room for doing BC with Chand or for some reason or the other. Chand is bechare ko sone nahi deta tha aur roz iske room par kafi der tak bc karta tha. Ek din banda frustaa gaya aur room par aakar baith gaya, subah tak jaane ka naam hi nahi liya taki Chand ko sabak sikha sake. That was probably my first night-out in IIIT (though it was till 4 or 5 AM only) . Slowly, I got to know him and found out that he is a genious in Mathematics. I think he is probably the best mathematician of all those i have ever seen and whenver I see that if someone's math is really good, I feel a special respect for that person and that is one of the reasons that I have a special respect for this guy and his abilities. First year mein mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai ki iski C ke assignments mein kitni lagi rehti thi. Vaise cool rehta tha but exams mein fat leti thi. Mere room par aakar kuch na kuch naye naye questions dhoond dhoond kar lata (his source used to be Abhilash for most of the times) aur kehta ki ye exam mein aane vala hai aur hum milkar unke solutions nikalne ki try karte. Maths ka mujhe koi bhi doubt aata to main isse ya Adi se hi poochta tha. Iska room NBH-47 to hamara BC hub tha. Har baar BC vahin par hoti thi. In the first year, Marathe mam asked us to write about characteristics of some person of the class so that she could recognize him. I chose the one who had the most peculiar characteristics as far as looks, walking style etc were concerned so that I could write easily but this guy chose me and I still remember a few lines from that. It was really touching <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Thanks for that buddy.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>We met on our very first day of college. I remember it as if it was just yesterday, and yet it was a four years long day <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Abhijeet Pagare who happens to be best of my buddies is I think very sensitive and very caring. Loves dancing and listens to not only rock but almost all kind of music. His fav pass time is to hang out with his "chaddi buddy" and pull his leg or help people pull his leg <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Well he is pretty darn good at that as well, pulling legs I mean. He is one of those razor sharp kinda kids, his imaginative power can knock winds out of you. Trust me I have been the victim quite a few times. He has also done a Ph.D in giving nicknames to friends. So beware if he calls you something funny, you would be that for the rest of your life. One thing that I cant do and he can do is speaking his mind out loud, because sometimes it takes a lot of courage to do what you think is right. Its very common for people to change during college days. Our pappu is no exception to this rule. I remember very vividly that evening at canteen where he pledged that he will get a girl in next 2-3 months. We also counted the number of eligible girls in hyderabad <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Though the planned never worked out for him, but thats not the point here. He was a kid at heart back then, and now when I see him I see a much mature person. Taking decisions by striking a balance between what his mind says and what his heart speaks.  By this I does not mean that he is not the same gentle and sublime guy that he was. Just add a little self-contentness and a strong mind to that and you will begin to know him. Due to such qualities that he possess I felt I could share almost anything in this world with him. No matter how deep, dark or intimate feelings that I might have. And I have shared quite a few things with him during what I would call a very short span of time. Because I feel that I havent spend as much time with you as I want, maybe due to ill-fate of mine or circumstantial situations by which we all are gripped.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Whenever I think of him or the time spent with him, it only brings smiles and loads of smile on my face <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. This is Pagare aka Pappu for you who is always there to cheer you up. Always  he has one or the other weird and witty idea going inside his head which will atleast make you smile if not laugh <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. A true friend indeed who is always there to help you. Whenever you want to do BC, just call him and he will never let you down. Aur koi ho na ho, pappu to hoga hi. He is always eager to go home and has not missed a single chance since first year <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His life revolves around his friends and family <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Our interaction did not start on a good note. Actually I hated him a lot in first year <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He used to come to my room to talk to Raman and never talked to me. It was like I could not even bear the sight of him and so whenever he visted my room, I usually avoided him and used to go to Himank's room <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He always blames me for this but he was equally responsible and never took the initiative to talk. I was very reserved and silent type in my first year. So I was never used to  talk to anyone first from my side. One could find him always in my room sleeping or doing random BC. Sometimes I do got irritated by this and this was one of the reasons I actually wanted to change my room <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. <br><br>Be it because of his dancing, his friendly nature or ever smiling cute face, starting right from the ragging (read interaction) sessions, he has been one of the most popular guyz of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He did some stupidity on the stage on Freshers nite and that's why Chand got the title of Mr. Fresher <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> otherwise no-one could have stopped him from becoming Mr. Fresher <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> though he became Mr. Popular <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. His room NBH-47 was one of the most famous rooms because of the BC sessions held there. It was the hot spot for all the BC sessions. Though I never attended any sessions there, I heard a lot about it from Raman and Himank. I also heard that he was very famous among the fairer sex in GH <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Come second year and things started changing a bit. He topped midsem-1 in OS and got his name "Baba", though he never repeated that feat <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. No one can ever forget that "Baba ki Sawaari" from motorola to OBH and then in the OBH mess. How can one forget 12th July. You could see him crying, shouting on people and doing some crazy things out on the road from NBH to OBH <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Such a behaviour was very new to me because it was the first time I encountered a drunkard <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>When we shifted to OBH, we actually started talking and had some awesome BC. In NBH, his room was the BC room but here in OBH mine was the one and sometimes I really got pissed off with this. I like my room to be very tidy and clean and usually after some BC session is over, my room becomes so messy that I cannot take. I'm not good at telling things on people's  face and he often tells me to change this habit and suggests me to just say it if I don't like something but I cannot :|. <br><br>In the last summer holidays, he somehow managed to get an internship in Microsoft - Bangalore (I still wonder how did he do that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). He called me once from there and it was quite surprising and unexpected as I could have never expected a call from him <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. One day I somehow managed to convince Maroo that my marriage is fixed. I don't know how but he convinced Pappu about the same <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Hats off to Maroo for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> because I could have never imagined that Pagare will believe something like that. He called me that night and shouted that how can I do such a thing and blah blah. He reciprocated with something similar and much more shocking few days back. He told me something so shocking that I could not believe it for quite some time but eventually I did because he told me with so much conviction that no one could have disagreed with him <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. That whole day I could not do anything, just pondered over it and that ass told me in the evening that it was just a joke. Man to aisa ho raha tha wahin maar doon use <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 3</b><br>In Microsoft-Hyd's 10th anniversary party, I said him somethings which I shouldn't. I'm extremely sorry for that and deeply regret for the same. He is one of the reasons why I patched up with Raman after our long running fight. He always insisted me for talking to Raman and finally I did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... <br><br>I don't know how and when exactly, but we have become very good friends in the last 5-6 months. Frankly speaking if someone would have asked me if I would write a testimonial for Pappu a year back, my answer would have probably been a "NO". Now I'm here with such a big testimonial, shows that things gave turned up drastically between us <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He always leofy me. I usually enjoy his leofying but sometimes he just pisses me off. He needs to learn where to draw the line and he sometimes crosses the line and says something which he shouldn't have. He has a peculiar quality of pointing out very minute things in people's behaviours'. He has given me the name "Budhau" <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> and that too for a wierd reason. Actually he called me Dadaji  and later he realised that its too respectful and changed it to Budhau. Most of the names given to the people around are result of his mastermind. I enjoy each n every moment spent with him and he always makes me laugh <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Aajkal use naya hi shauk chadhha hai. Koi bhi gane ki parody banata rehta hai aur us parody mein ya to "baal" hote hain ya "budhau" ya dono <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... bechara bohot speed se ganja ho raha hai <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>He always used to say that he will not cry for going to Pune whatever happens but last time when we were drunk he just broke down. I could not handle this and started crying myself. Later he just came to me and said something in my ear. From that instant itself I started laughing and kept on laughing for the next 5 minutes. This is how he is, changing moods so frequently that its difficult to judge what's going on in his mind <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. <br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 4</b><br>Looks can be deceptive and this aptly suits him. You see him and first thing that strikes you is his cute and innocent looking face. But believe me he is not at all innocent. He is one of the sharpest and cunniest person I have ever met <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I'm not sure about this but people often say that earlier he used to be very open and frank, used to say anything about him to anyone. But now, he doesn't and its really really difficult to get something out of him. This shows his level of maturity and sincerity. But still he is very childish <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. His body is so flexible that four equally sized Pagares can sleep on one hostel bed "comfortably" without disturbing one another <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He holds some strange chemistry with Raman and Vibhav <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Sabki daroo isi ne start karayi hai. He is so good at convincing that one cannot refuse him anything <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>As I mentined before, he does not open up easily and its really really tough to make him speak anything about himself. Whenever I ask him something his reply is "are dade ab kya bataun main tujhe, tum samjhoge nahin. itni badi story hai iske peechhe ab kya hi bataein tumhe" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>If I have to pick a bad quality of him, it would be his selfishness. He is a bit selfish at times. But he has so many other qualities that one can just overlook this one <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Recently I noticed one more thing about him. He is very proudy and thinks that he is the most perfect guy and every other person is a ch***ya. He feels whatever he says is correct and others are wrong in whatever they say or do. But my dear this is not rue at all <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. One more problem is that he cannot take anything said against him and he needs to work on it. Sabki maarta rehta hai but just as you say anything against him he gets angry.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 5</b><br>He got placed in the initial days itself and that too with a handsome package but the problem is that he will be going to Pune. I'm gonna miss him a lot because I love it when he leofy me and cheer me up when I'm down <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. I'm so used to his leofying that I cannot stay for a day without that. He is among those very few people who have made such an impression in my life that will be long lasting and will never fade away.<br><br><b>Most memorable moment</b> will be the Microsoft party, your marriage chat in canteen and those infinite moments when you teased me.<br><br>Don't ever change yourself for anything.

I have never seen him upset for something for more than a few hours. He is the one who knows everything about my ups and downs. Our bonding is becoming more strong as the time is passing and we often do emotional BC when he uses many uncommon hindi words. Some times he irritates me for no reason by commenting something but I know he doesn't mean it and do this just for fun. In our 3rd year I recognized his one more talent - leadership,  when he did a commendable job in felicity and single handidly managed the cultural work.

I happen to believe that if he could not have made it to any engineering college, he would have been playing for the current Indian team since one of his club teammate plays in IPL. <br><br>He is a very good looking guy and has a nice sense of dressing but bechara apni naak se dukhi raheta hai. I always try to leofy him but due to his quick witted replies everything goes against me, has a great sense of humor, he has always been the reason for making us laugh. To lighten the mood, everytime he tries to come up with something (mostly crapy) which makes everyone laugh. He has a typical style of asking people to think upon something like " teri 5 best actresses kaun kaun si hai " or " tere 5 sabse gande incident kaun kaun se hai" or "tujhe IIIT me 5 sabse achchi bandiya kaun kaun si lagti hai" and this sometimes calls a debate.  <br><br>These days he has become very careful about his diet and he desperately want to have six packs <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> and that killer attitude forces me too to have a decent physique but I am so lazy that don't go to gym regularly <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>Pagare's funda about friends is that you always live with them, for them. He has set high standards for friendship. It might be a cliche, but he is absolutely always there for you as a friend. In my first two years, whenever I'd fall sick, he would be the first one to take me to a hospital. I can never forget that. In fact, hes done a lot for all his pals. But well, hes often been let down by his friends. And being the kind of emotional guy he was, he'd feel hurt by the same. But then again, he has changed a lot over time. Hes moulded himself, and he has much lesser expectations from his mates now. He also is less into the senti-menti stuff now, hes become more stable in the mind and heart. I guess its all a part of growing up, and comes with the maturity you achieve. And I would take a lot of negative credit for that. There were so many instances when I'd let out some shit and let him down. There were these innumerable instances when I really hurt him. But credit to him and others (Bhalu, Adi etc) who often helped us patch up, and our friendship is still going strong.<br><br>In our group, hes the one who makes a lot of plans. It comes with his basic nature, which is the inclination to keep having fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But well, he has a lot of lofty and wierd ideas as well, which never get executed <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I've done two internships with this chap, at Greenspace after 2nd year and at Microsoft after 3rd year. And both have given us some very memorable moments. Right from the first day at Barista to the flight back home. Earning our first ever pay cheques at Greenspace was an awesome experience. We'd go to office, drink some coffee, orkut a lot, have lunch, orkut some more, have snacks and come back <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Well, it was not too different in Microsoft <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Only thing, we had <br>foosball too then <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Paro, Khatri, Piyush, Pappu and me had an absolute blast in Bangalore.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>But forget the dance for a while, Pagare is oozing with talent! Its almost as if when you touch him, some of the talent will wet your hands. Its another matter that hes not always utilizied them. For example, this guy can be an awesome author- some of his posts on his blog are a testimony to that. But well, its his priorities in life which are actually very simple. He just wants to have a good and simple life, lots of fun and great friends and family. Thats it. No hefty ambitions, nothing. And due to that, I feel that some of his talent has been lost in the process of going with the flow.<br><br>Talking about talents, I'd do injustice to the testimonial if I do not mention cricket. Hes one the best cricketers around. His inswingers, lethal. His bunny, the best batsman in IIIT, Ruhela. For me, hes been an amazing captain to have. From the 15th man to a player in the IIIT squad- all credit to Pagare and Varun for that. And his inspirational speeches which he gives to the UG2K5 batch before every match <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Other memories here would be the awesome wins we've had as Aakash house mates and last year's win over 2K6. In fact, the 2K6 win and the subsequent party at Eat Street counts among my most memorable moments in IIIT.<br><br>Talking about memorable moments, there have been a host of them with this chap. Its almost as if we have been linked together by destiny.. Internships in Greenspace and Microsoft together, similar courses, same BTP.. In fact, during the placement season, it was the butt of our jokes- we thought we'd ultimately land up in the same company. Fortunately or unfortunately, hes going to Pune, and I feel for him.

But everytime, he is there again. As a friend. As your mate. <br><br>Well, I'd infact call him the walking definition of friendship. Be it his intricate knowledge about all his friends' lives, their feelings, their habits etc. Be it his habit of handing out just the perfect nicknames to his mates. Be it his idea of playing "Yaaron.." just after the conclusion of Felicity '08. Thats one of the most beautiful moments not just with him, but with the entire batch. Pagare got the song played and unbelievable scenes followed. Everyone came <br>together in a circle and sung the lovely song along. I could see moist eyes all around me.

All my emotions came gushing out after the 'sabha' conducted by Pagare. Ahh.. and that 'sabha', bloody hilarious it was! Well, this chap can be very witty; with a twirl of his fingers, he can make people laugh. Many a time, he livens up the mood with a witty remark or comment.<br><br>The other thing about his 'sabha' thingy is that this guy loves being the cynosure of all eyes. And its not just that, hes got the talent to back that up. Everyone can testify that hes the best dancer around. Its such a pleasure to see him execute his moves on stage. I keep telling him, "Pagare, I've always wanted to learn dance." and he keeps urging me to take it up. Hell, after some classes, I've realised that its not my cuppa tea <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Memory associated here, would be the "Aari aari" dance sequences <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ahh.. And Salsa, hes always been wanting to take up salsa classes for obvious reasons <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But hes not got himself to do so even after 4 years of post teen singlehood! <br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
