<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mote<br>He is my sutta partner. Whenever we meet the first question we ask each other is "sutta hai?".<br>He is the classic example of first impression going wrong. First look, he always had a lazy eye and a thumping gait. Did not talk much in the first year apart from some ragging sessions together. Bhai was the ten pointer in first sem, but now he has come above grades after his experiences in the fourth sem.<br>After third year we came to OBH and our short ciggs sessions started. Whenever I am in shortage of ciggs I visit his room. I have never seen a person as brainy as him.  He is the best when it comes to teaching any stuff. He would take the notes read it for half an hour and teach<br>everyone, he would also explain things which were never discussed in the class. I still remember during placement time, he was worried about not getting through Amazon.I asked him how was his interview ? He said "yaar unke questions kam pad gaye the to unhone na! BC, MC ek tough DP ka question de diya". He never eats in the campus, you can always find him in McD or Subway. He is one guy who would always stand for his friends.<br>"Bhai dil ke bahut aache hain".I still remember, one day how sad he was because he did not interact with many people in the batch.  He has very simple funda about life, never really works hard. He knows that he can manage a nine CG even if he studies half an hour before the exam.<br>Anytime you go, you could find something to eat in his room. He is an avid gamer and flaunts a PSP. <br>Some Memories- all the sutts we had together, your algorithm ke funde during placements, night out just before the day placement started, subway ki trip.<br>I admire him a lot for his modesty. I wish  you achieve great heights mote!<br><br>Cheers!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If there is one person who I respect the most for sheer intelligence, it has to be him. I've heard stories about him (mostly from Khatri), and it is amazing listening to the things he does. I mean missing the MS interview just for gaming.. Sheer passion for it!<br><br>I've not interacted much with him, but of whatever little, he has left an impression. In first year, I remember him coming to the workspace at 8 PM, 4 hours before Jaw's assigment deadline. He came, wrote a few lines, compiled, uploaded and went away. All in two freakin hours! And the rest of us would not have spent less than ten times that. He made us look like morons of the first order!<br><br>I'll also remember the interactions in fourth year in his wing, he is another of those football freaks. Besides, he has a good knowledge base in varied fields, and hence is good to discuss stuff with <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I'm sure that once you have a passion for life, there is absolutely <i>nothing</i> which can stop you. <br><br><b>Fav memory: The daroo kaand last year.<br>Message for him: Hume mat bhulna <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Ankit Saraswat</u><br><br>One of the very few people who I truly and deeply respect for their sheer intelligence and the only one in our batch. There must have been many a discussions on who must be the most intelligent guy in our batch and for me it will always be  him.Since first semester, he has been an iconic figure in the batch, being the first and only 10 pointer in first sem. Everybody in this batch must have heard countless stories of his intelligence and yet his stories continue to amaze me. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> At times I just wish I had a brain even half as bright as his.<br><br>He was the first guy from IIIT I met, we met during the couselling in Allahabad. My mother was quite excited to see a guy from home town (Agra). He was the classic example of first impression going wrong. The first time I saw the guy, he seemed to just a dumb guy. I don't think I could have been more wrong in judging this guy.<br><br>Havent had the oppuritinty to interact much with him but whatever little interaction we had has always been pleasant. I will always be thankful to him for the endless supplies of sutte when he & me were the only smokers in our batch but unfortunately whenever he would come to my room, I would never have a cig. Thanks for all those suttes man <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>One thing which I would always remember is the animosity we had in later part of our 1st year and 2nd year and its resolution. There was some misunderstanding which resulted in a bitter hatred amongst us. I remember, it was he who came and talked to me sometime in 2nd yr (I guess) which dissolved all the animosity. I seriously couldnt believe my ears on listening to the casual tone in which he talked to me. It was as if nothing had happened, just so simple and nice. My admiration for you, grew multifolds that particular day.<br><br>I don't think you need good wishes from anybody in this world. You can do WHATEVER you like... Bow to thee man!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> but then again will say <br><br>All the best dude.. <br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking....<br><br>Keep in touch...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>10 pointer of our batch ... too intelligent ... i still remember our internship @ amazon ... he used to grasp things like a recording machine ... somethings were like french, german to me but this guy was like pure translator of everything ... very kind-hearted person and very very very helping nature ... i remember how some of the things went very smoothly during my internship bcoz of him .... hold this quality always with u dude ... keep rocking always and "asusual"</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br><b>Academically, </b>as everyone knows, he's a genius. How he understands the previous, and the next lectures just sitting and looking at the prof teaching, is beyond me. This genius of his is manifested everywhere. He runs through courses in one night and gets A. He studies for interviews for one day and leaves even the interviewers dumbfounded. Makes his BTP, which I know the previous ones took a lot of time and effort, in a matter of days. Used to complete his entire C and DS assignments in a matter of a few hours. Makes OS codes which the tutors could not understand...<br><br>His CV, bulky as it may be, still does not show his true genius. For he's also an aalsee suar, with no big ambitions to change the world, or make a huge name for himself, or any such. He wants to enjoy his life, and is quite happy to not write the M$ intern exam in return for playing FIFA manager the whole night. I think you could've gone still further, but you're one guy who's laidback, knows how much he wants and is comfortable with what he has. And that's something very refreshing and new in today's cut-throat competitve world. <br><br><b>Finally, I have no words</b> for all your kindnesses over the years. From standing firmly beside me during all the problems I've faced, sometimes risking your own neck for me. To the tutes before the exams. I suspect many of the wingmates owe their BTech to you. And their placements, too. I would never have had the know-how to crack all those written exams, and the  balls to face the interviews had it not been for your placement tutes. <br><br>This doesn't end quite here. I owe you a long, long one. Leaving college, and this testimonial just marks this moment as you're one guy I know I'll always remain friends with. <br><br><b><i>To the future!</b></i><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><b>Here's the first one</b> in the wing, and the one who deserves it the most.<br><br>Saraswat, one of the best pals I made in IIIT. Has been in the next room for the past three years, so I guess I don't have to go on an year-by-year record. And even if I tried to, the things are simply too many to recall.<br><br><b>This guy is quite a </b>character. Not a day passes by when he doesn't make us laugh. He's so full of it, in almost every small thing he does. Right from the typical way he sits in front of his PC, smokes sutta after sutta, to the way he walks, gets blasted by Saurabh over games, football matches and almost everything, the way he drinks, eats out, gives a shit about his health, gets his pics clicked, plays football, says 'doFAIR' for dopahar and bhAAIncho' for B***. It never fails to amuse us, and the wing will be all but incomplete without him.<br><br>But apart from all that, he's a really sensitive guy, and one person who is very very dedicated to his friends. To the extent that I sometimes wonder whether I really deserve such a friend. He cares about every one of his friends in every small way possible. Never says no to anyone who asks him for anything, be it eating out, or teaching, any PC problem, or playing some game, or drink, or whatever. We at times make fun of him, but of course each and every one in the wing knows how special it is to have saraswat around us.<br><br><b>During these years, I know I haven't been fair to you, and I've admitted that to you also. Third year was not a good time for me. And it's really mature of you to have understood, and forgiven this gross immaturity of mine. </b><br><br><i>contd.</i><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ankit Saraswat or Fusion, probably the most intelligent among us. Right from first sem he has shown consistency w/o much effort. Perfect 10 in first sem itself is mind-boggling <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. C assignment kitna bhi tough ho ya lengthy ho, he always completes them in 1 sitting <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Altough a 9 pointer throughout, he never studies too hard, I wonder how he manage to score that much GPA <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> may be because of his attention in class and intelligence.<br> Apart from gaming he is excellent gamer.In first year, he is the master of AOE, persian civilization mein jo haathi pe haathi bnata tha, saamne wale ki fatt jaati thi, itne haathi ek saath dekh kar. He taught me how to play AOE. Aajkal CZ mein bhi <b>fusion</b> ka aatank barkarar hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br> Been outing with him many times. He is very caring of others, always looks if everyone with him is comfortable <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> A down to earth guy and very friendly in nature. Be the same dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Wish you all the best for your future and Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- CZ, AOE, your knowledge in various fields.<br>Most Memorable moments :- First year AOE, 4-2 CZ<br>Msg for U: - Quit Smoking<br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
