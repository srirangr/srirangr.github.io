Mujhe kuch nahi aata, etc. etc."</i> <br><br>Khair, Abhishek, named <b>Scientist</b> by his wing mates for his innocent and never ending questions, has been a person who has not changed by much in these four years. He is the same innocent looking, humble, polite, courteous, and <b>chhupa rustam</b> even today.<br><br><br>Writes very well, and dances well too. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Has this charming smile that reminds you of your childhood days <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. He is very hardworking and quite intelligent, <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> only that he never admits either.<br><br>Can give you good insights regarding certain philosophical issues. I found his opinion and ideas related to those issues quite interesting <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Chalo fir Sainani, hope you get done with your M.S. quickly and may you always get the best in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sainani or Sainu or Scientist....a very cute little guy. Heard a lot about his PJ's in the 1st year, then knew him more when he came to NBH 3rd floor in 3rd year. He thinks a lot before saying anything and chooses appropriate <i>fatta</i> according to the situation. Hats-off to his never ending fattebaazi <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Apart from this, he is a very hard-working person. In every semester, he takes the hardest of all the courses and still manages to get good grades <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Never makes anyone angry. Very helping in nature. Many times he gave me medicines whenever I got ill <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>He has a passion for trying out new things, playing sports etc <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He also suggested to me a lot of good hollywood movies. I enjoyed a lot working him during the SE presentation. He is an extremely talented actor too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best Sainu for your future. Hope you'll complete your MS soon. Take Care and be in touch. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>people call him 'scientist' .. I don't know how appropriate that is <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. but one thing which I've noticed by the means of conversing with him is that he has quite a unique sense of things <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>we started to talk in the 3rd semester... during the English Literature course... I've found him to be always interested in discussions be it philosophical, scientific, supernatural <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , fantasy n all <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>the story he wrote 'sleeping in the classes' was really good and it deserved to be the title for the forthcoming book of our stories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>he has always asked me about various books and movies and TV shows... I'm glad that he has read The Fountainhead on my suggestion.. and I do hope he found it very unique <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>and finally his keen sense of observation and pulling out non-stop logical PJs from trivial conversations is praise worthy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>I wish you all the success in career n life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers !!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[Part 2 of 3]<br><br>3)The Scary Part:<br>	Abhishek ... Scary ............. Never. But Abhishek is scared of the dark, ghosts, zombies and all dark evil forces. Once he rang me up at 1:15 AM and asked me to come to Abhinavs room. I went and then he asked me to accompany him to his room (reason: He just watched some scary scenes of The Ring or Grudge) and abhinavs room was just one wing away. That clearly shows how scared he is.<br>	Message for you: Watch Horror Movies that is the best way to get rid of fear of darkness. [I follow this]<br><br>4)Work ... Work ... Work:<br>	Apart from Movies/TvSHows the only thing Abhishek does is work or spend time fearing that he might not complete his work. A Java geek he is and does most of his work in Java which in turn is quite cumbersome as it creates loads of files. [ He once had 20,000 files in 2 GB and it took me about 25 minutes to copy all those files as a backup]. <br><br>5)Creativity:<br>	Abhishek is no doubt the most creative person <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I have seen in IIIT. This guys imagination goes beyond limits and hence people call him the Scientist but it is when people go beyond limits that new Inventions and Innovations begin to happen. I m pretty confident that his creativity will help him publish a research paper which will blow people's mind. <br>	He has wonderful Ideas on concepts of Superheroes, Scifi stories and fictional characters. He treasures all these Ideas in his laptop and does it regularly. He also saves quotations of others, his own in another document which he often uses as his status message.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[Part 1 of 3]<br><br>Abhishek Sainani is one of the most special person I have ever seen. He became a very close friend of mine when he shifted to a room right opposite to mine. He is glued to his laptop just like me but he spends his time in different activities like chatting, social networking, programming, reading which I dont prefer.<br><br>Few points worth mentioning about Abhishek:<br>1)TV Shows/Movies:<br>	He is one of the very few who shares my movie interests and we generally like a movie alike. He has interest in various genres but doesnt like horror movies and avoids them altogether. Abhishek is able to watch all these movies in his "matrix effected" Laptop Screen.<br>	Best Movie he recommended me: Man from the Earth<br><br>	And Coming to TV Shows, On his suggestion I started watching my First TV Show "Heroes" and It was amazing to watch 1 1/2 seasons without any break. Then onwards we had huge discussions on Heroes which made Kharkwal and Rahul frustrated and guess what we used to make many correct guesses and used to predict to some extent. Abhishek watches many other TV Shows which I dont watch, he has the same interest in all shows and watches them with deep dedication.<br>	Best Show Suggested: Heroes<br><br>2)The Funny Side:<br>	Abhishek is a really funny guy ... people accuse him of PJs which at times he tells. Abhishek and Atul are one of the most funniest duos I have ever seen ... each time they come together, it is a treat for people who are watching that scene. Whenever I wanted to have some fun I used to visit his room and started irritating him ... thats when he becomes the funniest.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>sainani is very cute...i remember the first english class where marathe sir called him and said..."he's handsome"...lol...used to sleep in every other class in our first year <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...we gave him a name <img src=Smileys/3.gif />..."sleeping beauty" he has a wonderful smile....and his bluffmaster dance was just awesome <img src=Smileys/6.gif />...all the best ...u ll be here for one more years anyways <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Scientist. very early memory with this chap is from the first year when I often used to hang around in his room with Atul. I knew very little about him then. Onething for sure, he was very good to atul's friend. I admire him the way he has adjusted with Atul for two years. iske room mai ek samay mai kaafi log ghuse rehte the aur BC chalti thi. I can very well remember the day when atul and aniket were playing guitar, Bajaj was doing BC and I was sketching. Despite of all this noise and disturbance he was busy reading a novel.<br><br>Tab itne PJs ka collection nahi tha iske paas. But ab to bhai har line infact har word pe ek fatta mapped hai. He claims that its his unique way to defend against enemies. And to some extent it has workout for him. <br><br>Man I am impressed by your innocence and miss you for some of your wonderful fattas. Good wishes for your wonderful career ahead. May god bless!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> Part 1 - <b><br><br>Scientist aka sainani aka sain aka santu singh .... <br>one of the most decent guys of our batch. <br>A unique piece of our college <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We both were in same discussion groups.... there I came to know abt him. Isko class me sone ki bimari hai. poore din room par soya ho but class me jarur sota hai. PJ king of our batch. His PJs are really innovative which a normal person can not even think <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . He is really hard working ....<br>Whenever I went to his room....most of the time I found him reading some research paper n all. He became a consistent 9 pointer from a 6 pointer,it shows his determination <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .<br> Also he is a good listener so When you need someone to talk contact sainani. He helped me a lot in writing my story during English Literature course. Dude It would not hv been so better without your help. <br>When he was on my floor I used to tell him my stories and my life experiences , he always motivated me to write them, one day day I'll definitely write them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br>He used to have a nerdy image.... but one day when he came to stage and danced so good on " Sabse bada rupaiyya" everyone was like shocked ..<br>Also he is a good writer.... so many good poems and stories he have written. Gtalk ka addict hai.... kabhi bhi iske room me jao .... bhanu kiran ya kisi or se chat karta jarur milega. If he uninstall gtalk( I knw he'd say gmail is <br>another option to chat <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ) he can save his a lot of time. His unique hair style gives him a unique and kiddish look <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>He can give a scientific or philosophical possibility about anything . He has very calm nature. I hv never seen him getting angry. <br>When he was on NBH 3rd floor, I used to go to his room and start irritating him. I love to irritate him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . So many memories with you are still charished in my mind <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br><br>Overall he is a sensible, hard working, friendly and witty guy.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhishek Sainani aka Scientist is the PJMan. Everyone in our batch will remember him for his fattas. Well....for me he is a very helpful guy. Has helped me a lot. Never said 'No' to me. Waise hum dono ki BC bhi bahut jyada hui hai..aur <br>woh bhi random baton par. hmmm.....waise BC random baton par hi hoti hai....Pahle yeh mujhe kabhi serious banda lagta tha.. aur mujhe aisa lagta tha ki yeh sirf padhai likhai hi karta tha...but in 6th sem we came to interact more because of DDBMS course. This was the best course for me...not from the point of view of academics but  da reason is dat I came into contact with some of the awesome ppl of the batch due to this course and Scientist certaily falls in that category. Is indeed a very good friend of mine. I have spent some quality time with him Bcing mode of academics, aim of life, religion, philosophy and blah blah blah.. ek samay aisa aa gaya tha ki mein ise dekhte hi philosophical ho jata tha. During placement preparation period, I was kinda frustrated at times and he was my sink where I could spit out everything which I wanted to and he would listen to me patiently. Thanx bro for all da support and your time. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... <br><br><br>Jab mein dheere dheere is ke contact mein aaya to mujhe pata chala ki iska jyada time english movies, tv serials, cartoons aur wikipedia mein nikalta hai..Yeh BC bhi bahut tej karta hai... Iske saath sabse badi problem yeh hai ki when you are serious, he will just crack a fatta. And when you are BC mood and ask him to crack a fatta.. he will become damn serious as if kisi ne maar diya ho ise. Sudhar Ja bhai...aur sahi samay par sahi kaam kar. Is quite introvert type and prefers to remain silent in group, even if he is sitting wid all of his close friends.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Apne scientist bhai, one of the sweetest person one can find. You say him anything and he never gets angry. His PJs are a real pain in the ass and sometimes really really difficult to listen to him. I usually meet him on the dinner table and he always has thi smile which will make you smile and greet him. Very innocent and pure at heart. I don't think he ever keeps hard feelings for anyone. I remember one incident during Ragging sessions when we were told to do the legendary "athhanni chawanni" and he refused. That day he was treated quite differently by the seniors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I always enjoy his company and will have the privelege to have some more time with him due to our MS <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>God bless you.

<b><a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>After continuous nagging for days, here comes a testimonial for Abhishek. <br>I don't remember how we first met or when we first talked, all i know is that we lived in the same hostel. People have been calling him 'Scientist' since first year of college. As a matter of fact, the first time i heard this name 'Scientist', i thought that he must be some kind of self boasting, arrogant bastard, but as we can all see, it turned out the opposite. Champ ( as i fondly call him ) is a very cute, funny and 'Interesting' person. Even though he is very lazy, stubborn and a typical sindi, but you just can't hate him. Even though he is a dual degree student, but he hardly works on his research project and I can still remember how long did he take to decide what he wanted to do for his MS Project. He is full of weird, yet creative, ideas and was also working with dandu on a story, but it soon lost steam, but be it now or later  he'll definitely come up with something. One thing that should be said about Champ is that he never falls short of ways of wasting time. He has been doing it since first year and I know he'll continue to do it in the future as well. There's another thing about him that should find a mention here - he has taken some very difficult courses in these 4 years and has also secured good grades in them     (something very commendable for a lazy person like him). Even though he is very lethargic, but when he's working he puts in all his effort (again, something not many people can do). THE END<br>Dude, are you happy now? Please prepare a draft if you didn't like this testimonial. I'll just paste that. <br>I forgot, he watches some 272 odd TV-Series ( THE FIGURE IS NOT EXAGGERATED ). No wonder why he doesn't find time to work on his project and attend classes. </b></i></ul><br><br>

We both just replied with a smile.<br>        He is simple, quite introvert (wont tell u much about his routine or any plans) which can<br>irritate u sometimes.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>         He speaks a lot of illogical things all the time (i guess unknowingly) just to gain people's attention. Well whatever makes u happy!<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. But i remember he once came to my room and asked me "Why dont anyone talk to me?" and i replied,"Are you sure you dont know the reason?"<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, well i think he knew it. <br>        I used to take him with me for my evening jog and it really helped us both a lot<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.

<b><a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Well, one of the very few people in our batch to whom one could open his/her heart out. One of the best poets of our batch, Sainani has been a good friend of mine. All that crap we've talked about in your room at night has been really memorable. The best part was neither of us knew why we talked about such things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (I might be wrong in his case though). I love pissing him off <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> because he is one guy who hardly loses his cool. Mostly, it is the other way round with him when it comes to pissing someone off ('Fattas' et el) <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Love it when he goes crazy listening to my wonderful <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> imitation of Kabra's voice (disgusting in his opinion).<br><br>Well, on to some serious stuff. Sainani is an extremely hard working guy whom one would find always hooked onto his laptop. Famous for taking one of the toughest (and of high intellect) courses and getting A's, he has a never say die which I really like about him. No matter how many problems he has in life (which he rarely discloses) he still manages to come out fighting. <br>I admire his literary prowess and must say that he is among the best in our batch. Writing prose/poetry is one thing but appreciating it is another. Here is one guy who can do both with great panache and flair (You'll do great as a literary critic <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The best way to know about him is to read his works in poetry. So efficient at reading research papers, I am sure you'll be one heck of a researcher one day. We've had a very idiosyncratic relationship relationship but it has been fun being friends.<br><br>All the best for the future buddy and hope that you soon zero in on a research topic and get your MS.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He used to sit next to me in First years' classes and second year also. Besides we were in same hostel and same floor in GHEB. I can say I have spent lots of time with this person.I never saw him with eyes open listening to any lectures in first year. He has this great skill of sitting erect and silently drooping his eyelids behind his spects. Even the prof has the impression he is so meekly listening to the lectures. The whole first year he spent sleeping in the class. When I asked him why he do so...he said that he din slept the whole night. There was BC going on his room..The dude, Atul DVD was his room partner. So neither he study in classes nor in room. This guy was so trapped...and he screwed big time with his grades. Later in second year he realised. So despite the noisy BC atmosphere in his room, U will find him huddled in a corner, fingers plugging his ears...and concentrating hard on his course book.But he never complained. Might be he liked those goofy talks...and soon he mastered the way of studying with background BC going on.<br><br>He dreams a lot..see weird to weirdest dreams. And then he recount them to me in exact details. Inspired by his dreams he began to write a blog where he narrates his dreams. He infact wrote a good long story titled  "sleeping in class" for his literature course. And this story is going to publish soon..congrats scientist.<br>This person has got some sparky wires in his brain. Crack PJs of utmost quality- true to their defination. Those chats in NBH mess table will be remembered scientist for long. <br>When I was new to college, I found certain degree of ease in his room..I wud come quite often in his room and he wud greet me with that extended curve smile resembling of a joker <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He is a great dancer too..I guess ppl might be knowing this on our batch.

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Abhishek Sainani aka Scientist</u><br>I remember this guy right from our first year when both of us were in 'B' section in our 1st year. Right from time immemorial, I can remember  him as the studious type of guy who was always sincere in classes, reaching classes in time, NO BC, no nothing of that kind. But in the class, all I could ever find him doing in the class was SLEEPING... He is legendary in the batch circles for his sleeping (and ofcourse his PJs, which I will talk about later).<br><br>I will always remember  this chap as a sweet, soft spoken, mild person. He has always seems to be so calm and balanced, I seriously don't know what is it that would take for him to be perturbed. I am quite confident that if I failed in the attempt, there wouldnt be many people who can stand up to this challenge.<br><br>Ofcourse nobody in this batch can ever forget the legendary fattes of Scientist, which have made his roomie Atul, pull out his hair at times. Thankfully I have never been a subject to this treatment ever.<br>He has also been an enthusiastic blogger of our batch, some of his posts and poems have been an absolute delight to read. I would also like to thank him for all the discussions I had with him over some of my poem, would like to thank him for all the insights I gained into my poems coz of his valuable comments.<br><br><b>Fav Memory :- All the chats we had, specially the chat while I was writing the poem "Fear of the Dark"<br>An advice :- Just be as you are, you are too gud a guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b><br><br>Cheers!!

Has taken WDKM with me and came my rum to understand some research paper, I was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. DWDM mein toh apna TA tha, he lost my script <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> anyway thanx for giving avg. marks in that. He is a guest member of our BC grp.

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br><b>People call him scientist,</b> which in my opinion is an anomaly now, 'coz he's more of a poet than a scientist. Is really sensitive about poetry and music, something which shows in the songs he writes. They're really good, and I think with some practice, this guy can really be a good song writer. I'll remember the long discussions we've had about poetry. Well, about other topics as well. They really helped me shape my own thinking. Our discussions have been really intense and there aren't many people today in the college that I communicate at such depth with. <br><br>One of his remarkable qualities is that he's very objective about whatever you talk to him about. This makes him not a very good candidate if you need an agnoy aunt for your feelings, but if you need an honest, impartial view and a fresh perspective on yourself to figure out things on your own, Abhishek is a priceless person to approach.<br><br>In my final year I got to know him, and now he's one of my very good friends. I'll cherish the time we spend together. May this friendship grow bigger and better!     <br><br><b>Tags:</b> CogSci classes, discussions, poetry, Agni.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><b>Scientist, bachcha, fattebaz </b>and what not for others, but for me he's just plain simple Abhishek. That's 'coz I saw him properly very late in my college life. People usually form opinions based not necessarily not on their own, but on others' perception of a person, and I'm no exception. But it's my good luck to have come to know Abhishek properly only in the final year, and that too very well. So I see him as he is now, and not in the light of my, or anyone else's preconceived notions. <br><br>He is one person who desires to think originally. And he does pull out good ideas, too. But it seems to me that in the past either he's not been able to present those ideas well, or people haven't taken them as well as they should have, or maybe it's just the fun culture of leofying present in our circles that seems to have taken its price, but he doesn't have as much confidence in this priceless quality of his as it deserves. Also, striving to think deep about things in these times, when you have so much of data to handle can take its toll. You have to prioritise things my friend, agreed, 'coz there is only so much you can live, but I think you can leave the TV serials aside and live a little bit more of life outside it. Life outside the PC is a little more that mere socializing. Your dances in the first year stand testimony to that.<br><br><b>Leaving the Cognitve Science aside,</b> I'd say that Abhishek is a sincere, dedicated and soft spoken guy. You have to see the courses he takes to believe it. And the projects and the thesis work. He has taught quite a lesson to me in terms of sincerity, by simply stating about our project work 'interest le ke kaam karenge'. Even among all the words that I write and read all day long, this is one line that's gonna stay with me for quite some time. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sainani / Bacha / Scientist is one of the cuteeeest kids around. Never complaining about anything and always has a cute smile on his face. is a very good friend of  mine.<br><br>My first acquaintance with this guy was during the Freshers. We were in the front row doing "Kajra Re" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Then I knew that he;s a good dancer. We were also in the play doing some BC. <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> and from then on we were always together for the rest of first year. We used to do almost all of the assignments on our own <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. We used to go to the library <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> and he used to sleep there quite oftenly <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. One very important thing I have noticed about him in these 4 years is that he has a 'never say die' attitude and keeps fighting(sleep <img src=Smileys/24.gif />) for whatever he wants and never quits until it is achieved.<br><br>When I was in GHEB, I used to go to his room for time pass. coz Atul and Sainani were the best. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> There always used to be some or the other intresting topic. Always lives in his own world of fantasy. I still remember one day (before freshers)he said "Dont you think OBH is like an old palace where black magic wizards live <img src=Smileys/10.gif />".and I was like WTF?! <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> Whats he talking about?! Also he was very shy to speak the swear words. I think today he's comfortable using them. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br><br>He has immense knowledge on literature and books. Whenever I'm bored I ask him to suggest one of his fav book and no doubt its A-W-Esome. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He was also my partner in DumbC in 1st and 4th year. It was a rocking experience to share stage with you both in Kajra Re and DumbC <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Baap bada na bhaiyya .. sabse bada rupaiya was his best performace ever in IIIT with all expressions and all. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Hope that with your 'never say die' attitude you reach great heights.<br><br>Love<br>DJ.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Scientist- another of those guys who always has a smile on his face. He is sincere little chap, who is always looking for ways to improve himself. I really like that about him. And a very valid point which Bajaj made- he does crack fattas, but a lot of those are called PJs because nobody has an answer to them. He is still as inquisitve as a child, which is so very refreshing. But yes, it does get onto you at times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I will remember Sainani for the conversations we've had on the dinner table. We'd talk on a plethora of topics- from sitcomes to cricket to life to Jeevan Vidya. In fact, hes promised that he'd have his first beer with me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> That day has come buddy <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>Its also been fun leofying him. That comes with the urge to hit back at his PJs. But hell, he takes everything with a smile on his face. I have NEVER seen him getting agitated. Which is wonderful. I'll also take back all the gtalk conversations I've had with scientist.

<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Scientist as we call him, is the one person you can rely on at any time for anything. He was famous for his PJs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and for sleeping in the class in first semester <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I just want to say that most of the times we just cann't argue with you on a particular issue and that's why try to avoid confrontation by saying that it is a fatta...  <br>I could talk to him hours abt movies...  and various interests of hollywood actors.<br>His helping and patient nature can be made out from the many instances in which he helped Atul so many times even after he was the one who used to frustrate him the most. He is one of the most reliable person if you want any thing to get done.<br>Mostly he comes out as a guy who is extremely punctual abt his routine but that is not true. He watches sitcoms all night long and still can attend all the lectures the next day. <br>He is one of the guys with whom I used to love playing CZ and age because of his innocent mistakes and queries <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We used to beg him to play Age with us.<br>Though he watches many sitcoms and movies but he is also very punctual when it comes to studying. He never misses a lecture or never forgets to do assignments even when others have decided not to do that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I have seen him reading in his room while Atul and Aniket used to practise songs in the same room. You cann't ask for a better roommate than scientist. <br>He is also a very good dancer and actor. You once told me that you want to write a movie story and win an oscar for it. I hope you keep trying for it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br>I hope that you will not change except for the fact that you must be a little for confident in yourself and then you can do wonders...<br>Best of Luck for your MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sainani is a person with very different shades. Right from moments where he looks very serious when he replies to nothing the other person is saying to the moments where you see him laughing hysterically and literally rolling on the floor with laughter.<br>Atul already said about his love for chatting. Sincere, Hardworking and very down to earth. <br>He sometimes underestimates himself a lot. He writes wonderfully. Just need to believe in yourself and you will surely do wonders. <br>Best of luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  </b></i></ul><br><br>
