<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Divya:<br>The first girl I interacted with in the college. We were in the same group under the mentor,Kiran sir.<br>Once standing outside a lab waiting for Kiran sir to come,she approached me for introduction and I guess that time we <br>became friends. She was and is very good in speaking and she used to put her strong points when we had to speak in discussion forum.<br>Then our friendship goes forward with bidding hi's while walking or passing by. Used to find her in prithvi house related competitions mainly<br>1-2 years but I prefered sports over cultural(I am not good too in it..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) so gave my contribution to house in football only.<br>We had good interactions mainly in our chat sessions or 1-2 times assignments related exchange of words be it algo assignment or social <br>entreprenurship syllabus or anything but sometime general too say about her gao...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. She can be seen on orkut checking her horoscope and <br>writing comments on her friends pic,mostly in telugu...<img src=Smileys/2.gif />.Have often heard about her attitude.But I guess she speaks very soft atleast <br>I didn't find any attitude, may be not much interactions.With our chat slows down to zero.Atleast normal hi's are there...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>No worries,all the best for your MS...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=anjaneyavsk.html>anjaneya srinivas</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Anjaneya<br>I never spelled your name correctly anytime but this time I copied your name so I guess its not wrong.<br>He is a cool guy.Whenever I try to crack joke with him or on him,he replies with a very pleasant smile.<br>I had a great interaction with you,regarding assignments or coursework or simple gossips while passing by or in the class.<br>I appreciate your helping nature and your nature is full of innocence. I also appreciate the way you help friends in <br>your group. U might have cracked some good company very early but don't worry bond like you will show results "aaj nahi toh kal"..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>As I always said "You are a bond". So bond, be in contact always and be my friend forever...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Continued...<br>Lots of moments are there of my interaction with you.<br>Cann't pin point all be it on NBH breakfast table, or on road, in wings, in my room in first year, in class where we sit together etc.<br>One thing I like is when u laugh,u laugh in a strange way and I can always laugh by seeing u laughing don't mind dude but my laugh<br>is not the normal one too...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. One more thing I would like to point out is ur jeans that u didn't washed for months.<br>During CAT preparation ur English always inspired me and would like to thank you for the suggestions you gave me.<br>Overall you are a very nice guy,I like the way you discuss things and let we be friends forever dude...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Aniket:<br>Aniket ko dekhtein hi ek hi cheez hamesha dimaag mein aati hai mere and i.e. discussions and confidence. These two words are epitome of a guy who is our Aniket. I could have said he is BC bazz but his BC is more of a discussion and contains kind of formalism.So we should rather say he discusses things than <br>he do BC.Though he do BC too but he is heavy on formar one.He is with me right from Ajmer, where we <br>studied for JEE. Once I saw him smoking outside the insititute,he was the first friend of mine whom<br>I saw smoking,I was shocked that time but after that it was chalta-hai type situation for me.<br>I always see him speaking sth new or sth strange or some incident etc... he always has lot of things in his bag to tell about.<br>One of the astonishing one was when he told me sth about drinking urine ( won't tell much here,I don't remember<br>fully too..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Next comes a girl from our institute. Its very hard to tell you dude that whatever you thought about what<br>she thought of you is wrong...<img src=Smileys/10.gif />, since I know her better..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but its still debatable,you can put your point..<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>Though we both should have been in same batch but we were in the different batch but that didn't matter much and  our interaction<br>continued with me alternating between two batches. Then in college, my gosh, he came out from no where <br>and carved a niche in everyone's heart. He is very good in discussing issues. So what's the big deal here??<br>Deal is his patience and the fact that he is a great listner,he listen to everyone with great care and then put<br>his points. He don't let anyone feel uncomfortable in his company except in some cases when I too became the victim once.<br>In the NBH mess table,with some confusion he started railing against me and was like he don't want to listen to me.<br>This was the first time I saw hyper Aniket. You talk against India or Indian culture or anything like that chances are there<br>( not always necessary) that its time for him to go hyper...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>KAPIL BAJAJ<br>The boy that have inspired me with his quick decision taking abilities....<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I met you because I used to come to GHEB to Atul's room and also we share our Rajasthani bond, so this was how we met and talked to each other.From the very starting he used to be engage with himself not talking to many<br>but confined to his GHEB friends. I sometimes used to say come to NBH there are many people there and he is like<br>"I don't care"...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. No worries he did most of his hard work there in GHEB and then entered NBH and till then <br>he has already carved a niche into people's mind by his coding and technical knowledge. Thanks to somani who must have inspired him and a salute to your hard work. I have always seen you moving forward and learning things without hesitation,<br>for that if you had to take number of projects or different stream of courses or intern or anything you tried all and no <br>wonder your hard work payed to you and gifted you amazon as a job offer. One of the most thrilling thing was when,<br>while I was calling you and you replied from bathroom and when I reached there you were drinking raw egg one by one <br>for your physique sake,I wondered that time how could anyone ( among us) do this and you said that you were inspired by rocky<br>movies <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . I took your help during placement time and I am really thankful to you, you really helped me dude...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>One point that I don't like about you is sometimes ( not always) you do your work and when your work is done you leave your<br>friends when you could help him. But now a days I can see you got some better meanings of friendship...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Its good to see the change from the kam bolne wala gheb guy to the cricket playing,bc karne wala,party mein jaane wala bajaj.<br>I know you are a hard worker and you are also a good judge of which work to take next,keep your good work up and please don't forget me be it for my doubts even...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 4</b><br>Somemore thing which are still fresh in my mind is say when parminder used to come to our room in the night<br>used to sit on ground and then discussion,secondly Pankaj A. used to come and the arguments not the discussion you had <br>with him.The way we used to open the door one by one whenever someone came to our room,with proper understanding ki <br>yeh tera dost hai toh tu kholega else me otherwise one by one...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I loved to know more about your family and bahut sare kisse jo tune sunaye the...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Forgot to tell you that don't forget me ever and ya I will ask questions from you atleast,I love to do so.....<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br>The advices you gave me, I will keep them with me and will work on it be it chewing quietly or asking less questions or change of tone<br>or simply solving problem by myself etc....<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Piece of advice to you : <br>1) Try to look realistic,most of the time, to many people you looks out of world...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>2) Don't be miser now. U can spend some money on your friends too.<br>3) U are bond in study too don't underestimate yourself just work hard sometimes...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>I enjoyed a lot in his company but in baster with proper planning we could have <br>seen that mine too on first day, I don't know why but first time you forgot why we came for and you started doing more bc in the  small <br>weekend vacation where we did more bc than exploring the places that were worth exploring. But anyways that was the best place you chose till now.<br>You became CR,deputy speaker,organised things bla bla I will skip all these since all others have written these things only...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>In the 1-2 years, I always used to tell him again and again with every exam passing by ki read of you own, you will understand concepts well<br>and he was like is baar se khud se hi padunga par whenever next exam came he used to grab his books and notebooks and started searching "ki koi<br>toh padha hi dega". Ek dukh mujhe har exam mein rahta tha ki mein tujhe padha nahi pata tha since mein khud se hi padta tha aur mera last time <br>tak syllabus finish hota tha,aur mujhe har time yeh hi lagta tha ki since I am studying of my own aur mein tujhe padhunga toh mera syllabus ho hi <br>nahi payega....<img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Par mujhe pata tha tujhe koi na koi jaroor pada deta tha toh koi gal nahi but I always insisted ki tu khud se hi padh.<br>Though u know it earlier too but it was during placement time only that u read of your own and I could see you boasting of your OS knowledge and <br>trust me I really liked it...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One thing I like to disclose to you since we are anyway leaving college now is even though so much insipirational<br>work of yours, sad thing is that people used to call them fake many times at your back,reason I found is the way you present them looks very interesting <br>but a bit artificial or fake so instead of getting famous u comes to line of getting infamous for these.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br>My roomie,socha tha teri testi last mein likhunga ache se aur last-last kartein-kartein deadlines aa gayi,<br>thank god I still have time...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. College enter kiya-> room lene gaye-> bala said u cann't stay with raman <br>-> I was like ab kiske saath rahunga -> sanket came from no where -> raman told he is a good guy -> I was <br>skeptical kaisa banda hai,ladai toh nahi karega etc etc... but when he was told ki he can take me as a partner, he didn't <br>thought for a moment and said yes with his ever smiling face.Bhai teri smile ke karan hi haan bol diya tha meine toh.<br>But after interactions and in few meetings I got to know ki he was a right choice baby .. aah ha...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. So this was how me met etc.<br>From the very first year, we were comfortable with each other presence, proper understanding and at the time to compramising things<br>we both were ready...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. As the time past, I got to know that he is different from my normal friends but he used to do most of his work <br>surreptitiously.First year mein sone se pahle kahi baar khoob has has ke sote the,with the great way he used to tell things<br>and we used to share our experiences of kota and all, for me this was like awesome,I love laughing..<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Problem came when we bought<br>woofers and I loved to watch movies. So whenever it was my movie time,it was his sleeping time but no worries I used to <br>take his ear phones, sony wale (jise dene ke pahle woh HAR baar bolta tha bade mange hai dhyaan se...<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and used to watch my movies.<br>1-2 years mein toh woh itna discussions karta tha logo se and aur bula leta tha sabko room pe, so weather I was studying or sleeping or watching movies<br>I had to stop and listen to what was discussion going on, but again no worries aadat pad gayi thi, par dude mere alawa koi aur hota toh pakka<br>tujhe room se nikal deta, but apni understanding toh kuch aisi thi ki kahi tu compromise toh kahi mein compromise karta tha...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Trips toh like, be it munnar,tirupati, bastar or anywhere.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bhana that's what I sometimes call him...<br>Great guy to talk to,hamari mulakat hui jab 1-2 year mein,mein I used to go to gheb to meet Atul and I got to know ki<br>wahan ek aur assignment dene wala bhagwaan rahta hai,bas mulakaat toh honi hi thi...<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bada tense sa dikhta tha us time yeh,waise abhi bhi tense rahta hai kabhi kabhi par ab toh rapchik mast bhi rahta hai many times.Mera<br>interaction toh iske saath mast wala rahta hai,with lots of bad words exchanged<br>mind u not that bad as u might be thinking..<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. His dedication is what I like the most<br>but one more quality is worth appreciable which is his event participating spirit.<br>You can see him in most of the events creating buzz in the campus if not participant<br>then as an audience for sure <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Currently doing his MS but wants to <br>be entreprneur too.Sleeps early, wake up early, go to gym daily, all assignments on <br>time, participate most of the time, plays CZ , SE ka tutor hai, what more you want from a person.<br>Ek baar bas Indic ke exam mein tujhe padaya tha woh bhi pata nahi tu neend mein hi <br>sun raha tha,I know...<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bhana gaata bhi hai,poet bhi hai. In short he can be <br>called as a versatile genius.U r creating a niche in everyone's heart and that's the most<br>admirable quality you have.One more quality, oh my gosh bahut sari hai yaar...<br>as I mentioned u earlier too, like me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> u like to appreciate others work...<img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>Bhai jahan bhi rahe online jaroor rahiyo bahut masti karenge...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Hope u get ur MS soon and u become an entrepreneur soon..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I  will skip ur guitarist, cultural, entrepreneurer, sporty, friendly, gamer, rockstar qualities mentioned in above testis which everyone knows, lemme write some personal observation...<br>Jab first year and mainly second year mein meri kisi assignment mein lagi hui hoti thi .. toh ek hi naam yaad <br>aata tha mujhe,Atul dwivedi...<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> On seeing his helping nature,I used to think many times how can a person be of<br>such a helping nature <img src=Smileys/41.gif />Trust me dude, I was very much inspired by you that time. Over the time I saw him<br>doing different different work learning different different technologies.He has tried his hand far and <br>wide. But lately u depressed me dude with much ur effort in copy paste while u deserve much more according <br>to the hard work you put in <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. Many times I have seen some frustration on your face when you want group to <br>discuss some relevant or news related stuff but the group is doing bc. But everything is chalta hai type these days...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>U looks sometime over ambitious to me,chill down dude,go for one goal at a time as suggested by bhanu to me too..<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>One special quality u have is that you yell at some person and when he reply with the same you become soft at him...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Lots of moments I have shared with you when we had fun mainly BC time,tirupati,CS,room and everywhere, on bike <br>too..<img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Bhai you are among the nice persons I see around so be nice always and let our friendship remains ever...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I will skip his tees designing work,his gymming,sketching and girl friends that<br>most of us referred earlier in the testis.Let me write sth else..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Chacha the name I have given him,now with lots of chacha's around at present it has lost its uniqueness but no worries it is still the same among our friends.I have watched so many movies in his room be it in forward mode .. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> or normal <br>mode ..<img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Be it seeing only good scenes <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> or watching my favourite kaat shaat.<br>He is one of the guy in whose room I have spent much of my time. No doubt he is very helping in nature be it borrowing money or pen-drive or dump-bells or credit card or anything, it is this quality that I have learnt from him. We did our ITWS project<br>together and then middleware project, with everytime same question facing who will give the presentation this time<br>..<img src=Smileys/2.gif />  and many assignments mostly in 2nd and 3rd year that we both copied...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We were together in all the hang-outs in our college life. He was very happy initially<br>but with the past two semesters and now he has become somewhat reserved.<br>My message to you is chill dude and ya everyone around you is good just change ur <br>perception to see them ,this is the lesson I have learnt from Alok.Enjoy the way others like to enjoy don't find faults in them. U r among the very hard workers of our batch with last two sems u r more focussed,all the best for ur <br>CFA and BOA. I enjoyed<br>Your distinct sound making ..<img src=Smileys/24.gif />,<br>"bhool gaya" statements with smile...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Number of quick revisions before exams,<br>The serials we watch in summer vacation(heroes,lost) doing night outs, <br>The sweets you brought from your home,<br>Chocolates you brought.<br>Talk about girl firends<br>The laughs we have while doing tete-e-tete together.<br>And lot more....<br>Lets be good friend for years to come.</b></i></ul><br><br>
