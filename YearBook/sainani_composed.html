<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He works so much, I can't even dream of working so much... while sitting in lab I look forward to get back to my room and he spends most of his day in lab. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>During the discussion about changing system for dual degree students and providing them flexibility and alternate options, Vibhav was the only person to say that since we've signed up for this, we must go through it, focus on our work rather than worry about placements, do good work and not make this dual degree thing look like a punishment for the juniors. I salute you. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>First thing you'll notice about him is his long curly hair jo ki naturally curly hain... logo ne inse inke baalo ka raaz poocha informals mein and he said, main kuch nahi karta hoon, apne aap aise hi grow karte hain, and won the title for best hairstyle! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! oh we're toh staying here only! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He calls me a kid, rather chotu. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> says, bahut maarunga... then says, itna cute hai, bacche jaisa... maarne ka bhi mann nahi karta. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> agar tu itna cute nahi hota toh tujhe bahut maarta...<br>I've seen mahaveer play computer games, sports, doing BC, just strolling but never studying. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He is the only person who told me that an extra year for us in IIIT-H is more of a boon for us, others fail to understand that. He said we have time to properly aim for our goal in life, while others have already taken their first shot in life by joining the company!<br>Looking at him one doesn't have to think two times to decide that he's from Rajasthan.<br>He's a very wise person but prefers to use his wisdom in this he pleases. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! waise hum toh 1 saal abhi yaheen hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>bahut hi cool banda hai chiku... met him a lot during this last year and really loved his company, especially at club 8!!<br>Banda padhta hai, khelta hai aur kaafi BC bhi karta hai... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Have met her only on a few occasions, one while freshers I guess and one while being in the same team in DumbC. But I really admire her for being a good student and also waking up to the call of the need, starting a movement which is on its path for becoming something move. Stories of samvedana are really inspiring. Great work!!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Again forgot... she hails from Bathinda and when I told her I lived there as a kid for 1 year, she seemed to be happy, which I had expected but curiously asked the reason for which she said that she doesn't meet many people from Bathinda... she said we were city buddies! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Oh I forgot about the Google and IIMs... so what's your pick? Really a phodu student !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The only thing I remember about her for first 3 years of my college is her voice, which has been, time and again, resonated by others in a much more shrilly tone.<br>Yeah, she likes to talk, reminds me of Kareena Kapoor of Jab We Met.<br>She's quite a nice girl, we've had some pleasant conversation.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the few girls I've talked to in the batch. Her roll no. is adjacent to mine, hence was my padosi in class and in workspace.<br>As a coincidence, she, Bhanukiran and I (first 3 roll no.s) shared same workspace PC and also joined CDE, each under diff. professor! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>She writes phodu poems, simply awesome... her prowess in handling rhyme is one of the best I've ever seen in an amateur poet. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! But of course we'll be here for 1 more year! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the few geeks in our batch who loves rock music and is known to be or as Aalsi. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I haven't met him but he has this aura that makes one feel that he's the most informed person on this planet. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He reminds me of Egon of Ghostbusters. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Also, I have seen him play phodu TT!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>So many hindi songs have the word, "Chand". Thinking of our Chand in that context creates such hilarious situations which can't be matched. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Anyways, I've interacted very less with Chand but I remember that day in 1st or 2nd year when Chand came to my room and we did a lot of BC about life in general. He said he had experienced drinking, smoking etc. and has gone through some bad experiences and that these experiences have made him wiser than before. I also remember the night when he, Atul, Daddu (I think), and kapil were in my room doing Graphics assignment, we did a lot of BC at that time as well. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He's quite a supportive and understanding person and always stands for the right. When in club 8 someone troubled some girl/lady, Chand seemed perturbed (although he was drunk he was in his senses!) and said that he felt like bashing up that bastard.<br>He's one of the few guys jiske liye meri respect har bar bas badhti hi rehti hai whenever I meet him, like an ever increasing curve. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for the future dude, I'm sure it'll be better but not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>A Disney's fan like me. The first significant thing I remember about him is that he collected movies in DVDs. First time I went to his room was to ask for a movie. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He gave me the DVD, said sambhaal ke handle kariyo. He keeps his DVDs bade pyaar se... good work dude, you inspired me to collect movies in DVDs. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We've had some good conversations in mess during meal time and I still remember your laugh on sometimes some things I say. It was great knowing you.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dharmeet.html>Dharmeet Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>oh I forgot about Samvedana... dude you're doing great work out there... keep up the good work!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dharmeet.html>Dharmeet Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first thing I learnt about him is that he lived in Indore and that he slept early and prayed everyday. Once I attended satsang on occasion of some festival of Sikhs and there he was, singing or speaking (whatever its called) the sabad or bhajans (i hope that's what its' called) and he was doing it real good!<br>I still remember the day when in 1st semester we met one day and he asked me about how my exams had been. I said I was afraid that I'll fail in few courses, but he said, "arre satti toh sabki aa jaayegi, tension mat le." and he was right that I shouldn't worry, but I didn't make it to 7, got 6.91... lol !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I like that cool attitude of his...!!<br>He was one of the first person I'd met in IIIT. He gave me his hard disk's casing to help me figure out problem in my laptop's hard disk! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinav_mehta.html>Abhinav Mehta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Golu aka Abhinav is a sweet guy whose smile can put a smile on one's face. I remember once that we both were together interacting with seniors in 1st week in IIIT. The seniors really liked him and gave him a treat in the end! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He's quite a sensitive guy and once got angry about something that happened in the canteen, i don't remember what but he looked really angry. But apart from that he's quite a calm person and loves to live life his way, not unnecessarily influenced by others!<br>It was great meeting you Golu. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Don't remember when I first met him, but remember his great collection of movies under the name Icshan in DC++. He has spent his life in IIIT, both as a successful downloader, as well as a successful gamer (both online and onfield).<br>He's a great guy, fun loving and a great peer. His friends love him a lot!!<br>I like his freestyle attitude a lot! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Lately I have realized/learnt that he's quite a sensitive person as well. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He loves doing gossip and is a great watcher (I mean movies and TV shows. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ).<br>He used to threaten Mohit for a good grade in DWDM! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vivekprakash.html>Vivek Prakash</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the first people I met and talked to, in IIIT-H. His computer science knowledge and skills are very impressive. He was one of the few people, apart from me, who had some prior computer science and programming knowledge and we<br>used to discuss what we'd learnt in school!<br>We talked about movies, songs etc. I still remember the evening of freshers'05 when Vivek, Atul, Srirang and I were singing 'Dus Bahaane' song a little away from the stage and others were staring at us. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitingupta.html>Nitin Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The word "tha" has been popularly associated with him, so his name turns into NiTHIn GupTHA. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>The first time I met him was as Pankaj's roomie. He tried very hard sometimes to wake Pankaj up, but he didn't wake up. The amazing part is that I lived in his hometown, Alwar for 1 year when I was in 4th class. First time I saw him I was reminded of "Kaa" from Mowgli. I had great time playing corridor cricket with him and others. We often meet in e-sagu lab. I had great time with him in Club 8 when I consumed alcohol in much greater quantity than ever before...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitin.html>Nitin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first time I met him was as Gaurav's roomie. He has really nice sense of humor. First time I saw him I was reminded of the Half-life's main character, Dr. Gordon Freeman. I had great time playing corridor cricket with him and others.<br>We often meet in e-sagu lab. I had great time with him in Club 8 when I consumed alcohol in much greater quantity than ever before...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first person who appreciated my sleeptimedreams blog and suggested me that<br>I watched Heroes! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We used to talk a lot about sitcoms and other things in general.<br>His blogposts are quite witty and wacky, especially that DC++ one.<br>It was during felicity that we made a common friend, DJ Jude.<br>He says I should marry my laptop, lol !! Don't you love your laptop? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankits.html>Ankit Saraswat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He's a brilliant student, an awesome gamer and also likes to watch action cartoons like Dragonball-Z!<br>I didn't interact much with him, but have heard lots of good things about him from others, especially Atul.<br>Once I interacted with him on something about UML and he talked about it in such a way that I could clearly see his intellect !!<br>Also, I heard from section A students that he gave his 100% in lectures, which is great!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>His designs have impressed anyone and everyone who have had the chance to have a look at them. His posters for lit. events were the best I've ever seen. So was the t-shirt design with such a nice design and a great theme!<br>He's quite modest and I've had good time interacting with him. He's a patient fellow and has tolerated me when I've bombarded him with questions on some occasions.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first thing I remember about him is his marks in mathematics in AIEEE were something above 200, which is huge!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>We had some real fun time in workspace when he used to use Nauty's PC in workspace since Nauty was the sole owner of his PC. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I liked his reaction to whatever I said and sometimes he also grabbed my neck for cracking PJ <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Popularly known as Bhalu among his friends, Himank and I have sadly not interacted much, except for few times. I consider him as one of the most consistent bloggers among the good ones I've met and read about. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He's quite an extrovert guy and likes to have fun. The night in club 8, he was so drunk, he was shaking to and fro while paying the bills. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He likes to do a lot of masti and BC.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I remember once I was very sick and he accompanied me to the doctor in Indiranagar. The doctor was thinking of giving me an injection, so he consulted about the same with his father who's a doctor, and then agreed on the injection to be given to me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's the best source for medicine in case anyone needs one urgently at late night!<br>A very nice person, he has helped me and many others with their courses.<br>Congrats and all the best for MS. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>During the initial days I found him as quite an aloof and strange person. Whenever I interacted with him, he spoke only enough words as required! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I got to interact more with him when I took Foundations of Ontological Engg. course under Prof. Navjyoti, with him.<br>As a student, I've always found him quite inquisitive about learning, about the "quest for konwledge". He has always believed and strived for understanding concepts and hence is a great coder. He also takes his sports, soccer, seriously. Once in some course the TA announced timing of tutorial, probably 5pm but this was clashing with his football practice time, so he said so to the TA.<br>Congrats on winning the best allrounder title of the year! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Nice pic BTW. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>His tall, lanky figure and queer noise that he made with his mouth were the first things I remember about him. He was a regular visitor to my room in first and second year, especially between classes when he visited his other friends who lived in my neighborhood.<br>We shared our common liking for chikki and had a lot of chikkis at NBH shop.<br>He helped me many times with problems I faced in linux.<br>We both are equally enthusiastic to attend YOCS sessions and equally lazy not to go till Sec'bad to do so!! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>I love his sense of humor, its too intense sometimes and sometimes so dim that his face and his mannerism makes up for the rest of the humor. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I'll remember the most about this guy is his sense of humor, of course, and his attire, which is mostly a shirt hanging out and jeans, with his bag hanging on his right shoulder, and he walking with a peculiar rhythm in his movements... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Also his style of talking in which he's doing great with his speech, then suddenly he is unable to find a word, he waits, thinks, and then speaks, and yeah the way he drags the words when he speaks them. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=yvsandeep.html>Sandeep Y V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My partner in crime... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I mean as an organizer of the DJ workshop! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Quite an intelligent person... I have had some great time during small chats with him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Quite a pleasant experience.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>First thing I remember of him is that he's good at playing cricket. I met him a lot in my third year when I went to live at his floor. I had good time with him playing corridor cricket.<br>He insisted I be his team mate in Software Engineering and I am glad about that. I had real good time while making the video for the presentation !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Next thing, when we played TT together, he always took me in his team and although I suck at TT, he plays so well that we used to win most of the time! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I really had a good time with you, I'm sure the vice-versa is also true. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for the future, I'm sure it'll be better but not as these college days!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rajatnarang.html>Rajat Narang</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My GHEB ka padosi in 1st year. We are a hi hello friend. We've had some good conversations on dinner table or in corridors of hostel. He's quite a smart and handsome guy and being a delhite reflects in him! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Quite a jovial and pleasant person.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pkbonthala.html>Praveen Kumar Bonthala</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My AI assignments partner and SE partner. He speaks less but once while making presentation, he replied to one of our doubts and it was a pleasant surprise to know he knew more than me and others in our team!<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met him first time when I was in desperate need for help to pass physics I course. Apart from his prowess in physics, his interest in comic books and science fiction was another reason for our discussions on different ideas of possible stories.<br>I really liked his story, SNAP. Hope he writes similar stories or better ones in future.<br>The first time I met this guy, I was reminded of Luke Skywalker as he was wearing similar kind of a shirt with hood.<br>He and Srirang were the coolest roommates I've met. Their room oozes coolness. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And after moving in OBH to 2nd floor wing with Sashidhar, Maruti and Bhargava in the neighborhood, their wing would surely be the coolest one.<br>I remember the various wacky things they did this semester and Sharat's pics.<br>on the rocks kept in facebook. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Frankly speaking I was surprised that he was a native of hyderabad! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Maybe one day we could create a sci-fi graphic novel.<br>What I would like to take from him is his prowess in logic and his wonderful imagination in the domain of science fiction.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>why so serious? @ the pic.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He was one of the few guys who showed his concern over my gloomy expression in first semester. He used to give me advice and suggestions! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Pankaj is one of the multi-talented guys of our batch. He plays sports and acts on stage with equal ease. He's a pro at mimicking anyone he meets a few times or observes for a few times. He's a great thinker and we have talked a lot about life in general a lot !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He used to come from NBH and we used to sit on the steps of GHEB and chat at night.<br>I sometimes wonder why he doesn't participate much in events...<br>He is quite impulsive and loves to get into discussions/arguments, once I got into a long discussion with him but we did manage to find a common ground in the end! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (which is to say I came out of the discussion safely! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My padosi from 1st sem in GHEB. We were adjacent neighbors for first two years in IIIT-H. It had lot of fun troubling him, both intentionally and unintentionally, and see his reaction whenever we interacted.<br>We spent a lot of time chatting in hostel and in classroom. He has been my friend in every semester of the college life, we took many same courses as well. He's a great person but sometimes takes too much stress. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I require a dictionary to decipher his poems! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Seriously dude you write stuff that only experts can read but I know that you put all your emotions and feelings in it, just like any other poet. The theme of and description in your poems is really beautiful, if only I could understand it in first read! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He was my PC partner in workspace as well!<br>He has tried to help me everytime I have asked for his help, be it assignments or lectures.<br>He tells me that everytime I buzz him on gtalk I have a bad news for him... lol !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>You've been a constant part of my life since last 4 years. Thank you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>And congrats, you played a part in my story, "Sleeping in Class" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I don't really know much about Daddu, or Siyar of UG2K5. All my encounters with him have been pleasant.<br>First time I saw him in NBH mess, sitting at the corner position of the table, talking to few of our batchmates, and the manner in which he looked at them and talked was enough to show his Netagiri skills... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He helped me complete my honors project 1 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I'm a BIG fan of, "Daddu ke nuskhe". <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>The batch trip in 2nd year was one of my most memorable moments in my life, and it was he who convinced me a lot to come to the batch trip. Thanks a lot for that. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>The 31st Dec '08 experience was also great, and it was daddu who dealt with the police waalas.<br>He is one of the most skilled people of our batch, the skills which can't be explicitly shown but is quite helpful in one's life. Lol, he's much mature for his age. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Nice speech on the farewell day. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> For obvious reasons... it included my name. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his special ability of knowing how to react to particular situation in a apt manner and managing things...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;<br>All I have learnt from others about Amit Kabra is that he's like a quizmaster, only he doesn't have the answers...<br>Anyways, I've had limited interaction with him, some may say its good but I think its bad especially when I have to write a testimonial for him.<br>I've seen him as someone who works hard, asks many questions and plays soccer or go for a jog and who becomes stubborn sometimes...<br>He sees me as a fattebaaz. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>His walking style is amusing... he swings his hand as done in march past. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I don't feel that he asks too many questions... that could be either because I do have the same questions in my mind and I don't ask or it might be that he's too afraid that I might speak out a fatta that he doesn't ask many questions in my presence. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his ability to ask question when in doubt (on a serious note).<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Paro aka Saarukh, he does give a first impression of a stud but the impression soon fades away when one starts to know the real Paro. I find him quite lazy at times, but that doesn;t stop him from going to the coffee shop.<br>He is someone who likes to live life to the fullest.<br>His short story, 'Green Minds' was totally impressive, I must confess I wasn't expecting such an awesome story from him! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I even decided I'd have him as my partner for writing stories. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>During last summer I joined him and Alok and Atul in their entrepreneurship venture, don't know why, so we had to prepare a report and Paro and I decided to write it after dinner, and when we went to his room (in cellar) to write it, he started videos of hindi songs... I said ki pehle report kar lete hain, lekin paro ko masti chadi hui thi, aur 1 ghante tak hum bas wo gaane dekhte<br>rahe <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>In third year, while staying in 3rd floor, I sometimes went to his room and we talked about our bygone days, it was fun!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>People call him Ganja and so he used to ask me for hair oil many times, all because of those people who call him Ganja.<br>As every other Bihari I've met, Alok is hard working and extremely helpful. (others were also soft spoken, can't say that about him. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )<br>Anyways, Alok has this inner compulsion of helping others, being the good guy.<br>I, and many others, have surely benefitted a lot from it! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Recently when my laptop's hard disk crashed, he allowed me to take his laptop while he rested or was not using (of course he was the first person I asked for it! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ).<br>We met properly in 6th semester when we took DDBMS course together. He helped me a lot with the coding part of the project, but only after 2 days of watching three seasons of the Beauty and the Geek.<br>Well, he also like to do a lot of BC (Baat Cheet) online or onsite. Initially when he joined Vatasal and me for jogging last semester, I thought that he doesn't exercise much so once in a while I used to speed up a bit to get ahead, but he always caught up with me and had enough stamina to overtake me!<br>Sometimes we've had long conversations about life in general and it was fun. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Lately something has got into him and he's not sparing any possible of not cracking a PJ <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> but alas his PJs lack the quality my PJs had. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his helping attitude...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He likes to argue with me sometimes on a level in which I generally speak, during meal time in mess. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>For some unexplainable reason, he reminded me of Akshay Khanna when I interacted with him for first time.<br>I still remember our visit to a company for sponsorship (don't remember the name). He told the representative of that company that I was responsible for the technical decisions and she asked me a few things, sadly I couldn't reply<br>but Karan jumped in and handled the situation. Phew!<br>I made a deal with him that we'd go out for drinks party but I declined later because I fear I might puke. He was quite excited about it though! But I still went to Club 8 and had 5 mugs of beer... he was quite surprised, so was I...<br>chadi hi nahi. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>He is quite an achiever, he's a 9 pointer, a pro at cricket, was the coordinator for felicity and recently got into an IIM, isn't it enough to tell<br>about the awesomeness of this person.<br>Add to it, he's quite a down to earth and helpful and actively takes part or organizes events.

<b>For <a href=yogendra.html>Yogendra Umesh Itankar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I like Yogi's chubby cheeks and round eyes. I remember the night in 2nd semester when he, I<br>and few others were sitting and talking, all of us 6 or 7 pointers. Yogendra said, "ab se dhyaan se padhna padega yar, waise abhi bhi possible hai apni CGPA improve karna, hain naa, maine seniors se poocha tha aur unhoone kahaa tha ki kar sakte hain." and lo! in 2nd semester he became a 9 pointer!<br>He takes efforts to make best use of life, he studies a lot, plays soccer, and also asked me for suggestions on some good books to read, as in literature.<br>He's a hard worker who gives good importance to academics.<br>For some reason, his face reminds me of "Majid Boo" from Dragonball-Z.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>People call him GKB but I fail to understand why.<br>I met him in English Literature class in 3rd semester.

Not that I haven't read thick books, but phir bhi!!<br>In one of our conversations, he told me he preferred to spend his time reading literature and watching TV shows rather than studying because the former interested him more, and that he had done a lot of the former after coming to<br>IIIT.<br>I remember few weeks ago I went to his room and he was watching Supernatural. He started telling me everything about it, and I being interested listened, it was fun!

<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I didn't have the privilege to meet him till 3rd year when I decided to live in NBH 3rd floor. Initially his constant visits to my room (sometimes every hour!) irritated me, but within a couple of weeks I got used to it and often<br>looked forward to it.<br>This guy... phodu gamer... has awesome gaming skills... great shooter, great strategist... never had an honor of playing alongside him or against him.<br>Persuaded me to come to coffee shop with him so many times...<br>I really like his simple honest manner. Although not a personal experience, I heard from others that in a monetary transaction or case of debt, he remembers how much he owes to others, but doesn't bother or seem to remember how much<br>money others owe him.<br>He's one of a kind, so friendly and full of life.<br>Looking at him walk and laugh makes one feel as if one was looking at a small kid. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He's a "Yes man"! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Lol, I remember whenever Gaurav, he, I and others have gone out to have dinner, he always has a soft drink after dinner, either buys it near the place where we had dinner, or comes back to campus and has soft drink. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He was my hi hello friend till before I participated in the photo walk with him this semester.<br>All I knew about him is that he is called Ganja because he got rid of hair on his head and that he plays basketball very well.<br>During the photowalk, he suggested me to take a snap of whatever I found nice. When he saw me standing like a dumb guy taking pictures in a clueless manner he came to me and showed me some nice ways of using the camera while taking a pic.

<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>His determination and perseverence is awesome.

He said it can be done because he had done the same thing for PRK Rao sir's course. He had read intensively and hence got a good grade.<br>He strictly follows a particular diet and never deters from it. He believes in hard work and has helped me on an occasion by lending his utensils to me! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>During our trip to Tirupati when we were climbing stairs upto Tirumala, I got exhausted and gave up after 15 minutes, but he kept on climbing the stairs (what a stamina he has!).

<b>For <a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My first impressions of him was that of a funny guy. He came to GHEB one day and we were talking about people who got "healthy interaction" with seniors and later Atul and I started talking about ghost stories and movies like Raaz.<br>Subroto, unexpectedly decided to sleep in our room because he said he was too afraid to go back. Luckily I had an extra bedding with me. I too fear ghosts, so I can understand how it must have felt, but his situation was quite hilarious, we were asking him to leave and he wasn't leaving! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Since the day we got our marks of ITWS I mid sem 1 and I got highest marks, he pesters me<br>whenever he gets a chance by telling his twisted version of the story to others with delight and satisfaction. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>He reminds me of some funny Bengali character of some funny hindi TV serial, forgot the character. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>His company is always pleasant, lightens up the moment. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Initially I didn't communicate with him because it felt the right thing to do at that time. Later when we started talking, I found that we had a common friend who's my best friend from school days. Although we don't talk much but whatever I have learned about him by observing him from a distance is all obvious... he's hardworking, dedicated, 9 pointer etc. etc. which is good.<br>Himanshu, our common friend sometimes wonder and is amazed by the amount of change that has come in Saurav since school days when he was a mediocre student.<br>He often visited Atul for reading English together, that was the only time I<br>interacted with him in first two years.<br>I had a really good time with him and others in Tirupati last month, which is when I really got to know Khurana better. He initiated the trip and planned it out really well! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Although he is a bit stubborn sometimes, and gets into heated arguments, he does take care of important things and that's what I like about him. I arrived late at the scene when we had to leave for lingampally and board the MMTS, Khurana<br>was obviously bit nervous but was really calm with me and after initial frustration he suggested I have fun after we had boarded the MMTS 1 minute before it left the platform. During the Tirupati trip, he did get perturbed sometimes<br>because of Ninja and Subroto because of their casual and fun attitude and taking snaps at many different places without Khurana. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I don't know why but he looks like a Rajasthani, a person doesn't have to think twice about it.<br>His mannerism is simple and pleasant.

But later I<br>understood why he came to our or any study group, he himself told me that he's not able to stay in his room to study. He likes company of people so he likes studying in a group. I understood him and started liking him even more!<br>He also taught many of us GHEB waalas graphics before the end-semester exam!<br><img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And yeah, he closely resembles Fred Flintstones. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I have always found him in the forefront of campus life, organizing events, talking(chatting <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) with professors, other students, playing BB, strumming guitar (for fun), humming some music, etc. etc. as if living every bit life has to provide.<br>He also does some lively discussion and his mannerism of speaking is such that even the boring monotonous things somehow seem fresh and lively! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He gave me the nickname 'Senu'. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his robust speaking skills!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

It was<br>fun, saw Dhoom2 in black <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> We've also had some music sessions together which was fun.<br>He and Sharat were the coolest roommates I have met. I go to his room and he starts imitating and speaking some dialogues which is quite funny and Sharat laughs his heart out... its a place to be in, always a joyland!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Initially when I saw him and interacted with him, he reminded me of Uday Chopra. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (no offence meant, in case you don't like him!)<br>I remember sharing stage with him during a group dance on two occasions and it was a<br>pleasure. Watching him play tunes of songs for the first time without looking at the notes on a keyboard was also a pleasure and amazing! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I am glad we are in same house, Agni!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I have always enjoyed his company and our latest joint venture was inter-house dumb charades, in which our team (Srirang, Deepti and me) reached till the second round, but it was fun.<br>I don't think I'll ever be able to forget or would want to forget your smiling face, your cool attitude is perfect, not a careless one but the one which gives just one message, "keep smiling and mean it!" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his ability to smile whatever the situation be, and his DJing skills ! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Raul, the other person who helped me pass courses, apart from Atul. Rahul and Atul were famous in GHEB for taking classes and doing assignments in first year, and I benefitted from their efforts! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>One day I asked Rahul, in 4th year, as to why he stopped working hard as he used to do in 1st and 2nd year. He said that he wanted to enjoy the last year after working hard for last 3 years. But perhaps some people's destiny is to work hard, so he's still working hard, taking classes and helping people like me to pass courses.<br>Although he has a peculiar habit of finding the ending of a movie, so as to ensure nothing bad happens in the end, he did suggest me some nice romantic movies, most of which I didn't see though! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I still remember the day we saw<br>Serendipity together, he saw that movie with me for some Nth time only because it had a happy ending!<br>He always accuses me of not keeping my room clean and makes sure his room remains clean and ventilated. Its because of him that I have seen some really good looking faces on internet and in social networking sites. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He calls me Sindhi but has a habit of keeping accounts till the last Rupee... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He had this peculiar habit in 1st two years of sitting beside his room's window and asking any of the passers by he knew to get him something from the coffee shop conveniently visible from his room's window, stretching his arm out of the window with the money between his fingers. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (ok the last part is kind of imagined !!)<br>We have many times talked for hours regarding our future plans and life in general. He says he's very conservative and would only marry in his caste, but I have a hunch that he might compromise when the time comes. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his sincerity, and taking time out to help others.

He was my padosi in GHEB since first year itself.<br>Initially I tried to avoid him because I didn't like his habit of coming to my room and blabbering about what he did the whole day. But whenever I have gone to him for help, he has always helped me, no matter what, if not at that<br>time, then maybe sometime later but he has always helped.<br>He's a hard core Rocky fan. He had and still has this habit or rather liking for singing bollywood romantic songs... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I also admire him for his single minded focus on placements and getting placed in Amazon, along with being a pro in basketball, watching sitcoms and many a times playing AOE with me and others and CZ with many others.<br>I still remember his Michael Jackson moves in a solo dance on stage in freshers '05, partly because I wasn't expecting it to be so good and partly because it was really good !! <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is to get an awesome job inspite of playing so much BB, doing so much BC and watching so many TV shows!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Also, his BCing skills. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met him on my first morning in IIIT-H. Being Army kids, we hit off well, but being totally different personalities, we lacked the compatibility. Then came third year and I got a chance to know GeeKay better.<br>I still remember bothering him to teach me concepts of Algorithms when he strictly refused everyone. He did help me with some parts of the syllabus but explained me his reason for not helping others in academics, which I totally<br>understand and respect.<br>I had good time eating Chinese with him, Rahul and Dandu and because of this I started having soup. We also share common liking for gravy chicken and army life.<br>My interest in music grew because of him, when one day he asked me what kind of music I like and gave me songs of Lifehouse and Switchfoot which are my favorites.<br>He's a BIG fan of Rorschach (I hope that's the spelling!), and named his blog as Rorschach's Journal. Also he has a lovely sense of humor. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Although he's moody and rude at times, (I don't even think of knocking at his door at these times!) he is totally awesome during other times. He's an allrounder, with great insight about things, a sharp mind and self discipline (which includes brushing at night, because of him I resumed this habit of mine, otherwise I'd have lost all my gums by now). He has tried to, a lot of times, help me out of my confusion about some things in life and it has helped me a lot. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I enjoyed my third year a lot being your wingman. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his observational skills, self-discipline and ability to be honest to himself.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is one of the most sincere students I have ever met. Apne kitne saare batchmates ka isne udhaar karaaya hoga, shayad ye bhi nahi jaanta. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He always looks interested in any and every class!!<br>His face reminds me of the cartoon characters Chip and Dale (dude, no offence, but you look cute, hence the connection <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). He is very humble and hard working.<br>Once during a festival of Sikhs, I attended the celebration which included singing the holy songs and shabd (i hope that's what they're called), and I saw Banga taking active part in the whole event, talking about Sikhism and the Gurus, playing table or dholak I think, and singing as well.<br>All the best for the future!!

<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>General Bordeaux... he's someone who scares me sometimes (don't mind! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) because he always seems to speak direct and in a subtle manner, have never managed to argue with him. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> He's a great BCbaaz.<br>On the positive side, he's an extremely nice person... apart from being master of linux, and helping me solve my linux problems, he is also an awesome blogger. His blogs are like him, direct, subtle, simple yet the intended effect can be experienced. I love reading his posts.<br>Also, he's great at gaming, in CZ and AOE.<br>Although you have so many qualities of a nerd, the word "nerd" doesn't suit you... you're General Bordeaux. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Why do they call you chacha, BTW? <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>Looking great in the pic, BTW. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for the future, I'm sure it'd be better though not the same as these college days. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I really like this guy... he is so calm and hard working. He's a great artist, I saw his sketch which got 1st position in Felicity's event for some innovative sketching on some theme and it was so beautiful, quite close to a real photograph taken in black and white.<br>I remember going to him seeking help for some doubt I had in Pattern Recognition... he tried to recall all the concepts and gave me about 20 to 25 minutes before he said he was not able to recall and couldn't help me. I felt really grateful that instead of directly refusing, he took all the possible efforts to help me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>His hometown is Ujjain, the beautiful city of temples where my Maama ji used to live and now my Naani lives there. We talked once about Mahakaaleshwar temple and other temples which I visited once with my Maama ji.<br>What I would like to take from him is his artistic abilities and his silent hard working attitude...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part-II<br>The one thing that made me like Vatasal's company in a crowd is that he doesn't take part in BC, some might find it strange but I find no fun in most of the BC that happens (partially bcoz I don't understand it!), and with all the others doing BC, Vatasal and I sometimes have a private conversation as if we were the only two sitting on that table! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I forgot to mention, he does practice guitar once in a while and plays some tunes accurately, like Zombie, Hotel California, Only Time etc.<br>What I would like to take from him is his awesome artistic abilities and ability to bring major changes in one's life and lifestyle!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part-I<br>His father met my father and me before I met Vatasal. Maybe its because of this that even without proper interaction for first two years, I felt that we know each other, although we still don't.<br>It was from third year that I got a chance to interact with Vatasal, when we took the same HSSM, economics, and read POPL together.<br>His room is quite a contrast to my room. It looks packed with stuff but still smells fresh and clean.<br>His wide range of hobbies surprised me at first, but impressed me since then.<br>Although I didn't know Vatasal very well in first two years, I did find a lot of change in him from 3rd year onwards.<br>We've been jogging buddies for about two months in 7th semester. I saw him follow a controlled diet and attend gym, and the change can be clearly<br>seen. He gave me some valuable tips on healthy diet and lifestyle, although I didn't use them! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He is one of the few people who has rarely refused to come with me to Indiranagar when I had some work. And chatting with him is real fun, he keeps himself informed on various subjects like news from economic times, some health and lifestyle related stuff, movies, literature. He also reads a novel once in a while.<br>He suggested me really good books to read, something that directly falls into my field of interest.<br>His t-shirt designs were impressive and so were his pencil sketches, done with a different kind of technique.<br>I still remember those chocolate balls (they were awesomely tasty, I had 3 of them!!) that he gave me, saying it had lots of calories and that he was avoiding too much of calories and fat! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Once in a while we've talked about ourselves minus our college life, that's when I began to understand him better.<br>He's totally interested in finance and economics and reads economic times everyday... I'm sure you'll do great in your career in finance. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He gave me his camera so that I may be able to go for a photowalk with Shrikant and others, although my pics were really bad. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first thing I learned about him was that he knew karate before I learnt his name! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He is passionate about physics with quantumness in it, and the only person with whom I like to talk about bringing innovation in superhero industry, although our talks haven't reached any conclusion. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>We do discuss our poems with each other sometimes, and sometimes talk about Anime and I watched some suggested by him and they were good.<br>He is passionate about gaming and can spend hours continuously shooting terrorists or managing a civilization and waging a war.<br>He's a BIG fan of Howard Roark and likes to keep himself physically fit.<br>I remember once we were discussing about martial arts and I said that I can not handle pain so I didn't learn martial arts till now, on which he told me what one feels on the first impact of a fist, that everything else feels insignificant, one feels numb and eyes start watering etc. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>On another occasion, I said that if one knows martial arts, one can fight off anyone, on which he said that if you see a man with a gun, run away, martial arts won't work against a gun, must say I had to agree. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I tried to propose new superheroes to him, but he said such superheroes already existed. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> We discussed about time travel, teleportation but since I have hardly read anything about them, so he could, based on his knowledge convince me<br>that I wasn't right or wasn't precise enough! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>For some unknown reason we started interacting quite frequently after coming to OBH, i.e., in<br>4th year.<br>What I would like to take from him is his attitude.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=lvsnpraveen.html>Praveen Bysani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Don't know much about this guy... met him for first time when we took PR project together.

But best part was when he insisted we present on the first day itself... we finally presented on 2nd day, but I got rid of the project sooner because of him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I did piss him off sometimes because I added more work for him but he finished it all. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>It was great doing project with you... it was one of my best experiences with any project partner.<br>All the best for the future, it'd be much better although not the same as these college days!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When genius meets hard work, we get Ajay Somani... he's the youngest student and perhaps the best coder of UG2K5 batch. One of the first persons I met in IIIT, Ajay used to get ticked off at my pessimistic attitude and PJs, and in a<br>squeaky voice used to shout at me, "abe chup ho jaa yaar", "kya BC hai ye" etc.<br>I used to see Somani study on the night before exam and used to come to me for asking the syllabus, be it mid-sem or end-sem! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> After half an hour or 1 hour I found him sleeping in his room, with book lying beside him. Next morning<br>some 1 hour before exam, he used to wake up Atul and asked him to teach. After few exchanges of forbidden words, the lecture session used to start and I used to see Ajay listening attentively, learning everything then and there, and managing to get atleast a B in that course by the end of the semester. This made me think that he's some kind of a mastermind.<br>I had to change my opinion when I witnessed his fast and gradual progress in the coding contests, his session of coding continuously which sometimes used to span a few days. His hard work did pay off.<br>He said he didn't like to study, and I later realized that he liked using his mind to solve problems and make strategy when I saw him playing games like CZ, Unreal etc.<br>What I would like to take from him is his ability to accept challenge and solve problems, make efficient strategies etc. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I didn't want to add this but its important. I admire him for giving up smoking when he realized that it was causing him difficulty while running.<br>I like his hindi poems, some of them are delightful, others are quite an insight. Also, few of his blogposts and his stories are heart touching and quite a masterpiece as far as the conception of the idea is concerned.<br>What I would like to take from him is his open minded outlook towards life and to do jo dil kahe! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I:<br>Being in the same house, I got to interact with Aniket in my first week in college. After the freshers, I didn't get any specific occasion to interact with him because our paths never met. Moreover, he had completely different group of friends. It is quite surprising that I got to interact with him this year and I am quite pleased with it!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Its fun chatting with him about world affairs or arts, poetry in particular.<br>He does have an opinion about everything and is a good speaker. His speaking skills has helped me at times, especially in some courses we took together (read usability engg.). <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> When we had to give a presentation, he started speaking and I didn't interrupt but let him speak. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>It is from last sem when we took cognitive science project together that we have had some good time together and I have got a chance to understand him better as a person and shun his previous image in my mind, and also I got some<br>answers to my speculations about him.<br>In second year he visited my room many times for guitar practice sessions with Atul, which irritated me a lot (partly because of jealousy), and hence his first impressions on my mind was not good. Later I realized that he was quite<br>passionate about whatever he did, be it guitar strumming, or running a marathon, or refining the art of poetry. Now a days we share our interest and have had few interesting sessions, once reading english poetry online for few hours and once reading hindi poetry.<br>Although he gets a bit lazy at times, he's a great person and a great friend.<br>I really am grateful to him for organizing IIIT poetry reading session, Feathers in which I and many other amateur poets got a chance to share their work. He is one of the few people I show my poems as he gives me very valuable feedback on my work.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>MKS Aka Mux, I love his sense of humor, his style of speaking. He would do wonders with stand-up comic acts. I loved his pic with Ghajini hairstyle. His blogposts are a treat only because he puts all his humor and his own style in it.<br>I admire his faith in God and everyday ritual of prayer. I admire him for eating the tomato pan pizza when Akshay and I order 4 pan pizzas. I admire him for allowing Bharat to swap his and my laptop's hard disk to check my hard disk's status.<br>I had great time with him while watching 13B. Both of us were quite scared and were trying to scare each other by imagining various scenarios that maybe I might still be in my room and the person Mux is watching film with, is a ghost, and a vice-versa situation, etc.<br>I still remember the day when he was the first one to take the initiative and tell Jawahar sir that the class time was over.<br>I still remember his first website's homepage where he had kept a photo of Ganesh Ji. This incident made me notice him. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I had great time in his company in Tirupati. He gets really funny sometimes while playing dumb charades, and it witnessed it in our train journey to Tirupati and back.<br>His sense of humor goes to an extreme when he says ki main uska dimaag khaata hoon... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his awesome sense of humor.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akshaysaad.html>Akshay Saad</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Three things I am reminded of when I see his face:<br>1. CS/CZ/AOE<br>2. Sitcoms<br>3. Pizza<br>I don't remember the first time we met but I do remember him staying in our (my and Atul's) room in GHEB for short break between classes (he stayed on 3rd floor). He introduced me to AOE and CZ. He introduced Atul to Tekken (I already knew about Tekken) and we played tekken at night a lot during second year. AOE we played from night till morning, had breakfast, then continued our game till lunch, had lunch... till everyone got bored, went to their rooms and slept, only to start the next day in same way. Had it not been for him, I<br>would not have had those lovely memories of playing computer games on LAN.<br>We do share liking of Sitcoms and pizzas. It is with him that I have had almost all my pizzas in hostel life. Now a days he doesn't greet me with "hi" or "hello", but with "pizza". "toh aaj kitne pizzas khaane hain" is what he starts his conversation with me.<br>His room is one of the neatest rooms I've been to. It gives a sense of freshness, perhaps that's the reason his thinking is so clear and precise.<br>He is one of the sharpest minds I've met in our batch and his strategy making and game playing skills are quite good. Best part is that he is someone who can never irritate me, however hard he tries, although he does behave childishly sometimes!<br>Its fun discussing movie facts with him, and we exchange suggestions on what new can be watched. The scuffling and pushing between him and Maglu, in my wing were quite amusing to watch. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his cool headed attitude and sharp mind, and what I would never take from him is his cool headed attitude and sharp mind! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (it does make sense, it does. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dhingra.html>Hemant Dhingra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Cheerful, full of energy, fun, always found him laughing or in a jolly mood. First thing I<br>remember about him is him finishing 8 out of 10 problems in programming assignment 5 in first semester on the first day itself!<br>He is a movie buff and its fun talking to him about movies. He likes to watch movies in big screen and used to go watch movies almost every week, be it desi bollywood movie, till last year. He is a big fan of Akki and watches all his<br>movies.<br>He likes to talk about the contrast between his life in Delhi to his life in IIIT. We've had some good time chatting about our younger days.<br>He possesses all the good qualities of a Delhite. He is humble and soft spoken.<br>He has smart cool dude looks and likes to experiment on short hair styles.<br>He is awesome when it comes to TT and badminton. He does get quite excited, though, while playing but is a good and honest sportsman.<br>He is quite ambitious and likes to work hard towards his goal or passion, be it reducing his waist size or practicing TT to win the first position (everytime he ended up in second position, except this year!), or towards his<br>future plans! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his jolly mood and cheerful nature.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nauty, one of the few people I met during my first week at IIIT-H. For almost the whole<br>first year, I saw him wearing only full sleeves shirts, then suddenly one day he wore a t-shirt and there was no looking back since that day. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He loves talking about his home place, Garhwal and made me listen to some Garhwali songs (I'm sorry but I couldn't appreciate them because I didn't know what they meant, but the videos were quite interesting and reflected their culture in a subtle way so watching the videos of those songs was a nice experience).<br>In first year, he was my neighbor in workspace and had a speaker in his computer system. So he used to play bollywood songs, some which he liked and some which I liked. He bought a mobile phone with camera in 2nd semester and was one of the first guys in my floor to buy a laptop. His mobile phone has been very useful in 2nd semester and 2nd year. The picture in my yearbook profile has also been taken by his mobile camera. Watched many movies in 2nd semester on his laptop when many of us didn't have a laptop! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He likes to spend quite time with himself and delve into the depths of his thoughts and life in general and sometimes speaks in such a peculiar style, as if he was a philosopher!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I like his sketch jokes and would like him to continue with it. They're roughly made but convey the message in quite a subtle way.<br>What I would like to take from him is love for one's home place.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ahmed.html>Asrar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>First time met him in English class in 1st sem. The only thing I could get from him initially was a sweet smile. Later I realized his friendly nature and intelligence and I often ask him one thing that how does he manage to watch so less (movies and sitcoms) and read so much (news and research papers/books).<br>Contrary to popular beliefs he doesn't study much but he loves reading news articles, its his hobby. A few times I have made him watch Two and a half men and he politely agreed that it was good, he did laugh at few instances but never got addicted to it like I did. He still prefers to watch friends once in a while.<br>I did enjoy after dinner chatting sessions with him, sometimes we were joined by Aniket, in which case the session remained as a serious discussion, sometimes by mohit in which case we all shared few laughs now and then, and sometimes by Dhingra and mohit, in which case we shared some information now and then and mostly<br>laughed and did good amount of BC (Baat Cheet, for the uninformed).<br>He always gives me interesting news articles to read and I show him interesting sitcom episodes, I think its a fine give and take. We often discuss future possibilities in Heroes.<br>I have got some good feedback from him whenever I've discussed my idea with him for a course project or for a research paper, which eventually made me reject the idea. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>Oh, the maggi! He's the one because of which I've had the priviledge of having maggi once in a while in IIIT-H, although his stove is mostly kept in Mohit's room. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>One last thing... He listens to all my crap about my hopeless future and my reasons to do a PhD, or to become a millionaire at 25 and retire at the age of 30, none of which makes any sense but he doesn't complain. Hence, he's a good listener as well, others in this case would not have survived.<br>A very helpful person and a good friend. I only wished you interacted more with people.<br>What I would like to take from him is his interest in world affairs and his ability to not get addicted to watching TV sh</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>There are only two things that I have heard coming out from his mouth... cricket and LTRC.<br>He feels proud to be a part of LTRC (as it seems to me) and shows it quite often.<br>Although he does good work in linguistics I like to pull his leg and undermine his work. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He emits a strange, eerie and disgusting noise which seems to be his special ability to piss me off, I could have killed him for emitting that noise, but had to retaliate by pestering him with<br>other means that I have at my disposal.<br>But on a serious note, he's totally crazy about cricket and loves to talk for hours on it. He's really ambitious about being a researcher, I wish I had that passion about research.<br>Its also fun talking about linguistics with him. He has mammoth capacity in his brain to remember meaning of words, always amazes me !!<br>What I would like to take from him is his willingness to work hard and his passion towards research, and what I would never take from him is his strange, eerie and disgusting noise which he often makes.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is one of the few people I didn't like at first, but slowly I learnt, and others would agree with me, that he's a great guy... banda heera hai heera.<br>But I still can't ignore the reason I disliked him for initially, though the effect has reduced considerably.<br>Anyways, he has a very short reaction time to anything he does, that includes chatting. He is very helpful and if his project partners are such that they won't work (I happened to be such a project partner once!), he does all the work! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He is helpful in general as well and helps others in their projects.<br>He loves python (not the reptile though) and Elisha Cuthbert and Hilary Duff and Britney Spears and Wrestling (the American one) and Australian Cricket Team. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>The long BC (Baat Cheet) with him in which he told me about stories of his life before joining IIIT, and some after joining IIIT which I didn't know, was really good.<br>He proudly talks about Sri Ganganagar, his hometown and stories/things associated with it.<br>He tells me, and I am always amused by it, "research karni hai kya iss movie pe" when he finds me reading about the movie I just saw on wikipedia.<br>He maintains his figure, don't know how but he never seem to put on weight at all, however many pizzas or other fatty stuffs he has. I mistake his bones for abs sometimes! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I admire him for his short reaction time and his confidence (in unknown domains as well, he'll get beaten up but won't feel dejected, rather will keep on working).<br>He says I am the only person because of which he's still using foul language... waise isse irritate karne mein mazaa bahut aata hai!<br>What I would like to take from him is his unconditional confidence, his attitude to say, "just bring it on", without realizing the consequences!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vrktavva.html>Tavva Rajesh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He's a pro at teaching. He took a lecture for me and many others on Theory of society, history and justice. Everyone understood whatever he said and<br>explained. He helped us attempt questions in the exam! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He's a pro at dancing. He is equally awesome in both western and classical dances. His body is quite flexible and he moves his body while dancing with such ease as if it was as simple as walking or talking!<br>I still remember his act of some minister which he often performed in class and in other occasions on request of others, and the way he did it, always made everyone laugh, including the faculty member present there!<br>I also like his soft spoken nature and patience.<br>What I would like to take from him is his special skill of teaching things with such ease that anyone can understand it, and taking out some time to help others as well.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sriharshab.html>Sri Harsha.B</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hey, thanks for the lovely testimonial! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Although I don't know much about him, talking to him has always been pleasant.<br>I remember his presentation in cog sci course last semester and his presentation in Usability engg. course this semester, they were really amusing and I think everyone enjoyed it a lot! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I still remember his "bewarse" video, always puts a smile on my face! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part III:<br>What I would like to take from him is his perseverence and his attitude, and what I would never take is unorganized state of his room! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (my room is still better kept! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br>I know you'll achieve your dreams, and the day you do, I'll be there in the audience, applauding, smiling and happy to be one of the few people to know the whole story of your journey! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part II:<br>I remember three instances when he didn't look back and that's what made a difference.<br>First is when he decided to learn guitar in second sem. He joined guitar classes in summers and practiced everyday (main usse practice karte hue dekhke thak jaata tha, par wo nahi thakta tha). He later decided to start a new IIIT rock band when he came in contact with other talented guys. I had my doubts but he didn't have any of his. I witnessed the result of consistent hard work and perseverence on the rock show night when he performed with his rock band in front of felicity crowd. Second instance was basketball. All he did was play the game everyday and now he's so good at it that he blindly shoots and<br>the ball goes through the basket. Third instance was his attempt to launch a startup. I was a part of the venture initially but dropped later. Atul worked hard at it and finally launched his own startup, although it still needs to be used! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He sometimes regrets that his academic achievements have not been much. Once when he shared this with me, I told him that he had achieved every single thing that any guy ever dreams to achieve as a college student and, well,<br>every girl would like his boyfriend to have, but still can't call Atul stud... sorry dude, can't! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Now the talents, he's a rock star who can play dholak like a pro, founder of Avant Garde<br>about which we all know, a decent artist with colors, a decent singer, a decent basketball<br>player and an awesome friend/social animal.<br>Among his bad qualities, he is lazy, not organized, freaks out sometimes and loses confidence, spends too much time doing BC, first with IIIT friends, then with online friends.<br>Among the good qualities, he's ambitious and has achieved his ambitions of being a part of basketball team and starting a new rock band and has launched his own startup, hence is determined and sincere, is very helpful and is a friend to everyone.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part I:<br>When everyone is stranger to you, choosing a roommate makes no sense. I was lucky enough, as always, to get a roommate like Atul Dwivedi, aka DVD, aka Atal bhai.<br>Had it not been for Atul, mera Mathematics I, II, Physics I, II and Signals and Systems mein paas hona mushkil/impossible ho jaata. He cleared my doubts, wo doubts bhi jo mujhe uske assignment ke solutions mein aate the. He taught me each chapter, sometimes more than once, even after he had taken a class for others! Once I tried to return the favour by teaching him few chapters in Operating Systems but failed miserably. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>I admit I did irritate him when his actions irritated me, like waking up at 6:30 am and going for running (not the PT), playing guitar or playing rock music in room, or watching movie on my laptop while I slept!  But I bow to you for having tolerated a menace like me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I did hate him for many things but I have to admit that had it not been for him, my existence would have been less known. Also, I do have to admit that when later he started going to music room to play music on his new electric guitar (because room was too small for the accessories and the music!), I kind of missed the music he used to play, and his practice sessions... I joined him once when there was an extra guitar in room and we played the theme song of Top Gun by looking at the notes online.<br>Anyways, third year was a different experience when we got a chance to stay alone, but he again stayed close to me, on the same floor. Although a renouned guitar player and a member of parliament by that time, he still was the same Atul whom I had met in first year. Perhaps we shared better understanding when we started living alone in our rooms. We played music together, made few songs, watched GG, Heroes etc. and movies together, did BC (Baat Cheet) more than we used to do in first and second year. I sent him songs I had written, he showed me few new tunes he learnt on guitar...</b></i></ul><br><br>
