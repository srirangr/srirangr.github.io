<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is a real academician. During my preparations of GRE he gave me some wonderful suggestions that really helped me. His ideas of reading The Hindu, the dictionary, NYT etc were really superb. <br>He is the guy converted to dual to pursue his ambitions. Had he sit for placements he would have got into some very nice(high package giving) company but he preferred research over it. Very inspirational indeed <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Now a days you can either see him in room reading some research paper or with Shikha. I guess in the near future he is going to named as Shashank- The know it all man. <br>A hardworking and persistent guy. Recently got selected in to Google Summer of Code. He is happy because he gets the money that he needs for sustenance. Now this attitude of finding a way against all the odds is something I really appreciates. <br>Bhai, dubara se khelna kudna shuru kar do. Khelte rahne se apadhai bhi achi hogi.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Shashank jo ki Agrawal Ji ke naam se bhi jaana aur bulaya jaata hai hamare batch ke un gine-chune logon mein se hain jinhein CSE mili thi lekin phir bhi apni ichchha se dual  mein convert ho gaye <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Bande ka research mein achanak se hi interest jaag gaya aur isne MS karne ki thaan li.<br><br>Sharir se banda dubla-patla sa hai, aur iski bhi body banane ki chaah hai. Uske liye ise har thode din ke baad josh aata hai. Lekin bina ek bhi din gym jaye woh josh thanda bhi ho jaata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I hope ki kisi din teri body banane ki ichchha poori ho jaye <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Padhaai mein banda phodu hai. Aur uska kaaran mujhe EPP ka project iske saath karte huye samajh mein aa gaya tha. Yeh akela tha jisne sahi time par project ke liye kaam karna shuru kiya aur mujhse aur Yogi se bhi karvaya. Kaafi mehnat ki aur uske baad phodu presentation di.<br><br>TT bhi mast khelta hai and to see him smash a ball is a treat. Bahut baar opponents ke liye bhi treat ho jaati hai, jab yeh ball bahar maarta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Aajkal apni girlfriend ke alava inke aur love interests bhi khul kar bahar aa rahe hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Aur us se humein pata chala hai ki yeh Richeek ki taraf kuchh khaas hi attracted hain <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Aur yeh is baat ko kisi se chhupata nahin hai, balki khul kar sabhi ko batata hai aur khushi-khushi ise accept bhi karta <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Agrawal Ji, first year se ab tak inko isi nam se bulata raha hoon, or ye bhi mujhe isi nam se bulate hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> First year main during the C assignments, i came in touch with him. Hamare beech ek ankaha competition chalta rahata tha ki kauan pahle assignment karega or kiska solution jada accha hoga. Wo din hamesha yad rahenge.<br>Vese acades main to banda fodoo hai hi, TT bhi mast khelta hai. Ab kabhi kabhi main ise hara leta hoon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Iska thinking level jara hat ke hai. For exmple he is doing research under Dr. Kanan <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Vese to main bahut kam discussion karta hoon, but jab Agrawal ji ke sath hota hai to maja ata hai kyoonki topic bhi jara hatke hi hote hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Or haan ajamgad ko kese bhool sakte hai <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Best of luck buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Shashank and I were very good friends in the first year. We'd spend a lot of our time together, both as a part of Trailblazers and without it. He is a brilliant and intelligent student, something which was evident in those days too. I remember studying together for some exam.. Don't know which one it was. We had a bit of the competitive spirit, but he came ahead with 9.54 in the first sem, 0.27 more than mine <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Over time, we moved away because of issues and skirmishes. But I'll cherish certain memories, best among them the Dussera outing which we planned and implemented. It was fun to see him dancing and singing that day. He had that josh about it back then, there was always a spring in his step. Hes really mellowed down when you look at him now. I hope there is still that passion and desire to do well in your life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>Wish you all the best for your MS. Good to see you doing your thing.<br><br><b>Fav memory: Leofying him about 'char' <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Message for him: Do not go into your shell.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>part 3</i><br><br>He is the exact opposite of me. To begin with, I like sweet thingys whereas he likes the <i>chatpat</i> and <i>teekhi</i> ones. The person can be as cool as a breeze in any given situation, while I can be a perfect drama queen in the same situation. He can explain any damn thing with an example and logic -when I am struggling to make sense out of what happened ... If he knows what he wants, he perfectly knows how to. I just ask him what I have to do to get this or that. He is a meticulous planner. He does most of the thinking part (for me too) and I the action part!! And yes... he can go on eating as much as he wants without putting on a gram, and I have to measure the amount of water I drink!!<br><br>Looks do deceive..  you should see him eat. He seldom speaks when he eats because he doesn't want to be 'disturbed' <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> - that is when I do most of the talking. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br> <br>He is a very simple guy. We all know that though. The kid thinks a lot and I sometimes worry that he is going to shed all his hair before he turns 25. He gets cranky when I call him cute, sweet, et al and complains he is not. It is a boy thing! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He thinks a lot about all the things he reads (which IS a LOT), about the things I speak, about the days gone by, about others... and so on.<br><br>He was my wonder-man during placements. Those were tough times and thanks for being there every day! You made it a lot easier.  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He can be crazy at times and damn serious at other times. Kid 'adores' Chandler Bing from Friends and tries to emulate him a lot. When we talk, our talks mostly consist of either his problems (no, no... not any other problems but graph theory or some likewise topic that he might be reading <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), or we are mostly discussing some scene from FRIENDS and narrating its dialogues.<br><br>By the by, he's a very good actor! He 'thinks' he sings very well... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> he sings better than me though!<br><br>Yeah ... he is my lucky charm.<br><br>Kiddo .. you are the best.. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>part 2</i><br><br>Till my first year in graduation, I used to lose marks in exams because I lacked the skill to write exams. Yep, he told me writing an exam is also a skill. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> He used to see my answer scripts when they were distributed and see where I lost marks. He would later give me feedback what I could have written or how I could improve. And I'll say I never looked back! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>He encourages me into doing 'anything' I wish to. He makes sure I am clear on why I want to do something. From my first year itself, I dreamed of working for a company 'X'. It always felt like a distant dream. I know without him I wouldn't have ever made it to 'X'. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We had so many sessions of pressing our heads together for some problems <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> - the races to see who would solve first, distracting each other so that the other won't be able to think, the teasing after one solved, the comparison of results... I'll miss those times!<br><br>This boy-next-door is a 'bond'. He testified this when he scored 90/90 and 150/150 in C... and keeps reminding me again and again. Oh, by-the-by, he studies one day before the exams just like me and you. His achievements stand aloud and distinct... but he maintains a simple, helping and humble demeanor.  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He has always been so patient to discuss all my trivial problems, to listen to all the things I have to say (to anyone in the world) - which by the way, I too know, is a lot. Thanks buddy!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>part 1</i><br><br>On my first day of college, after our 'English test' in room 305, a list was put up outside - listing our roll nos. As I found my name, I wanted to see who will be sitting beside me in classes for the next 4 years. There it was - Shashank Agrawal - one of them. 'Agrawal' ... "interesting" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>On our first day of classes, he was seated in his seat before me. I occupied my seat and we just smiled at each other. We didn't talk that day. He is a shy guy. Next day, bored of being silent for so long, I asked him his name, ranks, etc. We started talking about studies et al. I thought -  I can speak now at anytime - even if he is not talking. But apparently, he was interested in everything I did/talked about!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I remember this particular day - the C-assignment deadline was approaching and I was facing a small error in one of my codes. I might have talked to him in class about it and asked him to look into it. Later that day, during our C lab session, I got about an hour late and he was so sweet to linger on in lab for that whole time - even though only 2-3 students were left behind. When I started to leave, he came to me and said that I asked him to check my code... As I was feeling hungry, I said - I'll see .. but he insisted on checking it after lunch and I had to go to lab. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I am not going to reveal all the incidents here because I use them to tease him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and sometimes to blackmail him!! It has been such a long time since then, and still I don't think I can follow his trail of thought. </b></i></ul><br><br>
