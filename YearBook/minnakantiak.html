<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>amoo baboi .. the only guy who speaks in telugu in front of me even though he knows that Its really difficult for me to speak <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... thanks to him I kind of started talking in telugu <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... All the best for MS in US .. <br><br>Will miss you for all the birayni outings in 3rd year <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My BTP partner. A big a**hole. Never did anything. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Once I asked him to write a report and he sent me a few lines from some site and thats it. No more no less. He used to call me <b>only</b> on the day of Viva and I used to make the first few slides exclusively for him. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Well, these things are common in BTech life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and that won;t decide anyone's character.<br><br>I've known this guy from inter 1st year. Back then he was the mathematics wizard. A very fodu guy in chemistry too. But after coming to IIIT, due to some circumstances, he is whatever he is today. But I'm still proud of your mathematical skills and a big hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> for them.<br><br>A big movie freak. I still remember as if it were yesterday that we were going out to some theatre in Vijaywada <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> to watch the latest film on the day of IPE math exam giving the lame excuse of hair-cut <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and laxmi srinivas agreed <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>He might not turn up for any, literally any, college event (not even felicity) but there is more than 100% chance of him of coming to any cricket match being held here in IIIT. He's crazy about cricket. Even in inter days, our neightbours used to put on cricket on TV and that TV was visible from only and only my room. Ajay was the first one to run away from study hours and then wait till my room got opened and be the first one to watch the match. Thats some craze dude. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your cricket craze.<br><br>So there goes a testimonial for an old friend who was at first not willing to create his profile on yearbook. All the best for your MS in US <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Hope you do MS under a prof who is someone better than Ramu and make your MS a useful one.<br><br>Love<br>Srirang.</b></i></ul><br><br>
