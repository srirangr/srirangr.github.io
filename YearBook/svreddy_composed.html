<br>
<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=kiranm.html>Kiran matam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>There is one guy in our batch who laughs for anything and everything. And he is so famous at that that he's called with a nick which has "laughing" preceded to his name. It seems his portrait is the correct replacement to <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> smileys. And, that, ladies and gentlemen, is Laughing Kiran alias Kirku alias Matamaiah alias Mabbugadu alias Cloud Boy alias Despo Kiran.<br><br>He's a concoction of a hard-working and a talented guy you could rarely find. He's been shortlisted for interviews for more than quarter century of companies in our placements<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Do I need to say anything about it? Perfint Tech should be damn lucky to hire this "kasi" guy for such a low pay. Unlike other guys in our batch who do projects and assignments just for the sake of it, he's a real researcher -- whom IIIT-H should be proud of.<br><br>One could easily mistaken him for an innocent, calm and innocuous guy judging by his looks and the way he talks. There is another angle to him other than this; that only we know -- his "despo" angle. That "milk joke" you and Goti have cracked is a testimony to your "despo"ism. The way you cursed your late grandfather for not doing your marriage was awesome. Wait for some more years dude... don't be too eager, anxious and desperate to get married and dash-dash-dash!<br><br>I couldn't and won't forget the way you (in collaboration <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> with Goti and Ram) entertained us in NBH mess all these days<img src=Smileys/3.gif />. The 3rd sem in which we (Sana, You, Pappa and I) used to read dash-dash-dash stories were the awesome-est moments I spent in GHEB. Wish those days come back again. And the dialogue "maa pappa eppudoo room lone untadu!"<img src=Smileys/21.gif />, the "annayyaki gnanodayam"<img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and the "good morning teacher"<img src=Smileys/24.gif /> episodes!! I'll never forget in my life. <br><br>All the best for your future ra...<br><br>PS1: When are you going to propose your <i>paapa</i> dood? Do it at the earliest without delaying any further!<br>PS2: You're my favorite pillion ra!<br>PS3: Gadwal sambandham yedivaraku ochindi?</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vsatish.html>Satish Varagani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>There are very few people in IIIT who I haven't seen becoming angry. Satish is one of them<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>He's <b>very very very very kind at heart</b>, innocent, caring and calm guy who gives great value to friendship than anything else. Don't remember how many discussions we had in our wing on countless number of topics (especially girls <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>You still remember<br>-the day when you made a blank call to a girl? <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>-the cog sci presentation in which you've signalled a student for almost 2 mins instead of clearing his doubt.<br><br>You won't even notice how time passes by when you're with him. He can drag you into any discussion even if you're not interested in it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He's also a great fan of NTR and Telugu Desam. Have the habit of watching his movies on the first day itself.<br><br>He's a hard-working guy -- published two research papers in international conferences. Should I say anything more about it? <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Also, very good at math.<br><br>All the best for your future. Hope we meet again at some IIM and have gala time (preferably as wing mates<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). Now onwards, I won't have a caring friend like you as a wingie <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Miss you ra... You've got that wonderful smile. Keep smiling <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Be what you're...<br><br>So, when shall we party again<img src=Smileys/4.gif />? Ardhamaindanukunta?<img src=Smileys/3.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Ardhamaindanukunta?<img src=Smileys/3.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=marepallybhanu.html>M.Bhanu Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If there is any body builder in our batch who is decent enough (most of the time) to be called as a body builder, unlike Bodi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, that is Bhanu. We also call him Gym Bhanu or Bun Bhanu (he used to be famous for having 3-4 buns a day in GHEB) or Physics Bhanu (infamous for registering for a course under Mukku which unfortunately has only 4 students).<br><br>Manchitananni, punctualityni, superstitionni baaga mix chesi, kaasepu oven lo bake chesi, oka manishi roopam lo tayaru chesi, daaniki padhatulu nerpinchi, daanni rojoo gym ki pampinchi baaga workout cheyisthe mana Bhanu taayarayyadu. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>He's an avid gamer. Plays almost all the games that our downloaders download and is very good in CS. I don't know whether punctuality is Bhanu or Bhanu is punctuality. That punctual he is. Proud to have a friend like him.<br><br>He's one of the 12 "mess" friends without whom  NBH mess seems lifeless. All the best for your future raa... Babye. We'll hopefully meet in some IIM. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bodicharla.html>Hari krishna</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hari alias Bodi alias Alex a.k.a Haranath Policherla is notorious for his laziness, forgetfulness, OA and dirty maintaining of his room and himself <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>As soon as you start tending to jump to the conclusion that he's a macho young man after seeing his "gym" body, his actions, hair style and especially his OA will negate them <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . He's got a damn funny hair (if you call that thing hair <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) and an awesome sense of humour which is so extreme that he'll make others laugh even by cracking jokes on himself <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Keep it up! He does mimicry of Super Star Krishna so well so that it doesn't seem to be mimicry any more <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Those two weeks when we used to do baat-cheet in Shashank's room in the name of rehearsal for the skit were among the finest moments I've spent in our 4th year. I wish those days come back again...<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Watching Billa with you was a great experience. When everyone were getting bored with all the crap, you entertained us more than the movie. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>You don't even notice how time passes by when you are with him. Being a comedian in our batch, always keeps entertaining us for hours together with his peculiar and funny Kadapa accent <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>All in all, he's a great person to be with, a jolly friend to spend time with and a funny guy to laugh at.<br><br>All the best for your future... Be what you are. Your smile and sense of humour are your biggest assets. Never lose them. Do keep in touch. Do come to Hyderabad once in a while. Otherwise, you'll remain as a village boy.<br><br>PS1: Sorry ra... Testimonials are supposed to mention truth <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>PS2: Body penchadame okkate saripodu ra bodi gaa.. inka chaala kaavali<br><br>PS3: eeNa meeNa dicKa.. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksana.html>sana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Only one adjective suffices for describing this guy -- "Kasi". But there is more to him than meets the eye. Also called as "potti" sana, "sheik" sana, "SHIT" sana, "kasi" sana, "pee kay" sana, "shetty" sana, "item" sana and "kasi" ____a, he is an ideal child any parent would crave for, an obedient student any professor would search for, a friendly friend any friend would wait for and a trust-worthy lover any girl would die for. And believe me, I'm not exaggerating. Ladies and gentlemen, lemme introduce to you a great friend of mine and my roomie in IIIT-H for more than two years, THE GREAT Sana alias Pradeep Kumar Sana. <br><br>Being a very stubborn guy, no body dares to argue with him or tries to talk with him when he's in an argument with other person. He tries to win any argument, by hook or crook. And in the process becomes an "item" (that's a different story altogether <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). He's one helluva hard-working and sentimental guy you could ever come across in the 21st century. Aggravating it further, he is a vegetarian for 4 days of the week <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Praying god for 10 mins daily, going to temple weekly, fasting monthly, wearing only one pair of clothes (read lucky/sentimental) to all the exams are few acts that make him seem an alien to our college <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. And in spite of all these, within very less time you'll become so attached with him and addicted with his friendship that it's difficult to part with even if you wish to (I won't <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Being a room mate to him for 2 yrs without any issues is a testimony to that.<br><br>I don't know how many times we teased him using his hometown's (Seekakulam <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) name, his height and his project under M.B. but he never lost his cool. Keep it up dude!<br><br>He's very good at academics <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> and at the same time a very good cricket player (and a captain too), actor (we won't forget the Rajni's fight sequence in skit) and stuntman <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . <br><br>You've got an amazing smile. Keep smiling!! All the best for your MS ra. Be what you are. Hope you divorce with M.B. and get out of this place asap.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vvchaitanya.html>V.V.Chaitanya Krishna</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 2:<br>=======<br><br>Though he doesn't seem so, he is very very big "kasi". He's very talented and a hard-worker (a rare combination), very good at math. The devotion and commitment with which he does his projects, CAT preparation and BTP is simply amazing and exemplary. Yahoo and Hadoop needs a guy like you dood... <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. I envy you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>I hope you still remember those days when we use to rag juniors. Esp in 4-1 sem we used to gather in your room and discuss about ____ for hours together. Though we don't do it anymore, I've learnt a lot from you in those days. <br><br>You'll be among the very few friends of my life I'll never ever forget. Great to have a friend like you ra... Next year IIM-A lo neetho paatu naaku seat thechukovalannade naa aasha! Enchakka kalisi biryani tinochu. Don't know how I could live without a good friend like you after leaving the college. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Wishing you good luck. This is Vikas a.k.a. weakass signing off.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vvchaitanya.html>V.V.Chaitanya Krishna</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Part 1:<br>=======<br><br>Writing a testimonial isn't easy. And when you decided to do it for this guy, there are so many things you could possibly write about that choosing the right ones and restricting to 3000 characters (readable) is very difficult. So, here it goes -- in two parts.<br><br>This guy's name is Chaitanya Krishna OR Chinni Krishna (in his childhood days). The word "krishna" is included in both the names. And rightfully so. For, it is evident from the way he flirts girls (though only in Orkut and Chatting). He's also called as "Vasana" VV or "Despo" VV or simply VV by us.<br><br>His day in IIIT-H starts after I wake him up for breakfast. Brushes his teeth for one hr, combs his hair for 1 hr and wearing sandals takes another 1/2 hr. He cracks very foul smelling jokes/counters justifying his nick "vasana". I don't know how many times Rama, Goti, Sha2 and I made fun of him in mess but you didn't lose your cool. Always tries to make sure that his nick "vasana" is apt for him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> You won't get bored when you are with him -- keeps on talking about something or the other. Analyzing other people especially girls is what he does all the time. And a pretty good one at that. This word "vasana" is so closely associated with him that he could literally see smell (or sniff at) and tell the bio-data of any girl. Always keeps himself up-to-date with current affairs, literally <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Kilometer dooram nunchi kooda despo ani pilisthe palukuthadu ee "pichi naa xxxxx". He's a loveguru. Or so does he think of himself? Half of the time you'll find him singing sentimental telugu songs which, obviously, is very irritating. Photollo choosi sambar lo kaalu veyyakandi... veedu pedda kantri gadu. Overall, a very friendly, helping, trust-worthy, hard-working and funny friend you'll become so addicted that you can't live without.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samantapudi.html>S.Rama Krishna Raju</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Raju alias Samantapudi alias Raju bhai  is one hell of a studious/kasi guy. He's been suffering Multiple-personality Disorder since many years . His various personalities include<br><br>1) One, that surfaces as soon as he faces a camera giving numerous facial expressions than any living being on our planet can.<br>2) Second, while in an argument. He has the ability to argue and convince any person that his opinion is right (which in many cases is not).<br>3) Third, which springs up when he's in study mood.<br>4) Fourth, which comes out when he starts to crack stupid jokes/counters on others which, literally, don't have any meaningful meaning. And, in the process, making himself an "item".<br>5) Fifth is of an "angry young man" when he starts to quarrel with others.<br>6) And the sixth one activates when ragging juniors.<br><br>Our first acquaintance was in 2nd year (S&S) class Hey, do you still remember that incident?<br>With all that said, I'd like to conclude saying that he's a very good friend of mine god gave me whom I can share all secrets with. And some adjectives to describe him are friendly, trustworthy, kind, lazy, etc., 	</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nvkartheek.html>MNV Kartheek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He's one of the persons in our batch for whom the nick name I've invented has become so popular that people began calling him with that dirty nick and to an extent that many don't even know his original name (I'm exaggerating <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). We call him Kartheek or Kar"thick" or "lathika" or "M" thati or M___ thati or simply M____. Kindly excuse me for not filling in the blanks -- due to censor reasons.<br><br>There, in fact, are many adjectives with which one can describe this guy. "super kasi" being the prominent one. Needless to say, he's very good at studies. He plays every sport very well and is very good at football.<br><br>We share many opinions and interests especially trying out new linux distros on our laptops weekly. Always eager for crazy conversations and arguments. To put it in a nutshell, he's a geek. That one word is enough to describe him. The way he analyses everything, the depth to which he thinks about anything is truly amazing. <br><br>Hey, you still remember the day during 1st year endsems when we watched Naa Autograph and began calling each other "Lathika" <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Those were one of the memorable moments we spent in IIIT-H.<br><br>Lucky to have a friend like you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and be what you are. Aa smile eppudu alaane undani. Ade neeku andam. Coffeelu taagadam koncham tagginchuko ra kanna...inka nallaga ayipothav. Ippatike nee mokham lo kallu, pallu tappa emi kanipinchav! <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Hope you ECD guys come out of IIIT-H atleast after 6 years... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Haa... ostha raa mee Sathupally ki o roju ninnu saavagottadaniki. All the best for your future. Please do invite me for your thesis presentation. Naakem ardham kaadu.. ayina vastha <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Nuvvu jeevitham lo unnata shikaralanu adirohinchalani aashisthoo this is ur Vikky / Vikas / Weakass signing off....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kranthi or Kantri or Kanthru are few names I call him with. A very friendly and calm (at times) person who is very good at studies and sports especially in Cricket. He's the best batsman and captain IIIT-H has ever seen. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Very good at organizing events. Takes good care of his health, does meditation daily.<br><br>Glad that you still remember those 1st year days especially the day before EC exam. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We share many interests and yet are very different. Appudu (1st year lo) baaga lite gallalaaga undevallam. Ippudentra antha kasigadilaaga maripoyav nannu ontari vaadini chesi...<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>I want to see you again in the hairstyle that you were in 2nd year. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Ee madhyala aa body oti build chesav gym ki velli.

All the best for your thesis and future. I wish you reach great heights (not literally) in Cricket and acads.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;<br>"Yo Pro -- We Pro" <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br>Now before you start wondering what this stupid thing is and jumping to any meaningful conclusion, lemme tell you my dear friends, there are umpteen such seemingly stupid yet funny and addictive one liners uttered by this guy everyday which literally have no meaning.<br><br>Ram Reddy alias Ram a.k.a Remo Reddy a.k.a Banda Reddy is one of my very close friends who values friendship more than anything else in this world. A very talented, helpful, lazy, unpunctual and, dare I say, dirty guy but very kind at heart. He's very good at all sports especially football. We share many interests like passion for bikes and food. One thing I like about him is he never says no to anything asked; be it movie/restaurant/trip unless he's got an appointment with his favorite professor Anoop. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Always stays ahead when doing crazy things and teasing others with his slang.<br><br>He's the only person, as far as I know, who can counter "Counters" Goutham seamlessly breaking the monotony. And a very good one at that. Or so does it seem?<br><br>Be what you are and all the best for your thesis and future. Do invite me when you present your thesis. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shashankl.html>shashank lagishetty</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Well, to begin with, I happened to meet this guy nearly 3.5 yrs back in our hostel. From then we became very close and I never used to go to class/mess/anywhere without him.<br><br>He's a very punctual, perfectly systematic and  intelligent guy (most of the time) who does what he is supposed to do all the time. Being exceptionally good at studies, he's the one in our friends' circle visited by most of us before assignment deadlines and examinations. A very cool guy to hang out with who appear to listen to your every word and laugh at every joke you crack.<br><br>He cares about his so-called glamor, hair and health than anything else our planet has to offer. Whether his reply is yes or no, he keeps nodding his head for everything anyone asks. He's very popular for his Bus Conductor joke and ever changing peculiar status messages.<br><br>All the best for your honeymoon with Bezawada and hope you two will come up with a very good thesis after an year or a couple.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=svimjam.html>Srikanth vimjam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>There are very few people in our college who have the habit of reading Economic Times daily exhaustively without even leaving the advertisements! There are even fewer people who can read articles on Economics and Recession/Global-slowdown from webpages that even Google fails to crawl <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. There is even a subset of people among them who tries to apply all the knowledge thus acquired on real life situations and to teach others. Needless to say, our Vimjam is one among that subset of people. And thankfully, he's the only one. It is no-brainer that he rightfully got a Professor job.<br><br>All the time, you either find him bragging about his hometown Narsaraopet or sharing his newly acquired knowledge with friends and strangers alike which he thinks they aren't aware of (but the actual truth is he's the last person to get to know!<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ).<br><br>Now-a-days, making promises and going back on one's word has become a fashion. Our Vimjam has already caught up in with it. Another talent that he, and only he, possess is to crack a joke just to find out that he's the only person laughing (or appear to be!).<br><br>And in spite of all these, Vimjam remains one of the best friends of mine whom I can share any secrets with and at the same time being a comedian who makes fun of himself to make others laugh.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Gopal, Gopavaram, Gopalapuram...<br>baagundi roy nee address<br>"all the summers"aa? em chesav ra appudu? summer motham projectlu chesuntav! anthe kada?<br>Hmm.. to say few words about you, Gopal alias Goki is a kind hearted person per se who values friendship than anything else. All the best ra mama. nee Ph.D tondaraga raavalani korukuntoo nee Vikas</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hmm... instead of writing testimonials like this about our beloved Anantha Krishna Karthik a.k.a AK, one can really write a book or a research paper (if he/she could!). A.K., though stands for Anantha Krishna, can also be read "Athi Kasi". And rightly so. He's one of the punctual persons I've ever seen in my life. A very good friend of mine; whom I can trust every time. Though he looks very serious, he's very funny, kind-hearted and one helluva kind person.</b></i></ul><br><br>
