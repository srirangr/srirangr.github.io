<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>someone asked me a question, "who will you admire in our batch?" and my answer was ... this lad - jaat, sindi. If there is some meaning to the term 'bond' .. he totally justifies it. Great acads, great placement, great attitude towards anything, a very nice TT player. But this is not just what sindi is .. he is a friend you'll regret not knowing. BC to chahe jitni karwa lo .. always ready ... phatte ka jo level hai .. wo sirf main hi match kar pata hu ... and when we're together .. log paagal ho jate hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We've had quite some laughter sessions at my room .. dono 1-dusre ke phatte ko bura bolenge aur phir dono hi pet pakad pakad kar hasenge <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. that was fun.<br>This guy is always ready to help anyone.. has taught OS so many times and to so many people that he can tell you topics by pagenumber .. and seriousli all through my MS interview I was thanking him for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>There are manythings that people have written like never say die attitude, always wants to be best at everything he does .. so I dont want to repeat it. He has done everything in college life ... after getting placed he went to synthesizer class, played VB, played TT, played CZ .. and did whatever he was losing while studying .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. great job buddy.<br>Message for him : I know you wont forget me ... so nothing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Song for him: Rock on!!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mathur is a guy who can do BC with any group in college. You can find him playing cricket woth LTRC, playing VB,CZ or very rarely .. working <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Ise yahan par LTRC ne pala hai .. chaddi baniyan tak ke paise diye hue hain .. but ab shayad sautela ho gaya hai .. tabhi paise nahi mil rahe hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>My yuktahar buddy .. bahut BC kari hai yuktahar aate-jaate.

<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This guy is a gem. One of my closest and earliest friends in IIIT. In second sem we used to do a lot of BC in his room .. that was on hell of a time we spent together. But later for some reason we came apart .. but like that matter. We're still close friends.<br>All 4 years have been memorable with him. But some of the best memories are of at the time we prepared for placements. He used to come to my room and ask doubts while I used to watch friends <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. I had stickers in my room to keep studying, to concentrate .. and when I watched movies he used to point at that taaki main line par aa jau. Isne bahut bar mujhe gym jane ke liye inspire kia hai ... but aalsi as I am <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.<br>Bangalore wouldn't have been awesome without him. Every friday I used to get a call just telling me the place I had to be .. no questions asked .. and I liked that .. even though main har movie jane ke pehle bahut rota tha ki paise nahi hain ... but eventually we ended up watching every damn movie in theatre <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Buddy, you've also inspired me by the sportsman spirit you showed at various incidents in college or in our group. I 'll always remember you for that.<br><br>In the end, It has been a great time we spent together. And all the best for pune ... hope you get your dreamgirl there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Love,<br>Piyush</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=khatri.html>Gaurank Khatri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Khatri is one of my earliest friends in IIIT. In first sem we used to do a lot of BC in his room. In fact I used to stay in his room all day and night and use my room only for the necessities like sleeping. It was a great time we had that sem.<br>But, the best memory isn't the one back then .. In second sem I somehow separated from the group and found some other friends. But Then came the summer after 3rd sem. Madu, Pappu, Pado and khatri were there in MS and that was a period of a lifetime we spent together. This guy, I must say, is a laugh riot when he starts talking. You can leave him in a city alone without any money .. and he will come back just by the power of his mouth. A big-Big-BIG fan of hindi movies. Has many of shahrukh 'stuff' stored in his lappy. The physique does not tell a correct story about him .. he looks like a monster .. but is a nice guy who can watch sarkar-raj 3 times just for a girl <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Bangalore wouldn't have been that awesome without him .. buddy .. I still miss the bangalore time ..<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Song for you: Golmal hai bhai sab golmal hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Message for you: Keep talking<br>Best Memory: Do I need to mention ... Bangalore!!<br><br>All the best <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Felicity 2008 .. a mail comes 'the video is ready for a demo to design team' .. and when I saw it .. I was watching with my mouth all open .. It was AWESOME!! Ans the brain child behint it was none other that the lean guy next door. One of the best designers of our batch .. and I have been greatly impressed by his designs .. It has been my problem of 'ego-clashing' .. but hell you 've done a great job <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Buddy Keep up the good work .. and call me IF EVER you need some help <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Best memory: all the discussions(read fights) while designing for felicity'08</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This guy is a real gem!! you don't find many like him .. before 4th year we never had much interaction .. considering the fact that I was not involved in those booze sessions .. and I really regret not knowing him better. But in 4th year when I shifted to his wing .. we had a lot of BC sessions in our wing .. or in any of the rooms .. the TT sessions were awesome.<br>This guy approaches anything that comes to his way with such an attitude that there is no way anything can stop him (other than his aalas <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) to accomplish that, which was evident when the PPO interview at MS was just a formality in his case. A 'Good-mix' of humble, geek, smart, confident and pool of knowledge. I am damn impressed by his knowledge about anything to everything .. a mobile wikipedia as we say <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>This guy has been stereotyped as aalsi in our group .. but the effort he has put in for the placements is more than commendable. He has worked day and night for the placement season. Also he has helped many of us with tutes on algos and any doubts we had regarding C/C++/DS while preparing for placements.<br>Buddy m glad you're in hyd .. 'coz I think I need to learn a lot from you.<br><br>Best Memory: MS and Amazon interview time and TT sessions <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Msg for him: Let me drive your Lamborghini <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ye banda heera hai heera ... Sarukh ka fan hai .. baniyan me ghumta hai .. nahata nahi hai .. gym jata hai .. aur wahan jakar BC karta hai .. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I came to know pado while my bangalore stay last summer. And buddy truly .. It couldn't have been that awesome had it not been for all the leofying session of yours .. and you taking all of them sportingly <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. a nice guy .. a little impulsive .. have a good physique but jab muh kholta hai to sab barbad <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. I have heard from all the pther interns at MS last year that he works hard ... but never seen him working myself <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. ise chai peene ka bada shauk hai .. I remember that hunt for a chaiwala at thippasandra at 4 O'clock in the night ..<br>Buddy .. You're a nice person .. a good friend to have .. and I appreciate your spirit to take all those leofying sessions sportingly <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Best Memory: Bangalore Stay<br><br>Message: Chak de phatte!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Adi .. He was my room-mate in first year. Although I rarely stayed in the room for the whole first year .. there was a clean separation in our room .. his side was clean like anything .. you will see even his napkin folded nicely beside his pillow <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... and my side was as messy as it can be. But seriousli ... this guy never complained ... atleast not in front of me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Newaz, hes a nice guy to be with .. does workout daily and has got a good shape .. kewl buddy <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future .. will remember you for first year <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The story goes back to first year when I used to visit pappu's room quite frequently and as he was pappu's room-mate we did get to know each other. But at that time it was more like aquaintainces then friends. But then TB happened and we became good friends.<br>This guy is a hell lot of fun to be with. He has a tipical way of leofying people, arjun ke teer types nishana hai iska ... ekdum sahi point par lagta hai. Par hamesha bhi aisa nahi hota .. log sochte hain ki ye hamesha acche hi jokes marta hai .. but hes clever than that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Ye pehle bat dheere se bolta hai taaki kisi 1 bande ka reaction dekh sake .. agar accha hua to phir jor se bolega to get a LOL from the mob <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And somehow most of the times wo 1 banda main hi hota hu <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>I have had one of the worst experience of my college life with him. Jab inhone 3rd yr ki holi me bhang chadha li thi .. aur bathroom me gir gaye the. Me and madu carried him to hospital and damn nurse told me to hold his head while she stitches his head .. I was like wtf <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Then the night out in hospital when every other second some or the other patient in room will puke or suffocate while breathing .. hell!! hospitals are BAD <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>After I moved into his wing in 4th yr .. we 've had loads of BC sessions. specially while placements.While his CAT preperations when the whole wing used to do BC in night he used to sleep at time. And the next day tell us all that we discussed about ... and says 'saala main bistar par lete-lete has raha tha' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Theres one thing about this lad that he cares just too much about the surrounding people, and what they think about him. Sometimes hes not himself, he doesn't put his point outrightly .. always wants to play safe, go with the mob. Buddy I will advise you, for once, try risking .. be confident and you can achieve anything. you have the caliber you just need the confidence to crack anything.<br>Well, in the end .. I 'll remember him as One of my good friends, expert in leofying people, my wingmate, apna indori bhai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Hope to see you in hyderabad buddy. Theres more to come <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best ...<b> researcher</b> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>So, young lady ..

<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>And as they say .. relationships once broken will always have that knot .. I ne'er felt that comfortable around her after that .. but anyways she has been one very good friend of mine .. and yeah my ONLY sister in IIIT <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I really have learnt a lot from her .. Thanks a lot for all that support you gave me.<br>Other than those bad times .. we have had quite a joyful time also .. I remember the CVIT tragedy we all went through .. and it was quite a laugh .. Many outings, niteouts, train journeys .. those are all very good memories .. I remember the time when she came to my home once in bhopal .. it was fun .. All the tutorials she gave us all through the B.tech .. The fun we had while studying together .. Reading room, library, Main building Everything is as memorable as it can be <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. This girl was effectively the first one to get placed in campus .. nice job!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>When we got selected in same company .. I thought the journey isn't over .. but well m happy as you have got what you wished for .. All the best in life .. I dont need to tell you that you'll be a good IT professional, a good daughter, a good sister or a good wife .. I think you already know that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Prashasti gupta ... a name I'll ne'er forget. This girl is an all rounder .. sports women for two years ... a 9 pointer and highest paying job in campus .. what else can you expect .. but this is just one aspect .. she has earned a lot more than this .. good friends .. a special one .. and a lot more wellwishers. Bravo!! <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Our story goes back till first semester .. at that time she used to be afraid of me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. she used to think of me like some mawali .. newaz, that was just first semester .. after that second semester was one of the best times in my life .. the fun we had was awesome ... BC, nitouts and what not .. there were many firsts at that time .. and it all felt good .. but as it is said, nothing lasts forever .. the group broke up .. we had many fights .. some were heart broken .. and it all ended on a bad note. But well thats what life is .. it teaches you one or the other way .. it had to be this way .. and m pretty sure all of us have learnt a lot from that .. she has been a important part of my learning process .. recited the same thing repetedly uncountable times to me when I was low .. Well, I did learn, but on the cost of our relationship.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>MUX.<br>This guy can do BC anytime. I haven't seen him depressed or angry or sad anytime ... one very special thing about this person is his jolly nature .. and that explains his friendship with so many people in the batch.<br>I came to know this guy through CVIT .. when we joined together in II year. All the times I have spent with him has been great ... I remember those meetings with jawahar .. and how he always used to get screwed up and even then ... after coming out .. he tells us all how he got screwed with a laughter on his face. The times when we used to study DIP and PR .. He never ever refused to explain anything .. even if hes not finished his own studies. The portal guy .. as we all know .. whenever theres a portal for our batch .. mux has always been there.<br>He has a blog like no-one else .. total BC posts .. based on his imagination .. featuring real life characters. He sometimes act childish .. and thats why we had a li'l fight .. but thats al right man .. as someone said .. 'fights strengthens relationships'.<br>I have been to his room many a times while gandhi an india .. and now for crop and building sciences a night before exam so that he will teach me ... and he never refused. Thanks a lot for that man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He is a very nice and honest person at heart .. and a very very good friend to have .. as he'll always stand by your side.<br>I wish you all the best for your MS buddy .. hope the college kicks you out soon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Message: Rehna tu .. hai jaisa tu !!<br>Best memories: Chats after jawahar meeting in III yr <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When I finished writing last testimonial .. I felt theres still more to write about this fellow. Somehow it didn't feel complete.<br>As this guy is my neighbor, we have had endless BC sessions in our wing. One of the unique quality of raman you wont find in anyone is when he sings.. he can't remember a single line of any song.. you say him to sing the same song twice and he will sing with different lyrics <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. Theres one more quality .. jaldi bura nahi manta .. kai cheezo lite leta hai .. And I appreciate you for that.<br>He also suffers from the I-keep-my-room-clean syndrome. He watches sitcoms like OC and .. I have heard its a drama .. but I have seen him laughing like anything while watching OC .. I don't know why <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>He is a great TT player .. and likes to flaunt it while playing .. he will try to smash at every serve aur jab nahi padti to drama karta hai.<br>As I said hes my neighbor .. whenever I listen to loud music .. either he comes to my room or buzz me to slow down the music .. I hate him for that .. but will miss him for the same <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>A very good singer <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .. aawaz bahut acchi di hai bhagvan ne .. bas lyrics yad karna seekh le <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>All in all a very good friend <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Will miss his blank face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My friendship with raman has been a roller-coaster ride all through 4 years. There were times when we did not liked a sight of each other ... and there were times we enjoyed studying together and cursing jawahar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>I came to know him through pagare in first year .. the initial image of this guy was of a chutiya, but as I came to know him better I knew that he was just dumb enough to say anything without thinking. I have leofied him a lot in second year .. and he took his revenge in third year .. we're even now buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>We became close friends in third year, as we share the same fate of being under jawahar. I shared a lot of things with him and learnt a lot f things .. it was then when a metamorphosis was happening for me. We have had great times while studying DIP PR and VISION.<br>This guy is a carefree chap..sleeps like kumbhkarn..18 hrs continuous is something <img src=Smileys/10.gif />..sometimes a lil selfish..but thats alright <img src=Smileys/1.gif />..he has potential but dont realize it..buddy what you need to have is a killer instinct and you can do many things. dont underestimate yourself. We have had many BC sessions..less enjoyable..more leofying each other..but those were fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>A nice guy at heart, better friend to have.<br>Tags: carefree, jawahar ka student <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, dulla, sotla.<br>Message: Mind your words .. and don't mess with zawahar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Then came the third year summer ... pagare, khatri, maroo, paro got intern in bangalore .. it was a big relief for <br><br>me .. as I would have missed a hell lot of things without them. Every weekend I used to go to these guys place ... <br><br>and the time we spent there was a laugh riot .. khatri is a stand alone comedian .. every word he speaks is <br><br>hilarious. Every person associated to that summer is special to me. The foosball we had at MS .. the typeracer <br><br>races .. paro's chai every 10 minutes .. madu's discussion with his chutiya roommate whether on topics like whether <br><br>japan is more technoogically advanced or US .. the nite out we had at his flat .. the Ooty trip .. his CAT <br><br>preperation even in those golden days .. everything was LEGEN...wait-for-it..DARY ... And this is on eguy I have <br><br>seen who leofy himself .. that too to auto walas. I can definitely say those were the best days of my life .. and <br><br>it wouldn't have been without anyone of the people around.<br>There are some very particular characteristics about this guy.. iska gussa ... baap re.. kabhi kabhi zara se mazak <br><br>me bhi gussa ho jata hai ... jyada excite ho jata hai ... aisa lagta hai maar hi dega .. in fact ise kabhi bolo ki <br><br>tu mazak-mazak me bhi serious ho jata hai .. to bhi naraz hokar(read .. serious hokar) bolta hai "tum log phokat hi <br><br>bolte rehte ho .. main kahan serious hota hu" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>This guy has one of the dirties room in IIIT ... you wont even find a place to go to the bed ... everything .. <br><br>right from shoes to clothes to ghar-se-aaya-naastha is on floor ... you have to jump to get to his bed. He sleeps <br><br>early in the night .. prays before having meals .. dunno how .. but always maintain the gentleman look .. half <br><br>blind already .. have descent muscles .. friendly .. helpful .. dumb enough to speak something to divert the <br><br>leofying BC towards himself.. the billi pakad .. all in all ..one of my best friends in IIIT ..<br>Love you bro ..wish you great success ahead.<br><br>Great Memory: Time spent in bangalore, Ooty</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Madu ... One of the best all rounder in IIIT. Be it management, studies, BC or personal relationships.<br>Back in the first sem, I used to be in khatri's room for most of the times. He was just a couple of rooms away. The <br><br>image this guy had on me was .. the guy with thick glasses who always stick to his time table and keeps his room <br><br>dirty. We had a lot of hilarious BC sessions back then when we were leofying one or the other in the wing. Then the <br><br>TB formed and we became good friends. In second year we have had uncountable number of BC sessions ... going to <br><br>dinner daily and the dinner table BCs were awesome. I remember DISCO case when he was screwed by our profs ... I <br><br>din know what happened but I was so angry at the meeting at basketball court that I broke into tears <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..<br>Newaz, this guy has a spirit to help friends selflessly. One of my worst time in IIIT was when I got an F in DBMS <br><br>course and him and chand were the two friends who stood by me through that period ... I can't thank you enough for <br><br>that. from then we've been great friends. Then came the third year .. Mr coordinator ... the timetable guy hadled <br><br>everything perfectly .. The guy was so engrossed in felicity that he screwed his sem pointers. I have learnt a lot <br><br>of things from him at that time .. many by discussions we had and much by the dedication I saw in him. I dont know <br><br>If I can do anything with that dedication ever <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>There have been many memorable times we had together ... some were good some were bad ... another worst memory of <br><br>IIIT was when cheeka got hurt on 3rd yrs holi ... we stood by him in the hospital whole night ... both of us very <br><br>tired ..having mid sem after two days .. and still we were there .. what a night that was ... <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>You ask for help and hes always there .. a friend indeed <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In first year we din have any of those sessions where people get senti and speak their heart out. But our strings just clicked ... he offered me to be his roommate and there we were sharing one room.<br>From that time this guy has been one of my best buddies in IIIT ... he has supported me a lot in my II year ... being a roomy with this guy was an awesome experience. We never-ever fought over anything. He likes to keep the room clean ... and I'm one of never-clean-his-room kind of guy ... but he never complained. We have had a lot of hilarious BC sessions and walks around the campus .. and buddy m still not clear in which city you were in which standard <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>This guy is addicted to photography. I still remember the first time I bought a camera phone and we had a photosession ... about 150 photos were clicked in a room that day .. and that was AWESOME <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. And obviously he has improved in his photography skills. just one weird thing .. he ne'er looks AT the camera when hes gettin a photo clicked <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>We have had a weird badluck in many things when we're together ... its like ... every excursion we go on .. if something CAN go wrong it WILL go wrong. But anyways we've njoyed even those badlucks <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. We have somewhat similar taste for music and have njoyed a lot of time listening to one another's colection.<br>Also, this guy is a fatta master .. although he has lost his touch .. but still he comes back in form once in a while. He must be the guy with max nicknames in IIIT. Every t-shirt he gets has some or the other weird symbols which contributes to his nickname <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Ask him to shout and you'll hear that buzzing sound for the next three days. bhagvan ne ise gala nahi loud speaker diya hai. He doesn't need a phone to talk to his parents .. he just shouts and they listen to him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. He even thinks loud enough that you can hear him <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><br>This was whatever I can think as of now .. but m sure its not finished .. there will be more .. wait and watch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Madu ne to kitab likh di ... ab kuch bacha hai likhne ke liye ...<br><br>@madu: janamkundali bhi likh deta <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This guy is an all rounder ... studies, management, designing, BC does everything.<br>I have spent a fair amount of time with him designing for felicity and surely hes one of the best partners I have had while designing something. He can really think out of the box ... its not only designing that matters ... it should be at the right place and time .. and he knows that well.<br>As far as I have seen he really listen to everybody but speaks only when he needs to ... a nice guy in all.<br>Buddy I have learnt a lot from those designing sessions ... and enjoyed that time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for your future in chennai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Good things come in small packets ... true...<br>our chota bhai is full of energy. I love his collection of songs. We have had a loads of hang out together in 3rd year in ma rum ... he made me dance on many occasions. we have had many session of guessing the song from its instrumental.<br>Hes a guy you can look upto whenever you feel low ... and he'll make you laugh ... <br>Keep up the good jumping job buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for the future</b></i></ul><br><br>
