<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Vipul aka Budhha aka Bahu aka Rangeen Budhha aka Pagal Kutta</u><br><br>Vipul... Dunno how, when and where to start writing his testimonial. He is the guy who has been my friend for the longest time. With some other people, we started late, with some others lost a bit of touch some time later. BUT this guy has been amongst my closest friends right from the word go and still is my closest chum <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Thanks a lot buddy for being there for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> a factor for this friendship being that he has always lived close to me, first two years in cellar and then in the same wing in the alternate rooms in the last 2 years.<br><br>I think I must have been the first guy who interacted with him, he was a shy guy back then, who wouldnt talk to anybody but since we were together in section B2 so he started inteacting with me a bit coz we had to go together to the classes and this is when I started depending on him, he would always be the person I would entrust with my notebooks and all (he was quite a sincere guy then) and I was prone to losing my notebooks if we ever stopped at coffee shop or any other place while coming back from classes. He has always been the goto guy for almost our whole group, back in first and second year, almost the whole cellar would wear his shirts coz he was the only one who would always wash his clothes while humare clothes gande pade rehte the.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>If you look at Vipul in 1st year and now, you will realise that he is the person who has changed the most n these 4 years, there has been a complete reversal in his nature, and I would like to take the credit for being the person to bring about this change in him, am pleased to see the change in him. The change has meant that he has started to enjoy life as it is meant to be instead of being cuckooned in his shell. He has always wanted to enjoy his life but his shy nature and some inhibitions that he had, meant that he wasnt able to gel so well with the group and was left out as a result. Even though he was the roomie of Raman, but he was a late joinee to the group coz till that time, it was only me who interacted with him, even Raman, his roomie wasnt too much in favour of having him in the group. But slowly and slowly he started getting comfortable and started interacting with people around. Although he became a member of TB but I would say that he became a member of the group in the real sense only after we shifted to OBH.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>It has been a joyride since we came to OBH, these two years will definitely count as my best, the amount of BC and the fun we had in the last 3 years has been almost infinite, will always cherish all the BC we have done over these years <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> It will be the most unforgettable part of my life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of the most awesome thing among these is the way he <b>leofies</b> Chand. He almost treats him like a dog, and almost always Chand never has the answer to his rebukes and sarcasm, bechara bas chup hoke nikal leta hai. There is an interesting concept in our wing, there is a circle of leofying in our wing. The cicle would be something like this<br>Vipul->Chand->Himank->Manish->Maroo->Vipul. (Mathur unfortunately is easy target and kisi ki nahin le pata <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>Each person has his own nemesis in the wing as well his victim. Its been loads of fun doing all this BC. Will reminisce all these memories fondly once we are out of here <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The guy is senti to the core, he must be one of the most senti guy I have met and yet he never goes overboard when it comes to displaying his sentiness. It never is irritating or anything. The awesomest part about his sentiness comes out when he drinks, its a cryathon then, whenever he is quite out, it almost always turns into a crying session. I will always remember the first time we drank in his room, all the BC he did, it was just awesome <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, wont go too much into details coz of the lack of time but we all will remember it for long time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>Since time immemorial, he has been my secret keeper, he would always be the first person who I would go to whenever I had to tell anything. Right from the beginning I found some strange type of confidence and relief whenever I talked to him. He was the first person to know THE secret, thanks a lot for always being there for me. I know if it hadnt been you at that time, my life would have been frustrating as hell. I dont think I would have managed to bear that alone. I don't think I will ever be able to repay you for the support you provided me back then. Although the suggestions you gave me were rubbish  <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but the fact that you were there for me and I could talk to you about it was the sole thing which helped me carry on, without getting bogged down by the weight of the issue. Again and again I would say Thanks a lot buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>One thing about him is that, being senti, he takes to things a little too seriously at times, which means that he can get hurt even over trifling issues, at times you need to be careful over where you are treading when he is concerned. Though he has gone easy on this thing in recent past, but I feel that he needs to improve a bit on this aspect. Another negative thing with him is that at times, he becomes too dependent and reliant on a single friend and can at times start ignoring other people, which is never gonna bode well for him. Dude you seriously need to work on these issues and you will be the most perfect friend anybody can ever have, coz all other things about you are just too awesome. He is one of the most selfless guy I have ever met in my life, saying that the whole TB has survived through their B.Tech using his stuff would just be an understatement. He is always ready to help you out whatever the situation be, and whatever your need.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 5]</b><br><br>His room is the most comfortable and friendly in whole of UG2k5, Back in the first 2 years, almost everybody in the whole cellar used to come to his room and sleep in his room. His room is the cleanest I have seen of any guy, I am not sure if even girls can manage such clean rooms <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> If his was the sleeping room in cellar, then it became the BC room after coming to OBH, taking the title away from NBH-47. There have been countless BC sessions in his room. Almost everytime there is BC in a room in OBH. Its his room which is chosen for the purpose.<br><br>He is a gem of a guy, I think this adjective is very often used incorrectly but this guy truly deserves the honour of being called that, I have never EVER met a guy as sweet and nice as him. Right from the word go, I have been a fan of his nature. And now after spending 4 years with you, I am indebted to you, I never could have had such a great life in this college if not for you. I know you are a bit chu**atic at times but you are the best chu**iya I have ever had the chance to meet in my life. I know I am getting repititive but I could go on thanking you on and on and yet it wouldnt be enough to show my gratitude to you.<br><br>I could keep writing and this tale will never finish, he is the person with whom I have spent the maximum time in IIIT but since there's a deadline to meet and time is one commodity which is very rare right now. But you know that what you mean to me, any piece of testimonial or anything can never ever come close to describing what you mean to me. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />  Love you man!!! Will miss you a lot, you have been an integral part of my college life, cant imagine my life sans you in the college.<br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future... Hoping that we will always be in touch, life would be so incomplete without you.<br><br><b>Most Memorable Moment: I can never point out anything but if I had to say one thing then it would be the time when we shared those text files (hope u remember ) btw i lost the files, need them :|</b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I don't know why but he looks like a Rajasthani, a person doesn't have to think twice about it.<br>His mannerism is simple and pleasant. We've had some nice dinner table chats! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Looking forward to spend some more time with you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vipul Mittal aka beepul bai aka apna buddha.....<br><br>Ye banda sahi me alag hi hai, an outstanding person<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. In our first year when We got to know each other, I realized he would be the perfect one with whom I can share my room...at that point I was totly right,I couldn't have better room partner than him. I really cherished first couple of year a lot because of him and the sharing box concept aur us time jab hum dono mil jate the to PK aur bhalu aur maruti ki bahut lete the. This guy trully makes justice to the word "sajjan or shushil or gharelu<img src=Smileys/24.gif />"....<br><br>banda kabhi kisi ke liye galat nahi soch sakta even if one hurt him very badly. A true helpful person, humesha kisi naa kisi ki madad karta raheta hai. He never cared what other people thinks about him, but some times he becames short tempered when someone makes fun of him<img src=Smileys/10.gif />, in reply back, he restricts himself to talk to that person for quite long time...yeah!!! that "someone" person is me<img src=Smileys/20.gif />, but its his nature which is not bad because every one has certain limit....<br><br>humesha kisi se kuch mann ki baat nahi kaheta hai even if something is hurting him very deeply, but he has changed drastically in the last two year, which is quite surprising ....started drinking passionately, bahut bc karne laga hai aur to aur aajkal to logo ki leta bhi hai khas kar ki Chand ki<img src=Smileys/21.gif />!!!! Seriously ye banda aisa hai ki iske bare me koi kabhi galat soch hi nahi sakta. I truly respect this guy from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>He is a great dancer too aur jo iska performance tha "nain lad jaiyo" song pe that was undoubtably fantabulous. When I look back, he din't have many friends except some, but now the count keeps increasing that shows how much he changed in the last two years...  since you are not leaving college as other's so chahekar bhi emotional baatein nahi likh paa raha hun....That is it!!! <br><br><br>one liner for him -> ek madadgaar jo kahin pe kaise bhi kisi ki bhi madad kar sakta hai<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ....hehaheha...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Budhao/Bhai ---- PART I<br>Just to begin with "He is of my closest friends". A person who has been my strength in IIIT-H. He has always shown so much trust in me. A person who knows me so well. We have golden memories<br>together, A true friend, Vipul Bhai! This testimoial is special.<br><br>Surprisingly we never talked much in the firs two years. I knew him more as Raman's roommate. A person who keeps his room clean. He was very different in first two years, different as in<br>he did not socialise much. He had a friend circle and he was pretty much confined to that. Then we moved to OBH and he became my neighbour in third year and after that it has been a memorable journey with him. He is one person, I have always asked for favour and rarely did I do anything for him. He is the supplier of most of the things I need, right from the deospray,notebooks,pens and toothpaste. even when he is in a deep sleep I would bang his door wake him up and take the toothpaste. I have never felt uncomfortable asking him for a help. For the people, he is an awesome dancer, he is pretty much the best in his field of research that is LTRC. We have had many awesome memorable moments together. I remember right from the second year I have always tried all the new stunts on him, throttled him, "bhai bande ko leta leta ke maara hai".</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>On the lighter side, Vipul is pigeon chested, has infinite marks on his face, always carries a plain look. This motherfucker knows how to exaggerate things, we fondly call him Komolika.<br>He is so good at adding spice to stories and narrates them as if it is true. Has a feminine<br>touch to him, "thoda nazuk sa hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". He has leofied me the most, I am doomed when he comes to<br>pulling my leg. He treats me like a dog, whenever I come to his room he is so fucking damn rude<img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>I remember irritating him with late night BCs. He would come and shout at us(Me,Bhalu and Manish) the next morning. He has taught me NLP (I hope now you are happy!), he has done my assignments though he never worked on the projects and presentations I took with him. I have hardly seen him working on his thesis though he has good rapport with everone in LTRC <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. "Bhai PR se MS nahin milne waali". Bhai, was leaving in an entirely different world in the first two<br>years. He took up lot of things after coming to OBH, started listening to rock (Infact he is the only one who listens to death metal), started boozing and more than anything he started socialising. He is a total spend thrift, "Bhai kO LTRC waale muft ke paise dete hain aur ye udate hain". And it is fun to watch when Maroo scolds him for spending so much. He also started smoking but good for him that he left it. Bhai ko masaledar cheezien dekhna ka bada saukh hai.. suits his komolika image. Right from Big Boss, Roadies to splitsville he has watched all. When we are leofying him he suddenly goes silent.When he wants you out of his room he would go completely mum.<br>He  is the member of elite beweda club. I will miss the daroo get togethers we had. Whenever he is drunk, he gets out all his anger on me. In the last couple of drinking sessions he has got all senti an all. He will atleast cry once whenever he is drunk.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part III<br><br>It was because of a glass of beer I came to see a very different side of Vipul. Vipul is "exteremly" caring, its rare that a person is worried about you even when you are  not around him. He likes to be pampered. He doesn't let out his feelings to people easily. He trusts people<br>a lot. If he considers you a friend then he would blindly trust you. Again, he is one of my best critics and thanks for correcting me time and again. I remember, how many times he has come to me and told me about my mistakes. I am a self-praising person and he hates that(most of them do!). He just snaps back at me whenever he finds me self gloating. Vipul bhai is one of those who would keep his feelings inside, I mean if he is hurt he would not let us know. You have to pester him , ask him repeatedly. Bhai, chhoti chhoti baaton pe bhi gussa ho jaate hain. I remember, I came to campus after a very long ride and I was totally tired he asked me to accompany him to Subway; I refused and bhaisaab gussa ho gaye. He went alone after that. He gets angry  even if I unknowingly ignore him which shows how much possesive he is about his friends. At times , I have felt we have never stood up to his expectations, as a friend he has done a lot for all of us. He has always been there whenever I needed him, always stood by me. Vipul Bhai, I just want to tell you that I know that how much you have done for me and you have a special importance in my life.<br><br>Some Memories, Toothpaste incidents, we both leofying each other, all the club 8 outings,<br>you cursing me after you get drunk, leofying you for your feminine touch, all the long walks we had, taunting you for treating me bad. Now we will not be together and just to think of it I will not have some one to bug next door is eery. I got so used to irritating him , bang the door every morning and taunt him for some or the other thing. I am seriously going to miss you Budhao.<br>You are a great friend, I owe a lot to you!<br><br><br>Cheers!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br>This testi is going to be about an emotional, senti, friendly, caring guy who goes into SILENT mode whenever he gets leofied.<br><br>Never interacted with apne Vipul bhai in first 2 years although I used to go to his room a few times to meet Raman. This guy was shy and hence, I couldn't get to know him until the third year when he became my wingmate, thanks to Chand for that. Vipul bhai apne "The Most Sophisticated" person in UG2K5 as he claims, but he actually is quite sophisticated. Keeps his room neat and clean. When my parents came, my room was at its best as far as cleanliness is concerned, but when they saw Vipul bhai's room, their first comment after that was "Tu apna room saaf kyun nahi rakhta" .... mujhe pata nahi tha that they have seen Vipul's room, maine immediately poocha ki aapne buddhe ka room dekha kya? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> banda bahut hi emotional hai .... pehle to kuch bhi movie dekh kar ro deta tha, ab to fir bhi isne rona kam kar diya hai. Bahu is one of his nicknames. According to Chand, his character resembles Komolika <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He also loves to bitch about others ... aur Maroo ke roop mein ise ek aisa jodidaar bhi mil gaya hai who also likes the same thing. This guy gets irritated very easily. Iske room par kuch bhi aisa kar do jisse room thoda sa ganda hone ki just possibility ho aur room actual mein ganda bhi na hua ho, tab bhi irritate ho jata hai and then he goes into his famous silent mode. Ye akela aisa banda hai jisne 4 saalon mein Chand ki mujhse jyada li ho. Zaroorat ka kuch bhi saaman chahiye ho, Vipul bhai hain na. Choti se choti aur badi se badi zaroorat ki cheez inke room par mil jayegi. His room is the BC place of our wing kyunki akela aisa room hai is wing mein, jo saaf rehta ho. Ye bahu kammeni, kulta, kulachchini bhi hai. Jab doosron ki lene par aati hai to leti hi rehti hai, chodti nahi. He and Maroo irritates me a lot sometimes, kamine saale. But really, its fun to be around him. Choti Choti baaton ke baare mein bhi bahut sochta hai.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br>A very good friend I must say who will always be there whenever his friends are in need. Roz bolta hai ki haan be, aaj bhaagne jaunga, aaj gym chalunga, aur jab iske room par jao, "abe aaj nahi be" and the same thing repeats everyday <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Isko humne bhi kafi irritate kiya hai. Ye incident maine apne sab wingies ki testi mein likha hai probably jab Vipul aur Maroo wing tak chodne par aa gaye the. Bechara Kshitij bhi bahut pareshan hua tha. Chacha ka bhi buzz aaya tha. Actually we were trying to wake Sambhav up from Chand's room (Sambhav's room is exactly below Chand's) at nearly 4:30 AM by continuously hitting a dumble on the floor aur agle din jo galiyan padi thi logon se <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He is a very good dancer as well. "Nain Lad jai ve" par banda kya naachta hai. How can we forget those dance practice sessions with Tava ... vassa re vassa vassa re, pad haa roop kaarambu sth <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Doosron ko padhata hai, par jab main kuch padhane ko bolun, to bolta hai "abe tujhe nahi padhaunga" .... hadd kamina hai.

Main, ye aur Maroo milkar Mathur ki chop karte rehte hain. All in all, I find this emotional guy a real good friend who cares a lot for his friends. The time I have spent with him in this wing in these 2 years has been amazing and I'm happy that I got a wingie like him. A lot is there to be said but yearbook ki deadline khatam ho rahi hai .... probably some other time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Bhai hai yaar tu. College ke baad room ke paas mein tum logon ki presence ko main bahut bahut miss karne vala hun <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . 5 saal mein MS khatam kar liyo. aur hum log milte to rahenge hi, hyd mein jo hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Thanks for being a part of the 2 wonderful years of my college life and making it more fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . You are a very good friend of mine and we'll definitely remain in touch.

<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vipul aka Rangeela Buddha aka Bahu aka ...<br><br>I must confess when I met him in first year he was a quite type of guy, but comes second year and he is all squeaky and chattery. It seemed as if GOD of leofying himself made him his private angel and bestowed him with greatest of his powers <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. This is true even now and I think Chand and many others can testify my statement. I have known him from my first year, we have been wing mates, not to forget we have shared some good moments which I can never forget.<br>We came closer in summer vacation after third year. We used to go to yuktahaar mess and on our way back we had good times at canteen drinking juice and sharing lighter moments. I dont think I can control what comes out of my mouth at all times, but I said something to him in second year, which he seemed to have taken to his heart. He never told me what it was, but I have said my apologies to him everytime he got drunk. Because that's when he will bring the topic, always <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.  From what I know he is very dedicated towards studies, the guy has already put on his research shoes and made quite a reputation for himself in LTRC lab. Good going mate, I wish you all the best and may you join us in hyd after your MS. I will always have a reserved space for you in my heart.<br>This guy has seen a lot and consequently changed a lot. From a guy who rarely spoke to a guy who can render you speechless with his wittiest answers and yes they are sometimes real nasty. A guy who never gives heed to the comments passed on him and remain composed in all circumstances or this is what it seems who knows what he is hiding. From what I recall the metamorphosis of his character happened sometime in second year, which I think was for the good.<br>As is the case that I am pretty weak in tailoring my thoughts into words, this seems a reasonably short testimonial for such a good friend but neverthless I will be there for you dude, writing testimonials to you. My heartiest wishes for you buddy, may you succeed in all your endeavours.<br>Peace. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Gets angry very easily <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but instead of showing his anger he prefers to remain silent.

Considers himself really mature, more like a dadaji <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and always ready to give his expert comments and fundes.<br>Helped me a lot on the last Holi after my accident by carrying me to the hospital, even though he didn't fully recover from the Bhang effect.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Vipul aka Budhdha has always remained a mystery to me. Speaks so less that I have never understood what is there on his mind <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Got to know him in first year as Raman's silent roomy who prefered cleanliness over anything else. Though people say he has changed a lot in these four years but for me he is the same as was back in the first year, a very quiet fella. <br><br>Our relationship in these four years hasn't changed much. Still our conversations are limited to just casual greetings to one other except on some special ocassions. Sometimes his silent attitude can be irritating as well especially when you are willing to talk and he is very much unintereted to even listen to you. It is more of a monologue while conversing with him. You go to his room, speak for 5-10 mins and all you got in reply is a yes, a no or a hmmm. This is where I think he needs to change. Learn to talk more.<br><br>Cries a lot for every small thing, rotlu saala <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Gets too much emotional when he is drunk and sheds his tears <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> like some typical saas-bahu soap character. Never seen him laughing once when he is drunk. He is one of those guys who really is not a social kind of person and just sticks to his 4-5 close friends. Rarely  interested in doing BC with others. Even forms opinion about people quickly and then sticks to them no matter what. A little advice that I would like to give him is to start seeing things and people from different angle as well.<br>The most systematic guy in our group who keeps his room clean like hell. One can find all day-to-day stuff orderly arranged in his room and his room acts more like a storehouse for others in his wing. One of the best traditional dancers in IIIT. His latke-jhatke on 'nain lad jai hai' is fun to watch <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

When both of us get together, we do bitch about others sometimes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I must admit, it is fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I'd also remember the umpteen breakfasts we've had together in OBH. Its a routine- One of us gets up, knocks at the other's door, we freshen up and go down for breakfast, often as much as nothing being spoken. It often remainds me of, "You dont need to have a conversation with a good friend, his mere presence is enough". I'll also take back the BCs we'd have in the morning. Often, Himank, Chand and co. would BC their lungs out throughout the night in the corridor, and we'd talk about getting frustrated in the morning <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And the support hes given me during my CAT days was amazing, he'd often egg me on. <br><br>All in all, its been an amazing journey- from "hello and hi" to being fab pals.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>But here, because of his reclusive nature, he tends to take a cynical point of view of things once too often. Its not always black, and I think he needs to recognize grey in life, and accept it. That has of course changed over time, but I think this aspect of his needs to change. I often feel it comes along with your shyness. But yes, he has been flexible- changed a lot especially considering his background. From a soothsayer to a next-door-drinking-pal, hes had one helluva journey! Drinking sessions are not complete <br>without some guys getting senti- and Vipul is one of them. Ah.. and when drinking, the big five thingy, rofl dude <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He prides himself on not puking, but that mith has been broken now <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And how can I not mention, hes one of the most sophisticated guys around <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And yeah, hes also taken over as the shopping king <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Jokes apart, he sometimes goes 'silent' when we're leofying him- and thats what we're scared of. When he goes silent, we dont know whats the problem- whether its something which we said, whether its his mood.. Haha. Anyways, thats the next thing I think he needs to change, take things in hs stride and make it clear when he doesn't like things being said. As for his ambitions in life, well he never speaks about them. But hes a guy who'll always be your-friendly-next-door-neighbour; I do not expect his basic nature to change. <br><br>Hes helped me a zillion times. After my third year, when I was in Bangalore; he shifted all my belongings (Which is a very difficult task I must admit, my room is among the messiest in campus) voluntarily, so that I do not stay isolated in my old wing. I was really touched that day. I felt sad when I hurt him when I was sloshed. But since then, things have changed so much that hes the first guy that I'll turn to for help. I'll also remember the so-many-times when I'd call him up for help- could range across a lot of things and he'd always oblige. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</i></b><br><br>Vipul. One of my closest friends in IIIT. We hardly ever spoke in the first one and a half years, but my moving to the cellar in NBH helped me create a lot of new bonds. Vipul is the one among the them which I cherish the most. <br><br>We started interacting beacuse of our waking up times, I still remember those 8'o clock walks to OBH for those yummy parathas (Of course, with the customary Rs 4 change <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) At that time, I found him a very wierd person-I would go to Raman (his roomie)'s room and chat with him for a long time without as much as exchanging a hello with this Ajmeri. Actually, thats how Vipul is- shy and reclusive initially, but at his affable best when you'r a friend of his. In fact, we've often to do with what I'll call 'Vipulisms'- hes at his best when hes leofying Chand. Poor Chand, his neighbour! Well, I'm the other neighbour <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Ahh.. <br>So third year brought us a lot closer- We didn't interact much before Felicity, but a lot after that. We spoke and really found that our frequencies often matched. <br><br>Let me take a break here and talk about his essential nature. First thing, he does not open up immediately- he takes a lot of time to do so. You need to win his trust, but after that hes as good a friend as you can get. In fact, sometimes I think we have let him down as pals. He is always there for you when in need- but I'm not sure if we've done justice to him when hes needed us. But he'll be there for you, rest assured. Hes clean as hell- walk into his room and you'll <br>not feel as if its a hostler's room. Thats one of the major reasons why a lot of BC takes place in his room; something which can get onto you- especially when you like stuff to be in place and when you'r an early-to-bed kind of a guy. Hes a homely guy, warm and nice and clean and neat. A lot of it comes from his Rajasthan background. You'll find all the stuff you need in his room. Which makes me feel, agar Vipul nahi hota to hamara kya hota. <br><br>(cont..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
