<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Pankaj Saini -- A voracious reader of our batch. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> And due to his reading habits, he has achieved a good command over English. Whenever I have any doubt related to English, either I ping him or go to him to clarify my doubt.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And he undoubtedly clarifies them in most of the cases.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I am really thankful to him for that. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Initially, even I used to see English movies of his choice.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He is really a friendly and helping guy. <br>In addition to reading, he also writes nice posts on his blog. Sometimes, he writes about himself on his post but it is truly difficult to digest all that in one go.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Even we both participated in many events together viz DumbC, G.K. Quiz etc. All was really a great fun.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I will really miss that period.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Wish you achieve whatever aim in your life.<br>Stay in touch.<br>CHEERS!!<br><br>P.S.

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>People call him GKB but I fail to understand why.<br>I met him in English Literature class in 3rd semester. I was impressed when I learnt that he writes stories, read some of the stories and<br>liked them!<br>We talked a lot about movies and literature and recently about The Fountainhead.<br>Once I remember entering Banga's room and saw Pankaj reading "War and Peace" in his room, lying on the bed... the book was so think, meri toh phat hi gayi thi!! Not that I haven't read thick books, but phir bhi!!<br>In one of our conversations, he told me he preferred to spend his time reading literature and watching TV shows rather than studying because the former interested him more, and that he had done a lot of the former after coming to<br>IIIT.<br>I remember few weeks ago I went to his room and he was watching Supernatural. He started telling me everything about it, and I being interested listened, it was fun! We discussed about ghosts, supernatural things and their possible existence and possibility of their existence.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Pankaj Saini A.K.A. God-Ka-Baccha (GKB) is a really cool, charming personality. He probably will have more girl friends than I can even imagine <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Hence the nick-name, GKB <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>I didnt have much interaction with him in my first year or second year. But once I moved to cellar in my third year, we have become good friends and have been to many outings together, apart from the BC that we had in coffee shop almost everyday.<br><br>He's pretty good at english and an amazing narrator <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. You will even believe some uber crap when you hear it from his mouth <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Thats the kind of story-teller he is. He also likes to read lots of novels and he has a great knowledge about movies ( be it hollywood or bollywood ), another veteran in antakshari and dumb-charad like games <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>And yeah, how can I forget all those HSSM classes you took before the exams, be it globalization, or industry and society <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The amount of work he has done in any one of these course would be much more than the total work I do on academics on a whole semester <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's usually very goot at making and giving presentations <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>You are also one of the few good friends and guys who have supported me. Thanks for that <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br><br>You really belong to one of the IIM's and I hope you can get there next year. Good luck in life and keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I remember him from our english classes...he was this guy who used to talk about India,politics, Chandigarh all the time...used to wear formals then and gave a stay away from me kinda impression...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>But he has changed drastically over last four years..he is a die hard fan of movies and novels<img src=Smileys/1.gif />...has a keen interest in HSSM courses <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>The only memory  could remember is we fight every time we talk ...once swatidi,pankaj and me were sitting near volleyball court and all i remember was I and Pankaj were fighting aur swatidi beech mein fans gayi thi ..<img src=Smileys/21.gif />...<br><br>Anyways, all the best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 3<br><br>My first movie in theatre("No Entry") at hyd was also with him and one or two more guys of his group. Those Punjabi Rasoi outings can not be forgotten as well. That new year party when we both had long hair and were head banging like anything on rock, Felicity '07 rock show where you were wearing white t-shirt and I was wearing a red one <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and standing together in front row, we were head banging like anything (looks a bit idiotic now especially with those colour tshirts in rock show <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). I owe my globala grade completely to him. I felt really-2 bad when he got an A- (There was not a single person who deserved A more than him in that class). When it comes to HSSM, isse bada bond hamare poore batch mein koi nahi hoga. I have seen that he does a thing perfectly, madly, passionately and with full enthusiasm if he is interested in that thing but if he is not, then he won't give a damn. He won't do it. So, this is a minor suggestion from my side that even if you don't like something, do it as if it's your duty and don't screw that completely. His dedication for CAT was worth admiring. Though he couldn't make it this time but I'm sure that he'll definitely make it the next time. Tension mat le, MBA ke time apan dono fir se batchmates banenege <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Iska naam God ka bachcha kyun hai vo to har kisi ne bata hi diya hai. So, I won't go in that. A lot is there to be said. Probably some other time.<br><br>In the end:<br>You are a great friend dude. I'm luck to have a friend like you in IIIT. Thanks a lot for introducing me to the world of English movies and novels. Thanks for all the bc we have done, all the philosophical discussions we have done and everything for that matter. Find your passion in certain thing because I know that when you become passionate for a certain thing, you do it by becoming best in that. May God give you all the success and happiness in your life. Cheers to our friendship. Bangalore jakar bhool mat jaiyo aur contact mein rahiyo. Keep calling from time to time. God bless !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br>Then memorable moments also include bc sessions between Chand, him and me in NBH-146, Alok ki khoob lena, Alok ka Kabza gaane ke style par mazaak udana (Punjabi gaane ko bihari tone mein gaata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), then taking part in group singing competitions together for our house, practising for the songs, trying to reach the pitch of original Chaiyya Chaiyya <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, joy at winning in group singing, whole of our group going to collect certificate while from other groups, just 1 or 2 people were collecting the certificates, railway journeys with him where he used to tell us a lot of stories, sitting at the door of the railway compartment with legs hanging outside and doing bc there, guessing the speed of the train, doing bc whole night, getting a bit philosophical and then next day, writing "Sorry" on a chit and giving that to an uncle who got disturbed a lot that night <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and above all, a railway journey where we initially boarded a wrong train and then jumped from the running train with all our luggage and then going in waiting (what an experience that was man !! I can never forget that and I'm sure that even you can't), going to gym together, that special dance step of yours, reading Harry Potter series together and discussing it and many more. I started reading novels because of him. I found him really passionate for reading. Class mein bhi har time iske haath mein koi na koi novel dikh jata hai. It's just because of him that I read Fountainhead and it's the best novel I have read till date. Thanks for suggesting that buddy. The way he narrates the incidents is awesome. He is a good blogger as well. I don't know why he has stopped blogging now. I think it's time for you to revive your blogging <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . You can start with UG2k5 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br>Pankaj aka GKB<br><br>I first met this guy at the time of AIEEE counselling in Kurukshetra. That time he had beard and moustache and knowing his AIEEE rank, his first impression to me was - damn studious whose only aim in life is to study. Maine to Ojasvi ke saath milkar majak-2 mein ise peetne ka bhi plan bana liya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But I interacted with him in college and found out What an amazing guy he is ! I have interacted a lot with him in first 2 years and 4th year. But one year of my interaction with him in college is almost completely missing as in third year, we were staying in different hostels and couldn't get in touch. I'll definitely regret losing that 1 year but will cherish all the amazing time I spent in his company in the other 3 years. Going back to the first year, we have spent some quality time together. Getting ragged together, watching movies together, studying together .... being in different groups of friends didn't matter at all. I can definitely say that this guy is amongst my best buddies. I have learnt many things from this guy. I didn't use to see English movies back then. Aur is bande ne mujhe angrezi movies dikhane ke liye vo sab movies khud bhi mere saath baith kar dekhi. Iske saath movie dekhne mein maza bahut aata hai .... vo enthusiasm, vo har cheez movie rok kar explain karna especially in LOTR and Matrix, vo Godfather beech mein chodna because of me and Kabeer, Troy and our passion for Diane Kruger that time .... everything is so much memorable. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> Part2 </b><br><br>When I first met him, my first impression was he was very sincere guy. He used to talk about how much he used to study about JEE, His success in National Olympiads, NTSE.... But whoooosh....Dheere dheere usne apne patte fenkne shuru kiye...... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>We used to go to buy books on the first day of every semester. As if it was a competition to buy the books before all.... and then that was the only day in whole semester he loved those books <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Ek baar to utni saari kitaabe leke hum zoo dekhne chale gaye the... <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>I still remember how we used to do C programming assignments.... One time on the last day of assignment we were so frustrated and we left almost 50% of the work undone and watched three movies. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We used to go out so many times searching for laptop and all those outings were memorable. Especially the one in which we went to Universal, CCD, Pizza Hut on same day. we talked about so many things that time... n we became close friends... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He bought the first laptop in the cellar before ITWS end-sem exam... Then new era at the cellar started.... Chatting, Social networking on hi5, Orkut....Watching movies... Playing games.... Very few people might be knowing... He also loves to play Age of Empires... We used to go to UG4 lab... Arrange PCs and Play Age <br><br>You may think he is never serious at studies.... But i know how seriously he used to prepare for CAT.... He is damn intelligent... But just by bad luck he lost chance at IIMs even after scoring very high. Dont worry dude you deserve better than IIMs. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Loves to do BC and outings.... and never misses chance irritating and pulling legs of his room partner.... <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>We will always be friends.

I loved to talk with this guys about BMWs, Merc, Toyota, Honda, Scorpio, Safari for long time and never get bored. Hope you buy Corolla Altis soon .... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>First year we watched Matrix, LOTR series on Akansh Bhaiyya's room. He can watch these movies infinite number of times. He has by hearted all the dialogs of Matrix. And while watching movie he dips in the imagination world (in the character of Neo). His passion or spark while watching these movies is amazing. His email id- matrix_trap accentuates this fact...<br><br>Every time I want to see some movie or start watching new TV series or read a novel, I used to go to him and take his suggestion. Whenever I watched any TV episodes of GG, Himym, tbbt, the OC or movies with this guy, I loved them more.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Last but not least -  this guy is LEGEN (wait for it).................

I was worried how would i adjust here, but it was not late when my parents started commenting 'Saanu taan bhul hi gaya hain' <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.

He was determined, 'IIT main nahi hua, ab to mehnet karni hai, research karni hai...IAS ki tyari karni hai...koi kasar nahi chhodni'. He used to tell me about his intermediate days.

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is among my first friends in IIIT.<br>We did not talk much after second year.Major reason being we stayed in different hostels in the third year. But, whenever we met we made sure to talk our heart out. I remember my first meeting with him in cellar, he was<br>among the first rankers in our batch, he talked how strong he was in chemistry and how he raped Fiitjee tests. We both were in the same English<br>group and he was so sincere back then. He was very different in first year and went through a "Jassi jaise koi nahin hai" makeover later.<br><br>We had some intersting BC sessions mainly concentrating on life and some arbit philosophies. He is a great person to talk to and<br>you can talk to him about any random stuff.He has this "never say die attitude". He doesn't believe in artificiality. He would be good to you if he likes you or he wouldn't give a damn! He is the cassanova of our batch <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Popular with girls and bhai isse flaunt bhi karte hain and I hope he remembers my chat with him during the recent club 8 visit. He worked a lot for Felicity, especially in hospitality. I remember him running behind all<br>the organizers to get the names of the judges to arrange cabs for them. He is god in all the HSSMs, I owe my Globalization grade to him. From globalization I remember how kiddish he can get at times. I remember he was giving a presentaion in Globala and he fired all those who asked questions to him and was angry over other groups for delaying their presentation. He is very public about his personal life. Half of the time his status message has to do something with his life. He is a movie buff and is known to set the toughest movie quizes(which are easy according to his standards). An avid reader and phodu in Angrezi but interestingly he still has a touch of Haryanvi in his accent. He is full of energy and totally restless. <br>I will remember all the BC of second year, Felicity'08, all the philosophical discussions with you, your fucking tough movie quiz and the recent club 8 trip.<br>Ab Bangalore mein masti...<br><br>Cheers</b></i></ul><br><br>

Sometime he is very sensible and quite and some time totally opposite.  Only a few people r there, to <br>whom he really talks openly. Also a little egoistic. Bandio ke mamle me to Phd hai. Passionate abt novels and movies. And most of the time we ping him for suggesting movies. Some time he is very confident and Some time I hv seen him a little unstable abt his decision but showing <br>confidence to others. When it comes to BC .... bahut bada BCbaaz hai. In my perspective very few persons are there who realize the true meaning of life. Ye na to poore time serious reh kar bitane ke lie hai .... na he poore time BC or masti karte hue.

I wanted to be his room partner but this IIIT system didn't allow me! He never lived away from home before coming to IIIT. He was a kid who didn't know how this world works!!! He used to get excited even over small things. The only words he knew in first few months were "Daring", "Adventurous". We didn't spend much time together in the first semester as we were in different hostels. He was an intelligent guy (AIEEE 440) and used to talk about getting into Stanford or MIT on lunch tables etc. Those things used to scare me a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> So, I maintained some distance. <br><br>Aisa lagta hai ki main senti ho gaya hoon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> After first semester he realized that Stanford is a big thing and stopped talking about studies. We eventually started doing more BC. The real interaction started in 3rd semester when I moved to NBH. I came to know about his uncountable girl friends and friends who were girls and girls who were not friends and ... WHAT THE HELL!!!! How many girls do you know <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> And how are we supposed to remember the details of your romance with each and every one of them and especially when a lot of them share a common name <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Mind boggling moments they were. His girl friends used to die and somehow via re-incarnation they met each other and had stuff and then she died again <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> For a guy like me, it was totally disastrous.

And I might have hurt him several times because I couldn't judge the occasion <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Someday somebody during a BC session coined the name "God Ka Bachcha". I was so happy that day. After that I need not remember the details of his female friends because every girl belonged to him and had a crush on him. So we just need to nod whenever he said something which contained few regex like *girl* *bandi* *line de rahi hai* <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>

He likes doing things in his own imitable way. He has a way about women, and loves talking about it <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I still remember the conversation we had in second year about his love life, and the girl he had blogged about. In fact, I've shared a lot of interesting conversations with him, especially in second year when we were both in cellar. I still enjoy the chat sessions I have with him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Love his attitude towards a lot of things, and life in general.<br><br>Saini is an avid co-reader and I've picked up a lot of authors on his suggestion. The best among them, of course, has been Ayn Rand. He is also a movie freak, and unfortunately, I do not share this trait with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But beyond all the masti, hes also one chap whos concerned about his career, the effort he put into CAT preps was a testimony to the same. I really hope that he does make it big in the future.<br><br>Pankaj was one person who put in a lot of effort into Felicity '08. Really liked the way he went about doing things for the hosp and camp section.. He was pretty dependable and responsible <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I remember how he was frantically trying to arrange cabs and stuff <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He generally has that attitude, always ready to <br>help out friends.

I think we came close while visiting that zoo with heavy loads of books <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. That outing was real fun. Initially he used to talk about how he landed up in IIIT , how he used to top in all of the Fiitjee exams with above 99% percentile ^<img src=Smileys/3.gif />^, Matrix, LOTR and seldom talk about girls. The uncountable night-outs at his room are really unforgettable. We all used to seat together to discuss and gossip about random stuffs in our life. The real victim here was Alok who has to study all the time we spend on BC.I remember the discussion abt which is more imp "Money" or "Masti" and you choose money , and we had a debt for a long time over that ,I knw the things/priorities for you have changed now.<br><br>continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In first sem he was determined to keep his CG above 9 and go for MS abroad , I think the aim is a bit changed now <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He used to teach us ES, Physics , Maths etc altough I scored more marks than him in Maths and ES <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. At that the place we used to eat mostly was "Punjabi Rasoi", we used to go there as often we go for Dominos now a days.and we catch him for treat even for small occations like "You got more marks than me" <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> etc. He often gives us treat that time. In the second sem the frustoopna hit him real bad and a new <i>"Casanova"</i><img src=Smileys/5.gif /> took birth thereafter, He went mad about girls, he used to talk for hrs that time abt nothing but girls. <br>He is first one to have laptop in cellar, used to watch movies in his room. In past years,We used to have night-outs/walks more often.Lots of times we go for a walk and discussed things for longs hours, Loved to share and being philosphical at that time. Topics he start for discussion is very common but the points which comes out of the discussion was something you never thought of or harldy ever noticed. He started writing blogs. We always discuss, the no. of girls in his class and the relatives of his classmate who found him lovable <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Felicity'08 the hug-party was awesome. hope I could be there <img src=Smileys/20.gif />.<br>I think one of the main reason we bonded over is the that we both are movie buffs <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and love for outing anywhere/anytime. Movie Buffs bole toh sab types ki movie dekh sakte hain .... we always have something to talk about movies. For outings also he is hamesha ready . You don't have to force him to join for outing, There were many outings with him which are memorable like Little Italy, GC etc. His B'day treat at angeethi was a special day. We really enjoyed the day <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>	This person is straight forward and has a good [or I say a Kid like]  heart .<br><br>continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>	 Anything happens to him ,you can easily spot him cheering all over the cellar, writing blogs , changing his gtalk status etc. and the excitement with which he tells you the story makes you listen that , [altough sometime you know ki "Fenkh rha hain" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ].  He is having extra daring to do tasks as the hero does in the movies altough never got a real chance.	His zill for HSSM courses like English, Social enterprenur, Industry , Globla etc. is worth mentioning <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . In exam times whole of our batch (even seniors) use to come to his room for the tuition. After all that is done he repeats that for me (as I was ever late). Thanks for that <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. My BTP partner, with whom I have worked hard for completing my project.The report writing and modifying them to look good selecting font, size etc. was a great time-pass. I hope we will get atleast B. A Literary bond.Amazed by his knowledge of angrezi vocab.Ask him terms that you never heard of and get the meaning from him. He used to read novel most of the times, I think he has only three things to do read Novels, watch Movies and flirting,(Awesome way to spend life). In Dumb-c, while acting used to clap after every action he does as in clap means something <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Can't able to guess "Pearl Harbour" after my brilliant acting during house competition <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. His knowledge about places, country etc. is incredible <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br>	Now that he is B'lore I hope your office is nearby so that we can hang-out most of the times.I know you missed your chance in CAT this time but I am sure you will make it in coming year. Best of luck for that. Hopefully your future plan of having "Masti" 24*7 will be fulfilled <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. May god bless you bachche <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your helping nature, Your guidance and gyan , Your enormous energy to do anything.<br>Most Memorable moment : - Watching Godfather in Akansh's rum, Night-out before TOC exam, Golconda trip and many others.<br>Msg for U: - Think before act and don't disclose every details to evryone.<br>Song for U:- Bachna Ae Haseeno <br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
