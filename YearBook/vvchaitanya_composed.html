<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Being my family frnd ,I know this gal even before coming 2 IIIT. But I realized more of her nature in my very first semester <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She's one of those few persons whom I've seen wid xtreme competitive spirit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> A very sensitive and frndly gal whom neone wud lik 2 b as a frnd. I always wonder abt the levels of patience she shows wen it comes to things lik assignment, coding etc. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  A typical xample is the way she and ramya made my laziness vanish and keep me working for SE case study <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> 	<br>I can never forget those old days of 1st sem wen her gud grades wer known in her house and i had to luk 4 sum justifiable reasons to avoid saying my ugly grades in my home <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But tht was gud 4 me...atleast tht way, I had 2 study well the next sem <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> There wer times wen i unknowingly hurt her <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> My sincere apologies 4 tht...but the way she forgets them is truly inspirational <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>And now...the other side of her...the way she maintains her lappy is aaaarrrrgggghhhh! soo shabby! (dunno how is it now....but initially wen i saw it...was devastating!<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) I guess its the innate characterstic of being studious tht drives her 2 b dis way <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Nowadays, she's not even listening 2 classes (Perhaps, I'm the inspiration 4 it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>All said, she's 1 of those wonderful persons who can be trusted and is always der wenever needed <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>I hope u hav a very bright,deserving future and get MS 4m ur dream place <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramya.html>Ramya Yaragani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Although I know that this girl exists in our batch rite 4m day 1, I knew the actual her quite sumtime later in 3rd yr, wen v formed a part of SE project team. When everyone used 2 temme tht she's a gr8 kasi, i thought its jus coz of her CGPA. But no! her quest 2 perform in acads is so infinite tht she made lazy ppl lik me also work during SE <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> wenever its sumthin 2 do wid acads, she's a never-say-no kinda gal <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> its always "go-gal-go" 4 her and deserving enuf, google is tht lucky one to employ her <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>After all this, if neone thinks tht she's nothin but a geek in acads, u r far away 4m right! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She's equally talented in rangoli (dunno how many others in IIIT r upto her levels) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The mono-action performed which imitates a MLA is sumthin i can never forget <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> At the first instance, she mite make one think tht she's a very silent gal. but beware! luks r deceptive <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> if she's becum frndly enuf, she's gonna keep on talking until u run out of topics 2 talk abt <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>In all, she's a wonderful frnd of mine <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> who can make one forget boredom (provided she feels bored then <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and keep talking as if the whole world is der to b talked abt <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Ur kasi will b missed by the entire campus buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Hope....or rather, I'm sure <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> tht u hav an awesum future ahead <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksana.html>sana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He's one of the first persons i've met in campus. During the first 2 years in GHEB, he used to be one of da first few ones who wake up early,go to PT, come back to have the first shower of the day in the floor. He's one guy to invoke activity in ne gathering wer he's present. Either by being a victim 2 sattires by "gopu" <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> or being the creator of sattires on his "soul-mate" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> kirku, he always makes sure tht the environment arnd him is filled up with joy. <br><br>Perhaps, I mite describe him as shortly as his height is <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. The better version mite b with the girls @ srikakulam <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> The craze he has in der is truly mind-blowing! neone wud think only one thing--"Pottodi ki intha scene unda??". But the chats he does wid the girls in his hometown and the fact tht sumone in the campus gave her mail id widout even he asking 4 it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, reveals this concealed trait in him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> His idea of becoming a "sheik" and getting named as "sheik sana" is sumthin i can never forget <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>But on serious note, he's a gr8 guy 2 b with. He is very understanding, gives utmost values to sentiments and makes sure that his frnds r happy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The way he takes all the sattires showered on him by big-wigs like "gopu" and almost all the times,giving a smile as reply is simply gr8 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I hope he gets a better person as his prof and finishes his thesis soon ( jus as his "KASI" wud drive him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). <br><br>I'll definitely miss u wen i'm out of campus dude <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> will meet ya often neways....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Rama Reddy....the name might make one feel tht he's sum sort of "maryada purushottam" but actually, he's kinda different <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (in gud sense only <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) He's my partner in our invincible duo team of "business" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> He's also gud @ sum innovation wen he named a game as "Ramu Chamma" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> At first,wen i met him in my 2nd yr, i thought he's either kinda reserved or must b 2 frank wen answering nething! <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  But he proved me wrong very soon! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> His thinking resonates wid mine in most of the cases and i used 2 b simply amazed @ this coincidence! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> But there's a difference as well...and thts in the time he wakes...never wakes up until i wake him up <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Perhaps, its destined 4 him 2 luk @ my face as soon as he wakes up <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Another difference being tht I'm a singer <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and he's kinda supporting musician 2 our own "music of torture" dedicated 2 our "emperor of counters...GOPU" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Perhaps, one thing tht ne guy wud like 2 learn 4m him is the way he makes others spend wenever he's out with them <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> I din't feel tht situation often...but many a ppl say so <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and guess his byk has learnt the same 4m him...always drinks off petrol as if it's sum kinda beverage. <br>Nowadays, he's kinda worried abt his prof's "requests" to him 2 work. I hope he gets his thesis done in another yr <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I dont think his prof knows abt his football addiction; or else, he'll b praying 2 God 2 make him work <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> With his new hair(band)style, I doubt if girls arnd him wud allow him 2 work <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>But seriously, he's one gr8 frnd i cud hav 4 my lyf! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's so understanding and wenever ne of his frnds is sad or in trouble, the way he consoles or solves their probs is truly superb <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He has a unique charm which makes his frnds listen 2 him and get convinced. He's 1 guy whom i can presume 2 b available wenever i need ne help <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The hardwork he's showing towards organising batch trip <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> is one piece of evidence 4 my presumption. I'm sure tht with his presence, I can enjoy my last batch trip in IIIT in the best possible atmosphere <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> U ROCK MAN!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kiranm.html>Kiran matam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kirku..thts wat he's known as in general..but for ppl who has more chats wid him wud call him wid a different name <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He's 1 guy whom I've never seen getting angry..always has <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> on his face<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's quite studious...oka hand tho Microsoft ni, inkoka hand tho Google ni oke project tho aata aadukunnadu mari <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> but never shows it off! I've been with him for jus more than an year till now, but that's enuf 2 know tht he's a kewl guy 2 b wid <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and the most inspiring thing abt him is da patience he's shown during placements! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> 25 interviews appeared and he's still not vexed up! Kani veedu mabbutanam lo devudu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> aa vishayam vadiki vaade saati <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> the way he said "gud mrng" to his teacher in his childhood <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, the enlightment he gave to his elder bro <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and his desperation 2 get married r unique to himself! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>But all in all, he's a gr8 guy 2 b with..!! U can always b away 4m anger if he's arnd <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> "To laugh, no matter what!" is sth tht every one can learn 4m him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Arey, nuvvu nee mabbutanam rendu rox ra! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Vikas..or shall i say, weakass<img src=Smileys/10.gif />..well, he's 1 guy I've been wid,rite 4m the 1st yr<img src=Smileys/1.gif />He's 1 of da kewlest guys I've known so far.da way he schedules his daily life is truly inspirational <img src=Smileys/77.gif />Firstly, being a hostel resident, he still wakes @6 or 6:30!(v r lucky 2 hav such an alarm 2 wake us up<img src=Smileys/10.gif />)and above this, he has his bath "daily","in the morning"!den,once da clock ticks sumwer near 7:45,he calls us all and pull us to mess.Perhaps,da impossible wish tht I can have is to see sum dust in his room<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> dats the way he keeps his room-- simply crystal clear!<img src=Smileys/77.gif />When it comes to goin out..b it movies or restaurants or a small trip,he's the accountant who comes up wid a pdf of all our expenses<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>One mite perhaps find a clone to him wid all da above features but he has a unique trademark to himself and dats the desperation he has for biryani from Prince or Bawarchi<img src=Smileys/4.gif />He's a "never say no" guy to it<img src=Smileys/10.gif />wenever u want 2 hav it,he's der 2 accompany u<img src=Smileys/4.gif />Another distinct trait that he possesses is da amount of sweat he sheds everyday<img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Even if the fan above his head is @its top speed,he's sweating as if he came after being chased by sum dog<img src=Smileys/4.gif />He's a gr8 fan of Manisharma's music.I hardly remember ne moment wen i saw him listening to ne others' music..dunno wats so fascinating in the copied versions of music tht his music<img src=Smileys/10.gif />(oops! sry vikky..had to tell sum truth abt him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)I came 2 know abt his talent @studies<img src=Smileys/26.gif />a bit late,wen placements started.It became kinda formality to have his name listed in every shortlist dat gets into the mailbox,until he got placed<img src=Smileys/3.gif />da way he analyzes google reader for the latest technology news is sth i always thought of doin but never learnt 4m him<img src=Smileys/2.gif />name ne problem regarding linux,and he's always been der 2 help me wid it<img src=Smileys/6.gif />For 4 full years, I've never seen him showing his anger over neone..mite b argumentative @ sum points,but never offensive<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All in all, he's superb frnd I had throughout my btech life @ IIIT.I cudn't hav asked 4 more than his nature 2 b as my frnd <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> U simply ROCK dude!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kgoutham.html>goutham</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Evadi peru chepte pakkana unna vallapaina counterla varsham kurustundo<br>Evadi peru chepte pulsar bikes NH-7 meeda cut lu kodutu 80 taggavo<br>Evadi perunaithe Ohio,Texas prajalu kalavaristaro <br>Evadini nidra lepalante janalu gaja gaja vanukutaro...<br>Vaade...Vaade... ee Goti alias Gopu alias Goutham! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Well...coming to reality <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He's one guy without whom having our meal in NBH goes boring. With his uncountable counters <img src=Smileys/24.gif />on guys like kiran and sana, he's truly rocking! He's the only one i can remember who can bear with my remix songs <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But beware!! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> He's one piece of lava when he's in the room and either sleeping or watching serials like heroes. But nonetheless, he's a gr8 guy to be a friend with.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> With his flamboyance in the spontaneity of the counters that he showers during our mess time, he's a unique maestro <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>One shud be fortunate to hear them and unfortunate to have them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Goti, neeku leru evvaru saati <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
