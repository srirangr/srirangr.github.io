<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ankush Kalkote A.K.A. Maratha Warrior, my fellow Google intern <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> is one of the best brains of our batch. We all know that he's a 9 pointer but he is not one of those who just mug up all the courses all the time and worry too much about the exams. He could clear CAT examination and get call from IIM-B just after solving a few mock papers on the day before the exam.<br><br>I have admired him all the time due to his calm nature and friendly behavior. In my first year I've known him for AOE and we used to play together often. After I move to cellar in NBH, we became good friends and used to hang out together and have BC sessions quite often. We became close friends when we started doing our intern together. We used to play lots of foos ball/TT during the intern and have fun. Another thing that I like about him is that he also never gets angry ( at least I havent seen him ). Waise though he looks very innocent and decent but he is also very good at pulling other peoples legs <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>You have a long way to go in your life buddy. Now that you'll be joining Google, I hope we will keep seeing other quite often. Good luck and I hope you achieve great success in life.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kiran Danduprolu, or Dandu, is a hardcore gamer <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He plays lots of games and is still too good at each one of them <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, particularly CS <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I remember all the AOE games we played in first year to the CS games we played in summer 2k7 and afterwards. He's a really cool guy. One bad habit that he has is cracking PJ's. He knows a lot about english movies. He's very energetic and is ready for whatever BC/Gaming you call him for. I've been to many outings with him. He also really likes to eat lots of good food and eats out very often <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He also has good knowledge of lots of technologies. The other thing that I really like about him is that he never gets angry and its usually fun when he is around, except for the PJs <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.  <br><br>Although his GPA may not reflect this. He's really smart and quick problem-solver. He got a very good result in CAT without any preparation <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He doesn't care about grades etc otherwise he would have been one of the toppers of our batch. He's a pretty quick and good programmer as well. <br><br>A small message for you: try to take life more seriously, and I know you will go a long way.<br>Will remember you for: CS, VB</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Randeep Singh Banga ( Banga in short ), is a really helpful and friendly person. Very calm, composed mature as well. He's one of the guys I appreciate the most in our batch. I admire him for his hardwork and sincerity. He can sacrifice sleep just for studying for a mid-semester examination <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He's very religious sort of a person. About his helpful nature, he did lots of work during the placement sessions both in terms of helping people learn things, and doing the other necessary work of placement committee.<br><br>You are a really good friend to have, and I will remember you. One thing that I want to tell you is that you should have more fun and dont worry too much about some of the things <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul Dwivedi A.K.A. Chhadami is one of few multi-talented guys of our batch. He's very hardworking guy who will give his 100% to achieve anything that he wants. He's very good at Dholak (in fact he's the only guy I have seen playing Dholak <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), good Guitar player and a good programmer as well. Not to mention his skill at computer games like AOE/CZ/Pacman <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Being house captain of Agni, he's been integral part of most of the cultural activities in campus. He also plays good basketball and been part of his house and our batch's basketball team. Its really hard to imagine so many talents in one person but he has done it. Despite being from a background where he was offered no knowledge of computer science, he worked really hard and done well in his academics at college, and finally got a great job for himself.<br><br>He is one of my best friends at IIIT. I met him on the second day of coming to IIIT and we became friends since then. He was my neighbor at G.H.E.B. in first 2 years of college. I still remember those BC sessions that we had in G.H.E.B. in the beginning days with Kapil, Sainani, Mathur, Rahul Jain. Those days of ragging. He was reallly good at various courses and he taught me almost every course before the exams in first year and second year. After that I stopped bothering even to study one day before the exam <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Most of the whatever marks I got during those days are due to his help. I owe him one for that <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. After that came the holidays after first year, when we became really good friends as we both had stayed at campus during those times. I still remember those days when we had pretty much no work and used to BC all days, eat food in canteen and have lots of fun. I also remember the CZ games I played with him, there was a time when he sucked so much at the game, but has improved a lot now <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>I know you will make a mark in whatever field you touch. Just dont forget your college friends. Be in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Pankaj Saini A.K.A. God-Ka-Baccha (GKB) is a really cool, charming personality. He probably will have more girl friends than I can even imagine <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Hence the nick-name, GKB <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>I didnt have much interaction with him in my first year or second year. But once I moved to cellar in my third year, we have become good friends and have been to many outings together, apart from the BC that we had in coffee shop almost everyday.<br><br>He's pretty good at english and an amazing narrator <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. You will even believe some uber crap when you hear it from his mouth <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Thats the kind of story-teller he is. He also likes to read lots of novels and he has a great knowledge about movies ( be it hollywood or bollywood ), another veteran in antakshari and dumb-charad like games <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>And yeah, how can I forget all those HSSM classes you took before the exams, be it globalization, or industry and society <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The amount of work he has done in any one of these course would be much more than the total work I do on academics on a whole semester <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's usually very goot at making and giving presentations <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>You are also one of the few good friends and guys who have supported me. Thanks for that <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br><br>You really belong to one of the IIM's and I hope you can get there next year. Good luck in life and keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>I know you've got a great future ahead of you and will go a long way to the top. Keep in touch.<br><br>Best Memories: Reinstalling Fedora in first year, hacking people's passwords <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, AOE in first year, summer 2007 CZ and BC everyday. <br>Will Miss you for: <b>Awesome one-liners</b>.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Kulbir Saini, A.K.A. General Bordeaux A.K.A. ($) Chacha.<br><br>He's THE greatest geek of our batch. Extremely knowlegable in Networks and Linux, and he's the one to contact if you have any troubles with the same. Although he has a sticker outside his room saying, Only Fedora - Please dont come for windows XP doubts <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He's very intelligent and determined guy and always works with a plan. Although he doesnt care about his GPA, but he has earned more than anybody in our batch during the college stay itself. He started in first year just like me and many others who didnt have much exposure with computers, but in mere 2 years he knew more than anybody else about Linux and various hardware. 3-1 mein ake inko Networking ka bhoot chadha and he started learning networks day and night <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Or maybe its partly due to no desktop in his room and having only one book at his room <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He soon became the student system administrator at IIIT <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>He was also one of the few friends that I had in my first year, he lived in GHEB, was from Vayu house <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, and had similar interests in computers as me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Remember that little shell script we guys worked on to hack peoples students passwords and the mess it created <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He also used to play AOE with me and he's pretty good strategy wise in the game. I also remember him reinstalling fedora in his pc 2 times a day <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Apart from being a geek, He's also very witty and comes with awesome one-liners. Logo ki maarne mein expert hai and thats the reason isse koi pange nahi leta. About being called chacha, its because He is always RIGHT, everyone else who doesnt agree with him will be considered as ch***** <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He's one of the great BCbaaz in our batch and I will remember you for those countless BC sessions that we had together <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br><br>He's passionate about blogging and maybe photography ( recently after he bought his new camera <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). Also brags about the number of hits per day and the page rank of his website(s) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Another thing to notice about him is his knowledge about movies/songs etc. He's watched more movies then I know the names of and has knowledge of almost all the hindi songs of recent times. Usually wins in Antakshari, Dumbcharads and such competitions all the time. I wish he was from Vayu house <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>I think he's really emotional at the core. You can know about it from his activities after he gets drunk ;-), although I havent had a chance to be with him during any of those occasions, but thats what others say <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>He is also one of the guys who will help me whenever I need it. Remember that Veshno Devi trip, I was too slow in climbing and he was the one who stayed with me for most of the time and encouraged me to complete it <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Many thanks for that buddy <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.<br><br>I hope I will come to blore soon and we'll see each other as often as in college <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Will Miss you for: AOE/BC <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Most Memorable Moments: Veshno Devi Trip, Summer 07 fun and everyday BC.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Sachin Goyal ( nick: icsahn ), also known as Keechad-Kood ( KK in short ) is a very friendly person. He really likes to enjoy his life and is a great person to make friends with. Its usually a lot of fun when he's around.<br><br>I first met him in first year because of AOE <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. We used to play lots of games in first year. Still remember those days <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I didnt have much interaction with him apart from playing AOE together. 2 years passed like this.<br><br>Then came summer 2007, I had more interaction with him. We and other friends used to spend major part of the day ( except sleeping time ) together playing CS all night, then playing VB in the morning. Eating a heavy breakfast, sleeping and then getting up to do BC at college and going to some nice place for dinner, and back to CS again. Those were some of the best fun filled days I had in college. He's an extremely good CS player and I could never match with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>Then comes third year, I shifted to NBH and took a room in front of his room. We have done some AOE and CS gaming together at room as well. I've been to many outings with him he's always ready to have fun with friends and a very jolly person.<br><br>Now in forth year, we have played lots of card games together <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Specially 29. He's really good at this game too.<br><br>Irrespective of all the fun, he's also pretty much a brainy guy. He likes to solve puzzles ( participated in all the cache-in during the various felicities that we had in our stay ). It is also supported by the fact that he managed to get a very good job even during these hard times. [ Don't worry you'll get your offer letter <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ].<br><br>One thing that we both match in is our laziness. Although people might argue ki I'm more lazy but yeh bhi kam nahi hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He never likes to be waken up in his sleep, gets really angry when someone does that to him unnecessarily or even with a reason <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Alok is one of the few people I found in iiit who are really helpful and friendly <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's damn hardworking too <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, he puts his 100% in every course, be it Philosophy or other HSSM crap or some course from core CS. Will do all the necessary work no matter how boring it is <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He not only does the hard work but also helps others and never say no when you ask for some help <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Ofcourse who can forget the work he did during placement days to help people get good jobs.<br>Okay, all this was earlier, he's becoming more and more lazy with time ( specially 8th semester ).<br>One thing I dont like about him is his singing <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. Chahe koi kitni bhi maarle, gana hi hota hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>He's very sporty nature too <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Kisi ki log maar rahe ho to use bachane ke chakkar mein apni marwa lega but will still do the same thing again next time <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>He's one of the few good friends I have in IIIT. Thank you so much for all the BC and fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>I'm sure you'll go a long way in life and do well at whatever you step into. Good Luck.<br><br>Will Miss you for : BC<br>Most Memorable Moments: All the outings, Counter Strike in second year holidays [ Looking forward to the batch trip <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ]<br>Song For you: Yeh Dosti hum nahi todenge <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
