<b>For <a href=nihar.html>Nihar K</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nihar - The best thing ever happened to me in IIIT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>	He is a very nice guy and very helpful. Since from the beginning of first year, he was always there for me during all those tough and hard times I had. For me he is much more than a friend or a brother. He, along with pavan,satish and mohan, they have been everything for me in iiit especially for the last 2 years.<br><br>He is good music listener. Watches lots of movies,tv shows and animes and plays computer  games. For the last and half years his only job is downloading and watching movies/tv shows and playing games <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is too lazy and never go for break fast. He is so lazy in such a way that he even dint update his profile in the year book (I myself updated to write a testi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).But he is very very talented and can grasp things very quickly by just giving a novel read. Reads lot of novels. Reads just before the day of exams and always gets good grades.<br><br>jeevitham lo entho mandini kalusthu untam..kaani ilanti vadini kalusukovadam nizanga na adrustanga bavisthunnanu.<br><br>for me nothing is a great achievement than having friend like Nihar...<br><br>Will be missing u a lot ra..<br>All the Best for ur future!!!<br>with love<br>chakri..<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
