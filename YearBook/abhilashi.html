<b><a href=kabeer.html>Kabeer Singh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>For past the 4 years, we have been in the same team be it college team, batch team, or house team. He was and he is the only person in the team I could always rely on.<br>'Abhilash is defending back there, so it should not be a problem'. He is a powerhouse of energy, never gets tired.  He is a very dedicated person, giving his 100% in whatever he is doing, whether it is sports or academics. <br>He is a versatile player, can play as a center back, LorRback, mid field,CAM or even at the wings. When defending , he is a rock solid defender(only 4 goals conceded -- college team). I can never forget the equalizer in MJIT semi- finals (the timing , the perfection)and of course the finals (where you dint let Abdullah score <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). He was undoubtedly the 'MVP' of the tournament.   <br>An excellent volleyball player too, he even taught me and courtesy him that I played one batch match. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>This would be incomplete if I don't mention that he is a complete all rounder, be it sports, academics , programming or what not. There is a lot that I have learnt from him and a lot that I wanted to. <br>All the very best for your future.<br>And never stop playing soccer.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>        I am sure you are not expecting a testimonial from me. But here I go.<br><br>       I have never spoken to him and I dont really know him at the personal front, as much as his senior female friends know him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> But, I keep calling him <b> research paper churner</b> ..Something gets into his head and comes out as a research paper, I tell him.<br><br>     A brilliant coder, hmm..the word <i> brilliant</i> seems to be an understatement, you were and are and would always be one person I have always looked upto, I respect you from the bottom of my heart for your single minded dedication and indelible efforts towards your goals. People like few things and they stick to it.. Very few people actually bring out the things that they dont like and so openly point them out. You are one of them!<br><br>     He initially came off as quite an arrogant guy. I cannot forget the Felicity campaigning where I was teamed with him and we both gave a tough time to each other, absolutely not listening to each other, fighting and leading to making the whole campaigning a disaster <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>   Wishing you loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>During the initial days I found him as quite an aloof and strange person. Whenever I interacted with him, he spoke only enough words as required! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I got to interact more with him when I took Foundations of Ontological Engg. course under Prof. Navjyoti, with him.<br>As a student, I've always found him quite inquisitive about learning, about the "quest for konwledge". He has always believed and strived for understanding concepts and hence is a great coder. He also takes his sports, soccer, seriously. Once in some course the TA announced timing of tutorial, probably 5pm but this was clashing with his football practice time, so he said so to the TA.<br>Congrats on winning the best allrounder title of the year! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Nice pic BTW. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Will remember you for :- <br><br>1. Aspiring to do something unusual in everything <br>2. Your way approach at solving problems<br>3. g33kiness<br>4. Your dedication towards soccer<br>5. and lots more ....<br><br>This guy has what you call as the "zeal for knowledge" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... Is really a inspiring person, who wants to get 100% out of each course he takes. Will transform a mere discussion to a research paper. Bt on the other hand, he has some negatives too. He will leave a thing in between if he doesnt like it <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> ... At start he plans and will aim for stars but will not even reach the electric pole <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... <br><br>Bt when he gets intrested in something he will fking ace it<br><br>Kudos to you and your dedication .. finish your MS asap <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhilash, one of the allrounders of our batch. He is good at everything he do. Be it academics or sports. One can find him playing every evening. You name the game and he plays it. A multi talented personality. An excellent football player, he plays TT, badminton, basketball, volleyball, cricket and many more. Coming to academics, bond at coding. I can remember, Pagare always telling about his coding skills in the first year. Maintains a decent CG. Initially he was quite cut off from the outer world and one could rarely find him interacting to people. But this aspect has changed a lot after I guess he watched "Happy Days". It takes great courage to convert to dual degree from Btech. Hats off to you for this <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Has won many awards in international and national coding competitions. I must say, he has got a proper research oriented mind.<br><br>No need to say this because I'm quite sure that you will do great in future. Do your MS quickly and go so that we will get a chance to complete our MS <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>God bless you. Good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>u are correct ra about reaching full potential ..<br>but i dont know if i am a hardworker and a good speaker .. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This guy has always inspired me to work hard and be focused on whatever you do. His quest for achieving excellence in every field of life and dedication towards sports is something which I don't see in anyone else around. I also like his commitment to improve the system in which he lives and to encourage others to work for the same. The way his presents his arguments without any fear in mind is something I want to learn. Though we had very few conversations, I enjoyed every single moment of it.<br><br>Good luck for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Abhilash aka Fucker Sucker Licker Di**ker</u><br><br>He must be one of the biggest geek around who also excels in sports. The guy is known in most circles (except his close friends) as a geek who loves studying and who plays football well. Even I cannot claim to being a close friend of him now. Its very rare that either of us see the other these days, he being in NBH and busy in his research and all. We sort of started veering in different directions which resulted in almost nil interaction, and I think both of us being satisified with the way their lives were going, so none of us saw any need to change things around and things just kept going their way.<br>The first intro I had with this guy was as soebody who lived near Pagare's room, who Pagare intoduced me to. <br><br>For the whole first year, he was the only telugu speaking guy in group which at times used to be sort of inconvinient to him, specially when we used to go and watch Hindi movies. I still remember he came to watch some Hindi movie with us. Outings with him used to be some fun, he would invariably be playing football when we made the plans about any outing. As a result he wasnt made aware of any such trips, until the 11th hour which meant that, at times he came for outings in shorts and t-shirts all sweaty and dirty after a gruelling session of football.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Almost the whole batch knows him as the geek, the dedicated person, who continues to puzzle people by his dedication to strive for studies. He would always be thinking about this theory or that subject. He was always the one thinking about new ways to do things. One thing about him has been that he always dreamed big when it came to projects, a habit which I too picked up from him, resulting in Text to Image Conversion (our Hons. Project in LTRC <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I have always been amazed at his passion for studying and research, which suffered just a minor dent when he saw "Happy Days". I clearly remember me and him sitting in LTRC lab and he kept talking about how he wanted to "<b>enjoy</b>" his life. He wanted to have a <b>GIRL FRIEND</b> (which reminds me there was somthing going on for him in 2nd yr or so, some family frnd.. What happend man?? <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). That was ROFL stuff man!! Awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> That was the talk of the town for long.... Abhilash gettting frustrated <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br><b>Advice:- Man you dream too big and then veer off to altogether different tangents, try and concentrate on one thing at a time <br>Fav Moment :-Definitely the talk we had after you saw Happy Days and all the planning we did for our Project <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b> <br><br>Cheers <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Very enthusiastic and energetic and most importantly very dedicated to whatever he does. One word that strikes my mind whenever I see him is "Kasi". Be it soccer or studies or coding or even HSSMs, never gives up. A <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to his dedication. He also maintains a Schedule of what to do and when to do. And I salute you for following it preperly <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> (seriously man, I've made many shcedules in my life but never followed a single one.Its not everyone's cup of tea) A <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to you.

Presently, a medium-sized fruit is growing on that tree. That, my dear, is Abhilash. Yes, you're right! He is the Jackfruit in the making (our future logo will have a small fruit on it). This fruit plays footer, comes up with interesting algorithms and is single, that means...ready to mingle, chicha! We published a C2D paper, did loads of traveling in railway bogies, participated in awesome contests, attended numerous Barcamps for 'theendi' and um..excuse me -- I'm not that good at total recall or thanksgiving, for that matter -- anyways, we did some really cool shit together, yeah.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abhilash or 'abhilashi' is not an easy person to understand. Trust him to never stick to the cliches and do his own thing. Who can ever forget the frankness he has with the professors in the class? Especially Zulu <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He has a bit of a habit of questioning authority and thinking deep about stuff which he'd do. <br><br>I admire Abhilash for some of these things. He is an intelligent guy who'd put in all the work required for achieving his goals. I admire him for his academics and his coding skills. He is also a very good sportsperson. If you want to find him in the evenings, you have to go to the ground. He plays very good volleyball and football. <br><br>We were good friends in the first two years. Staying near NBH-47, he'd often help us out with all a lot of academics related stuff. We also hung out together, I particularly remember one incident when he came to a resturant in shorts <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I also recall FSLD (rofl)- fucker, sucker and the like; his awesome style of speaking, Mrs. Marathe's classes etc. Things changed after that when we moved to OBH and he didn't. Also, I was not happy with his work in Felicity '08- I expected a whole lot more from him. I guess that pushed us furthur apart. <br><br>But all in all, I still respect him for a lot of things, and hope we can stay friends for a long time.
