<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Remember the first day and how the registration went? It all began there with me, Tejaswi, PK and Himank standing right behind each other. Himank was the guy who bitched the most and cursed the administration for taking things so slow. His popularity in first year can be seen from the fact that he (with Rama Reddy) was the bakra of section B. Any anything happened and he would be given bumps for no reason at all <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> One must also not miss out on the hair style he had during those days. If you ever get the pics of independence day celebrations of 2005, do check out his hairstyle. Totally hilarious <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> An honorary mention should also be made regarding his love for Preity Zinta in first year. He had this huge collection of Preity Zinta wallpapers which he used to so shamelessly flaunt <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>He loves doing BC, talking about stuff around. He realized it in first yr. itself that he can do BC with at max 4-5 people in the wing but if he uses a blog, he can reach out to a wider set of audience <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and thus started his blogging days. He is one of the most prolific bloggers and his name is sure to come first if history textbooks ever talk about blogging + UG2k5.<br><br>Throughout these four years he has taught me loads of stuff and for this reason becomes my guru. He taught me the right way to drink beer, smoke cigarretes and take neat vodka shots. Introduced me to the world of Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley. He is also pretty cool and handles difficult situations pretty well - one more thing I learnt. This list just goes on endlessly and I'm sure many others also regard him as a guru <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We were in great contact when he was in NBH and me in GHEb and then from 3rd year onwards when we became "adjacent-wing" mates, we've known each other so much more. Tomorrow when he goes away I'll really miss his occasional BC, his jokes, his sarcasms, but most of all - him. Here's wishing him best of luck in whatever activity he takes up. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>most memorable moment - I, Raman and Himank drinking beer on the road. Police comes and catches us. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Divya aka k-d adds a kth dimension to the gang of girls. Now I myself don't know what that means... people pull arbit crap, I am also trying something <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Ok... so when I started writing this testimonial, i thought... "ae come on yaar", what should I write about her. Just the other day, while chatting I told her - "Muchchatullu chepukundama?" to which she replied, "adi maa ooru lo sollu kottaram antaru." Half the time, I chat with her 'coz I love the mass language that she uses. Yay! that's one thing I'll remember Divya for. Plus her one-liners. They are so totally witty! Specially the ones targeted at Bhargava, Gopal and Samrat. How often have I tried in the past few weeks to get a balcony ticket to watch this one-liner show <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Unfortunately I've only managed dress circle tickets which means I'm also in the targetlist <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Though we used to talk pretty often in first yr., about all sorts of arbit things (she has awesome english + a great voice which makes her a very good speaker) but we lost the connection in the subsequent years and in fourth year, I came to know about her in totally different light. I'm sure I'll know a lot more about her. Here's wishing her all the best in whatever activity she takes up. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>But the best part is how she manages work. As far as managing work in general goes, I can say without doubt that Deepti is one step away from being ideal. I have often (and will happily, greedily and shamelessy) continue to bank on her for advice in this dept. She has always been critical of my slacking nature, best examples being the computer vision course and my C grade in it and the GE paper fiasco. I only hope that she never gives up on me. All in all, a great person from whom I've learnt a ton of stuff and I'm sure she would say the same about me. I'll never forget all the escapades we had like stalking girls, watching plays and the frequent outings to Reliance fresh. Looking back, going through all the stuff we did together (in FF mode), it really feels great to say that she's a great friend of mine. You go girl!! We all know that for you sky is not the limit but a point from where you can start! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>sashidhar</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Apart from the usual exchanges of hi and hello, we never really talked to each other till the end of second year. That's when I, Maruti and Deepti were assigned project mates. At that time, all I knew about deepti was that she is this gal totally into studies and all. Our relation was on a very impersonal level and it continued to be so before changing to the bc stuff and all. Hell! I'll never know when the transition took place. Maybe the entire Felicity video making experience was a big catalyst but there were other things as well. Soon our discussion would be more of celebrity gossip, TV shows, news, etc. and less of project work. During the entire project episode, I came to know how very systematic she is, meticulously planning everything and making clearcut agendas and plans. A point worthy of mention here is that she can always be trusted for taking up responsibilities, whether it is organising some b'day party or getting people to come for a meeting.<br><br>I often use this technique of putting myself in the shoes of so and so person and thinking from his/her point of view. But in case of deepti, it has always been difficult for me because she is so radically different from me. I'm a born slacker. She is a born push-er and has it in her to push an idea and make sure it turns from something abstract (on paper or pdf or ppt) to something solid. She loves taking charge of things around her, being (a wee bit) bossy and all. Wait a minute! Did I say a wee bit bossy? She is so totally bossy!! Add to it her frankness. She will definitely give you her peice of mind if you don't work by her standards <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Plus her fundaes. She has one for every thing, ranging from weight loss to fashion tips, basically anything.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd...<br><br>In first year, she used to sit right in front of me. It was so hilarious to see the stuff she used to do. She used to poke sainani when he was asleep, sometimes mimic the prof., or mostly engage in faltoo, timepass conversation. In workspace, she had her computer right behind me. Her computer was a big dabba and I was her trusted technical support. Though this connection was lost in the subsequent years, we still got/get to have those arbit, faltoo, timepass discussions. In these four years, I've learnt a lot of stuff from her but the one thing that stands out is her ideas of friendship. I remember that once in first year, she told me how she felt bad about dividing the sections into two because a lot of her friends were in the other section and she was missing out on a lot of fun. A sentiment I could not really relate to properly until the beginning of second year. That's when I realized how close she is to her friends and how she actively seeks their company.<br><br>In the end I should say that in these four years I've come to know tons of stuff about her and I'm sure I'll get to know a lot more. When decided on a goal to achieve, she has it in her to put umpteen dedication to make it happen and with that spirit here's me wishing that she meets success and gets what she wants. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>sashidhar</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I often see Harshita calling a guy or gal cute, with the number of people she calls cute tending to infinity. If you ask me, I'll say that most of them are not even half as cute as her. I still don't understand why she abondoned her cuteharshi email id. Of all the people I've known for sometime, the "child in her" is the most pronounced. Whether it is doing awesome mimicry (do you know she does very good mimicry of me and sharat), or asking the kind of wierd doubts children generally ask in that please-tell-me-too tone. She's very curious about the stuff around her and tries to get to the bottom of it. On top of all this she sings and dances pretty well. It's so awesome to watch either of these two as the amount of energy she puts in both these activites is really out of this world, yet making it look so effortless.<br><br>Too bad Oxford and Cambridge don't know who harshita is. If they had known, their definition of extrovert would most probably have been what harshita is. She is so full of energy when around people. She is extremely outgoing. After all you see she was the Ms. Fresher of our batch. But the mindboggling thing is how many people she knows. In harshita's case, she can go to a group of people and effortlessly join their discussion, something I'm sure I can never do. This awesome quality of hers plus the afore mentioned quality of getting to the bottom of the matter at any cost often helps her in getting the inside scoop as far gossip is concerned. But the bad part is that if she knows it, entire GH will probably know it by the end of the day. I've often said this and I still stick to it that telling something to harshita is like knocking every single door in GH and telling it.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Karan Maroo was the second guy I met when I first came to IIIT-H. Within minutes of meeting each other, we started talking about Harry Potter(the 6th instalment was out the day before) and how the story would turn out. Just the other day, when we were chatting, he added in a few more details like how he managed to convince me that Hermione dies in the end, a proof of the fact that he is pretty good at convincing people. Maybe someday he can become some kind of a lobbyist. But all that was like in ancient undocumented history. The part that I'll never forget is the Nov-07 to Feb-08, during the run-up to Felicity and Felicity itself. At times, I had seen him take some real hard decisions and it was/is inspiring to see that those decisions paid off in the end. The session after Felicity was great as well, with a few emotional moments which only strengthened our friendship.<br><br>During these four years, he has met with a lot of success (for which he worked with so much of dedication and discipline) and I hope it continues for a long, long, long time to come. He has the attitude and the aptitude to make it to a high altitude. Ten years down the line, I'm sure he'll be this big shot business guy. His home full of sai baba portraits, his shelf full of books like 'Who Moved My Cheese', 'The Monk Who sold his Ferrari', 'Argumentative Indian', etc., etc., (you catch the drift right!)<br><br>Memorable moments: a) 2nd half of 3rd year (the felicity semester) and b) the mail which he sent in 2nd year immediately after Freshers.</b></i></ul><br><br>
