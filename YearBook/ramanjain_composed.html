<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Piyush apna mota aka mumma!!!<br><br>Well!!! the first word that comes to my mind when I think about this guy is "emotional"<img src=Smileys/26.gif />.. he is a hard core emotional person and never takes things in a light way, har daru party me bahut rota hai, aur to aur iski "naak" bhi roti hai<img src=Smileys/21.gif />..We have been shared same wing for the last 3 years and We are adjacent neighbours for the last 2 years.He is very good human being, achieved lots of things in his life like he is very good at art, played a vital role in the felicity 09, worked very hard for his house<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ...and so on .... <br><br>Despite the fact that he din't do well at the academices in the first year, but later this "amazon" guy worked his arse off, and shown his true colour from the 2nd year and studied every subject very well and finally got the best job of this session<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I remember in 3rd year, when we had taken same CVIT courses and we were always studied together. In the exam time, I used to start teaching him, but due to his extra-ordinary thinking ability, I don't know how it happened but last me ye mujhe padane lag jata hai<img src=Smileys/20.gif />.<br><br>Hes great person but somtimes takes too much stress<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> and makes things messy between himself and his friends(khaas kar ki mere saath)<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> but its okay !!!! har relation me kuch naa kuch fight to hoti hi hai. He is a friend in need, never say "NO" to anyone(khaas kar ki bandiyo ko<img src=Smileys/10.gif />). But seriously I had a great time with you throuout these four years, specially in 3rd year. I will definitely remember you as one of my good friends. <br><br>Believe me You are a great guy but only a few changes is required !!!!<br>Best of luck... You have a great life ahead!!!!  <br>      </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Srirang aka DJ ranga !!!<br><br>This guy truely makes justice to the line "Can't be ignored", as far as I know hes been friend of each one of the 176 students of our batch<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> which is undoubtably a great feeling. <br><br>In IIIT, Dj nights can't be complete without this guy. I never talked to him in the first couple of year but when we moved to OBH in 3rd year then we started to know each other, I found he is a cutipie baby, very jovial in nature who always keeps smile on his face. I often go to his room to eat something, banda humesha pura khane ka saaman khol ke rakh deta hai... thanks range for all those sweets and namkeens that I ate at your room.<br><br>seriously dude you are a great guy !!!!<br>may you fly higher in your future !!!!<br>keep in touch!!! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Shrikant aka ganja aka Aksay kumar<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...<br><br>Expressing this guy is like saying many cool and bindas words one by one. He is the hell of an interesting personality<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. This smart and dashing guy from Aazamgad is one of the best persons to spend time with. He got stunning looks coupled with a dude hairstyle. His dressing sense is always been appreciable. <br><br>Isliye hum log is bande ka tanka har bandi se jod dete<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> hai aur ishi karan we call him Aksay kumar<img src=Smileys/24.gif /> instead of Akshay because he is from a village.<br><br>He wasn't quite good at studies but he worked his arse off and managed to get a very good job that is a remarkable achievement indeed<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He did many things for IIIT like played for basketball's college team, played a vital role in felicity 09 and also started a new culture of photography<img src=Smileys/26.gif />. He becomes very active when he got his camera in his hand and starts to capture every mobile moments. <br><br>I had share lots of funny memories with him. We shared same wing through out our four year. He's been a very good pal for me, except for some moments when we din't want to see each other faces<img src=Smileys/14.gif />. I don't understand why it happens but after some time we starts talking to each other and I think this special characteristics makes our friendship stronger<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. I would definitely miss you a lot but as you will be here in hyderabad, we'll have lot more fun together.<br><br>Best of luck for your future!!!<br>Will keep in touch with you definitely!!!       <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Manish Arora aka jaat aka phodu ...<br><br>It's a great honour to wirte a testimonial for this gentleman<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is a gem of a guy, an outstanding person, an extraordinary simple guy who believes in doing only good things. It's been four years with him now and I couldn't be able to figure out even one wrong or bed characteristic of him<img src=Smileys/20.gif />. I really respect him for whatever he do. I visit his room very often(can say twice in a day) he always suggests me do right things and that really motivates me a lot<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>Nowdays, he is known as "novirus", because of his odd way of playing CZ<img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He is a multi-talented guy, jis bhi cheej me ek baar ghus jata hai ushe complete karke hi chodta hai, be it gaming, studies, playing volleyball, body building, gossiping<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is a kind of person, who believes himself, never cared what people thinks about him, but he do things which he likes, saale ko kitna force kiya hoga logon ne peene ke liye but nahi to nahi ...<br><br>The "Micro"<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> man helped many batchmates at the time of placement by teaching them several subjects..and I believe that ki is bande se jyada achchi OS koi nahi pada sakta IIIT me<img src=Smileys/77.gif />.. he deserves to be a batch topper indeed!!!  <br><br>Jab bhi main isse milta hun aur baat karta hun, ye kuch naa kuch aisa bolta hai jisse main iski naa chahe ke bhi ishi ke samne isiki taarif kar hi deta hun aur ye bhi sochta hun ki .. koi kaisa itna achcha ho sakta hai<img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .. seriously manish, I feel very proud to have you as one of the closest buddy around here.<br><br>keep in touch !!!<br>may you fly higher in future.<br>still much more fun than ever has to come in your life!!!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>chand bhai aka chand uncle<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>The word "UG2K5" is incomplete and meaningless without this guy. He is the backbone of our batch. There is a saying "God is everywhere", I would like to say it differently "Chand is everywhere in IIIT"<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He gave a lot to IIIT like organized almost all functions, worked more than CR can do for our batch, throw a many dance performances and acts, won the title of "Mr. Fresher", secured a good rank in SPOJ, played a vital role in Felicity 08 & 09 & many more.. this list is endless<img src=Smileys/13.gif />.<br><br>I was really amazed to see his snaps, when he was in 1st year, he was fat<img src=Smileys/24.gif />, had worst dressing sense and wore thick glasses. But now he became one of the most good looking guy of our batch aur ultimate dolle shole bana liye hai<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. I remember the recent incident happened in Club8, where after getting drunk he self-praised and said "yaar bhagvaan ne bahut takat di hai raman tu jahan kahega jise kahega vaha use marne ke liye pahuch jaunga tu bas 1 call kar dena", this shows how much he loves us and treats us like his little brothers... that is why I really respect him alot<img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>A friend in need, he never said NO to anyone and always ready to help us, aur emotion to thus thus ke bhare hue hai isme, jab bhi daru peeta hai bahut rota bhi hai aur fir kisi naa kisi ke pass beith kar apni cheeje sort out karta hai. <br><br>I misunderstood him till 3rd year and never wanted to talk to him because I used to think that he don't accept me as one of the TBian but later I realized that I was totaly wrong. I really do care for him and I believe that he cares for me as well<img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Now only countable days are left, I wish I could go to past and share alot more with him, which I was unable to do. Seriously chand I want to tell you that I really feel sorry for all I did wrong to you, bachcha samaj ke maaf kar dena<img src=Smileys/5.gif />.

Jab bhi milta hai humesha kuch naa kuch humorous bhari line kahe hi deta hai jisse honton pe hasi aa hi jati hai.. <br><br>He was very closed to me in the first couple of year but later I moved in OBH so couldn't meet him regularly, but seriously those days were just amazing and always want to have them back...he used to often come to my room at that time, khaas kar ki exam ke time ..one thing I noticed that jab bhi main ishe kuch bhi explain karta tha aur agar ishe samaj nahi aata tha .. he dont used to ask me to explain it again rathar haan me haan milata jata tha chahe samaj me aaye yaa naa aaya...aur jab last me pahuchta tha samjate hue tab saala pahele wali cheeje puchta hai ... this is why He got C in C, D in DS, and so on.....<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>A total travel freak, who've visited many parts of the world aur ishe puccho ki kya kya dekha waha ... then He starts telling the story in a very interesting way(pura mirch masala lagakar<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) that even sota hua banda bhi ushe sun leta hai... seriously a great talent in expressing feelings ..I have never seen this talent in anyone else.<br><br>He becomes very active when it comes to arranging batch trip or any outings, and he always makes the trip unforgetable. Banda sabse banake bhi rakhta hai chahe koi iske kaam aaye yaa nahi aaye(ye bahut kam hota hai vaise<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) ... this is also one another quality of him, which I have never seen in anyone else!!! But He is very good at heart, kabhi doosro ka katta nahi hai haan ye alag baat hai ki unse kaam nikalvaleta hai kaise bhi karke<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>daddu kamine kabhi bhoolna mat !!!<br>and be the same atleast for me!!!!  <br>may you fly higher!!!... <br><br><br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Vipul Mittal aka beepul bai aka apna buddha.....<br><br>Ye banda sahi me alag hi hai, an outstanding person<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. In our first year when We got to know each other, I realized he would be the perfect one with whom I can share my room...at that point I was totly right,I couldn't have better room partner than him. I really cherished first couple of year a lot because of him and the sharing box concept aur us time jab hum dono mil jate the to PK aur bhalu aur maruti ki bahut lete the. This guy trully makes justice to the word "sajjan or shushil or gharelu<img src=Smileys/24.gif />"....<br><br>banda kabhi kisi ke liye galat nahi soch sakta even if one hurt him very badly. A true helpful person, humesha kisi naa kisi ki madad karta raheta hai. He never cared what other people thinks about him, but some times he becames short tempered when someone makes fun of him<img src=Smileys/10.gif />, in reply back, he restricts himself to talk to that person for quite long time...yeah!!! that "someone" person is me<img src=Smileys/20.gif />, but its his nature which is not bad because every one has certain limit....<br><br>humesha kisi se kuch mann ki baat nahi kaheta hai even if something is hurting him very deeply, but he has changed drastically in the last two year, which is quite surprising ....started drinking passionately, bahut bc karne laga hai aur to aur aajkal to logo ki leta bhi hai khas kar ki Chand ki<img src=Smileys/21.gif />!!!! Seriously ye banda aisa hai ki iske bare me koi kabhi galat soch hi nahi sakta. I truly respect this guy from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>He is a great dancer too aur jo iska performance tha "nain lad jaiyo" song pe that was undoubtably fantabulous. When I look back, he din't have many friends except some, but now the count keeps increasing that shows how much he changed in the last two years...  since you are not leaving college as other's so chahekar bhi emotional baatein nahi likh paa raha hun....That is it!!! <br><br><br>one liner for him -> ek madadgaar jo kahin pe kaise bhi kisi ki bhi madad kar sakta hai<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ....hehaheha...</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>CHIRAG aka chiku aka CCC aka Pornstar <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ............<br><br>Whenever I see him, first thing that comes into mind is his dedication towards everything, be it studies, movies, sitcoms, BCes or even body building<img src=Smileys/77.gif />. In the first year, he seemed to be very innocent but later I realised he is just opposite<img src=Smileys/13.gif />, a quick witted guy who is always ready to leofy everyone whenever he gets a chance, never ever miss it. vaise to He is quite calm, never share a lot but jab koi party yaa outing hoti hai sab se jyada josh me yahi raheta hai ......khas kar ki jab daaru peene jate hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif />tab to ye overexcited ho jata hai ...aur sab ki gande walli leta hai .....<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>Whenever I need somebody to talk to on any subject, be it studies or gossip, I choose him in the top list...Aur iske fhatto ki to kya hi baat karu <img src=Smileys/41.gif />....bahut fhatte marta hai chupke se aur kisi ko kano kaan khabar bhi nahi lagti.. but very often he cracked awesome jokes as well ...hats off to you for that....<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He is one of the most sincere guy in IIIT and if I would have the right to give an award for the most consitent performer then he would probably be the winner and that is why he also managed to maintain a good CGPA and a decent job too which is quite admirable. He has a peculier style of saying "abe shaniwar ko chalte hai" whenever I ask him to go out on weekdays<img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br><br>His presence in any situation makes the whole environment very light. Many a times he has been the reason for our laughs, humesha kuch bachkani harkat karta hai aur to aur lagta bhi bikul bachche jaisa hai. Ye ek aisa banda jiski sab se banti hai aur kisi se kabhi ladai nahi karta hai ...always been good to others.. but kabhi kabhi mujhse ladta hai<img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but baad me sab kuch settle ho jata hai ... but really dost!! sorry for every fight which occured between us.. tu bhi janta hai whatever I did wrong at that time, I din't mean it ... kuch galtiya ho hi jati hai .... <br><br>(cont...)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Now he's been staying in a room which is adjacent to mine, and never closes his door when he is there in his room and so people very often visit his room <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. As the time passed from 1st to 4th year, he's becoming more and more mature and responsible and he handles his issues very calmly and I really appreciate that. I have never seen him upset for something for more than a few hours. He is the one who knows everything about my ups and downs. Our bonding is becoming more strong as the time is passing and we often do emotional BC when he uses many uncommon hindi words. Some times he irritates me for no reason by commenting something but I know he doesn't mean it and do this just for fun. In our 3rd year I recognized his one more talent - leadership,  when he did a commendable job in felicity and single handidly managed the cultural work. His anchoring in the Rock show was full of energy that made him the best anchor for rock show till date.<br>Seriously pappu tujh jaisa banda dekha nahi hai aaj tak.... thanks for everthing....<br>may god bless our friendship!!!<br>plzzz .. kabhi bhulna mat saale... <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br>A great future is waiting for you ... <br><br>Hats off to you pal !!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Character he resembles : Ranbir Kapoor (aajkal banda hero ban chuka hai ... 1 in Sawariya and 3 in Bachna e haseeno ... aisa hi kuch ho raha hi iski life me <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> )<br><br>For you written by me :-Abhijeet Pagare !!!<br> 	                Gardish me hai tere sitare !!!<br>                 	jeele has le gaa le muskurale !!!<br>         	        Hum rahenge humesha saath tumhare !!!<br>         	        Chahe tu jeete yaa tu haare !!! 	<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>He becomes very passionate when it comes to cricket, a deadly fast open bowler of the IIIT main team and he also played for MP's under 14 club, a great achievement indeed <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and a mobile wikipedia for any cricket queries, always ready to have debate on any stuff related to cricket. I happen to believe that if he could not have made it to any engineering college, he would have been playing for the current Indian team since one of his club teammate plays in IPL. <br><br>He is a very good looking guy and has a nice sense of dressing but bechara apni naak se dukhi raheta hai. I always try to leofy him but due to his quick witted replies everything goes against me, has a great sense of humor, he has always been the reason for making us laugh. To lighten the mood, everytime he tries to come up with something (mostly crapy) which makes everyone laugh. He has a typical style of asking people to think upon something like " teri 5 best actresses kaun kaun si hai " or " tere 5 sabse gande incident kaun kaun se hai" or "tujhe IIIT me 5 sabse achchi bandiya kaun kaun si lagti hai" and this sometimes calls a debate.  <br><br>These days he has become very careful about his diet and he desperately want to have six packs <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> and that killer attitude forces me too to have a decent physique but I am so lazy that don't go to gym regularly <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He is a total freak of English movies and watches only classic movies and recommended me some very good movies, I thank him for this. Whenever he watches a movie with someone, he always go to sleep and behaves like he has understood the story and keeps on arguing on some incident of the movie and often makes a different story out of it ..... poor chap!!!      <br><br><br>cont...<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhijeet Pagare Alias "Pappu" or "Paggu" or "bhopali"!! We met each other through Kabra <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> ,so thanx to Kabra for that .... <br><br>Seriously this man is a total stud, an absolute meaning of friend, always keeps himself active and sparked. I seriously feel very proud to have him as my best buddy around here. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I have lots of funny and emotional memories associated with him and obviously I played the main role in most of them <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ...  I really didn't think that we would share this much of bonding when I met him for the first time because I used to be very conservative type of a person before coming to IIIT. <br><br>In my first year whenever I was little worried <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> about some subjects, I always used to come to his room to get some advice and he always tried to help me out(sahi me pappu agar tu nahi hota to mera kya hota). We studied together for almost all the common courses and I am telling you he is a damn intelligent. Even though he didn't study much, he finally managed to hold a decent CGPA and a decent job offer with one of highest paid packages. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He spend most of his time in doing BC and never gets fulfilled with it and that is why his room NBH-47 was the most famous room for quite sometime in the first two years and his was the favourite venue for BC. <br><br>A great dancer with some peculiar steps which later used by us on many DJ nights. I can never forget the song 'Ari Ari' on which he has performed many times in the first three years, and all performances were a big time hit <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br><br>Cont...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
