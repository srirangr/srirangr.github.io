<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nauty.<br><br>Garhwali. Bahut hi quiet sa banda hai, and very well built too. Jab main is se mila, to mujhe bahut saari ummeedein bandh gayi thi... ki ye banda bhi mere type ka hoga. Iske gaon ja ke haseen vaadion mein kho jayenge aur vahaan ke culture ko dekhenge etc etc. But later I realized that this Pahari, who can also start looking like a mountain ox on a week of gymming, is not at all adventurous by nature. This incidence taught me a few lessons about individuality in life.<br><br>Nauty has been a really hardworking guy. He has made a lot of sacrifices for his studies, something I truly admire him for. His skills I was able to see during the course of a Graphics assignment I took his help for, and I have respected his acads after that. So much so that when I got placed earlier than him, I felt as if I had somehow cheated him and a few others like him of their jobs. Survivor's guilt. Dude, you have no idea how much of a relief it was for me when you got placed.<br><br>A nice sketcher, he also appreciates art. I had one poetry reading session with him and was amazaed at how quickly he caught the essence of the poems - something I always have difficulty doing. I wish we saw more sketches from you.<br><br>We have something in common - a burning desire to see more of the world. You can count on me to try my best to accomodate a trip, anytime. All the best for your future. I'm sure you will make all of us proud.<br><br><b>Memories:</b> Talking to you.<br><b>Tags:</b> Garhwal, GHEB, Agni.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><center><b>A friend in need is a good friend indeed</b></center><br>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal alias Naughty is one of my friends who justifies the above statement. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Whenever I have asked him for help, he neither refused me nor made any excuses.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> We built a good friendship right in the first year of our college life.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> As he was a a very studious student before coming to the college (AIEEE AIR - 345 justifies that<img src=Smileys/77.gif />), he continued to be the same in the first year. He used to catch cold almost every year after coming to the college, and that even proved to be a slight hindrance in his studies. <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  In spite of that, he used to teach me a few subjects in the first year. I still remember "RAID" taught by him.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> Then we had a trip to Ooty, Munnar etc. in our second year which strengthened our friendship.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> We enjoyed a lot in that trip. We even won "Kahani mein Twist" during Felicity'07.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> In third year, we even organised "Kahani Mein Twist" during Sunday Carnival. Similarly, we did many things together such as .. Going to Nalsar's Annual Fest etc.<br>But I did not know why our friendship did not run as well in our fourth year <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> as in the previous three years. Possibly because that time, he was more conscious about his placements.<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> Now in a last few days of our college, we are together again.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /> In these days, either we watch out movies @ night in my room or we listen to some melodies.<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>That was just a short description of our friendship.<br>In addition to being a great student, he is a good artist. You could see most of his paintings on his blog. And he even boosted my confidence for writing posts. I love a few Gharwali songs which he made me to hear.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One I love most is -- "Satura Ki Dhauni"<br>At the end, I just want to say ..<br>Our friendship is not limited to four years.. it is a bond between both of us for an unlimited period of time. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>I wish you achieve whatever you aim in your life. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nauty ... A hardcore Garhwaali ... literally a down to earth guy ... Garhwaal ke bare mein kuch bura nahin sun sakta... Sale ne bahtu pakaya tha garhwaali gane sunakar ... and maine tujhe Swades dekhkar ... Timetable ban jaata hai kabhi kabhi ... <br>The thing is he used to stay in GHEB in summers ... and me in NBH(single) ... bechaara bahut bolta tha ki bhai main nbh aana chahata hun ... main tere saath reh lunga ... and blah blah ... <br>He persuaded me somehow (mind you! I dont get persuaded easily) .. but his condition was really something ... SO I let him stay in my room ... and after that we became good friends ...

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nauty saab.. A very silent and shy kind of a person. He likes to stay within himself, and takes a lot of time to open up. Hes also very mannered and a humble chap.. comes with his basic nature I guess <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I enjoy his sketches a lot, they have a lot of heart in them. I think he should keep pursuing this talent of his.<br><br>We discuss Virender Sehwag a lot on the mess table.. Hes a hard core fan of his. Cannot hear a word against the Nawab of Najafgarh! We've had so many discussions, but finally Nauty has had his way. Sehwag is back to the form of old <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I also remember placements time.. I told him that you get placed in the 5th company which interviews you.. And lo! It proved right for him too. You owe me one for that dude!<br><br>All in all, a very nice person and a good friend.<br><br><b>Fav memory: Discussing Sehwag <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Yogesh aka Nautiyal aka Nauty aka Garhwali</u><br><br>Nauty apna Garhwali bhai, came to know him in the first year itself when we both were in the B section. Thats when I came to know of this guy who hails from Garhwal. A relation is always forged itself if you come to know that the guy hails from the same place where you have lived for five years, a place you are in love with. In our case <b>Uttarkashi</b> was the connection. I lived in that place for 5 years and his village is situated in the same district, we have had so many conversations discussing the place and <b>Garhwal</b> in general. I always enjoyed when in first (or was it 2nd ) year when he would show me some Garhwali videos on his mobile though I dont understand garhwali but It always felt like going back to the times which I enjoyed so much. <br><br>The guy is one of the smart chaps in our batch, body shoddy mast banai hai bande ne. Banda has always been a fodu in academics, his AIEEE rank bears a testimony to the fact.All in all a nice person to have been in touch with. <br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future.<br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Naughty, Arjun Rampal as some people call him, he is smart, very hardworking <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />, poetic , sentimental and sincere kind of guy. He along with paro, daddu and alok were the ppl who started preparing for Placement and ask/force others to do so  First year known him only as a guy who is locked in his room by his roommate  <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> but during Kerala Trip spl. Ooty mein khub mazze kiya the <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Spl. Tea factory se niche utarne mein . He is among those who speaks very less but kabhie-2 bomb fodte hain jab bolte hain to <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Us trip mein he told us many of his sayari, I still remember that "delhi chali gayee" wali sayari . He is the one in trip who note down every little incident of the trip in my notebook, I hope I still have that diary <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Music appreciation ki class main mein bore hota tha toh ise hi pkata tha, in class he was all sincere and always wants to listen to prof. One thing I appreciate him for is his self-confidence (although kabhie-2 overconfident sa ho jaata hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) but still his belief he thinks he can do is worth praising <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>All the best dude for all your future endeavor.<br>As you are placed in B'lore, we will meet often and surely have a nice time there as well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>So, keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Backup, Shayari<br>Most Memorable moments : - Kerala Trip.<br>Msg for U: - Be li'l more flexible.<br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nauty, one of the few people I met during my first week at IIIT-H. For almost the whole<br>first year, I saw him wearing only full sleeves shirts, then suddenly one day he wore a t-shirt and there was no looking back since that day. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He loves talking about his home place, Garhwal and made me listen to some Garhwali songs (I'm sorry but I couldn't appreciate them because I didn't know what they meant, but the videos were quite interesting and reflected their culture in a subtle way so watching the videos of those songs was a nice experience).<br>In first year, he was my neighbor in workspace and had a speaker in his computer system. So he used to play bollywood songs, some which he liked and some which I liked. He bought a mobile phone with camera in 2nd semester and was one of the first guys in my floor to buy a laptop. His mobile phone has been very useful in 2nd semester and 2nd year. The picture in my yearbook profile has also been taken by his mobile camera. Watched many movies in 2nd semester on his laptop when many of us didn't have a laptop! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He likes to spend quite time with himself and delve into the depths of his thoughts and life in general and sometimes speaks in such a peculiar style, as if he was a philosopher!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I like his sketch jokes and would like him to continue with it. They're roughly made but convey the message in quite a subtle way.<br>What I would like to take from him is love for one's home place.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Nauty</b> floormate for 2 years in GHEB. This guy from the lovely duns is also an equally beautiful person.

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yogesh bhai, Naughty! <br><br>From now onwards, NA would stand for Naughty Airwana <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>I knew this guy from the days of my freshers. A very calm and composed dude. A very good singer too. Writes awesome poetry. Always lends a helpful hand. That's all I knew about him in the first year.<br><br>During our Kerala trip I came to know that he's not just a good singer, he also sings from the bottom of his heart with all emotions and one can feel his emotions from his voice. The songs he choses to sing are very senti ones. <br><br>In third year, we both took part in Interhouse Collage competition and I came to know that he;s an exceptionally creative guy. Well, the judges were not able to see our creativity <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But that doesn;t prove anything. All I can tell you is that it was the Best. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to your talent brother.<br><br>And today, he no more seems to be a guy from Dehradun. He looks like a stud. He's built an awesome body, bole to ekdum hero ke maafik. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and with his cool attitude and hot looks he's trying to impress everyone. Koi na koi to mil hi jayegi banglore me ... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Don't worries <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Well, the most memorable moment with this guy would be the time when we were travelling from Periyar to Cochin and singing the song "Pal bhar ke liye ..." in the bus. The cool breeze and the awesome weather made the song come alive. And I could feel the emotions with which he was singing. It was awesome. Simply Awesome. We rock dude. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future buddy, keep rocking in Airwana.

<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nautiyal aka nauty aka nuts <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ...<br>As I remember I met first time him in NBH mess.... aata tha ...or chupchap breakfast karke chala jata tha. I came in touch with him, regarding CBSE scholarship for top 500 of AIEEE. But unfortunately dono ka kat gaya <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . Then we became BTP partners, and then we became good friends. Fir outings , coffeshop ke chakkar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, alok ke room me BC start ho gayi. He is really a hard working guy, believes in himself. Sometimes he lacks confidence, when the matter is serious. <br>As time passed, most of us has changed , fell into groupism , but due to his calm nature he started feeling uncomfortable in this environment, so he is waiting ..ki kab B.tech. khtm ho .. or kab ek nayi life start karu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .It's good that you haven't change.  Then time came for placements. I think he was one of the very first person, started  prepration for placements. Ise dekh kar he hum logo ne 1-2 mahine pehle prepration start kar di. And I am really thankful to him for that. He loves his past, his hometown ( Gadhwal <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) , his family, his culture. Sometimes he is very emotional and sentimental, that we have to take care when we are in groups. Also he loves scatching , blogging n movies. <br><br>Some memorable moments/Things with u - <br><br>BTP <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Goa Trip ( I missed that incident when i went to disk <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br>Placements <br>New year 2008 celebration <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Coffe shop <br>Combine study<br><br><br>I wish one day u'll make proud ur parents on u ( as u have done till now ) and fulfill all ur dreams.

<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nautiyal becomes Nauty. Conventional to Contemporary.<br><br>I came in contact with him in my second year when mathur used to be his room-partner. It took me lot of time to understand this soul as he always enjoyed his privacy. He had some priorities with which he had come to college. One among those priorities was to make his parents proud of him. With time our bonding grew stronger. Later when we had shifted to OBH, fortunately nauty got a room adjacent to me. It was time for placements and alok, paro, atul, nauty and me prepared hard for placements and hoped that we all get in one company someday. Lekin paro and atul 7.5 lakh ka haath maar gaye <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and rest of us had to satisfy ourselves with lower packages. But it was again fortunate that both of them are posted in Hyderabad. After placements I got to visit his town close to Dehradun. He is from a simple and educated family. There he told me about his struggle days when he used to daily up down one and half hours to dehradun for IIT coaching. Later he dropped the idea of going for coaching and prepared on his own and finally landed here in IIIT securing 346 AIR.<br><br>One thing for which I have always teased him is that he doesn't know how to ride a bike. These days he is taking lessons from me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bhai jaldi se seekhle warna usko kaise ghumayega <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... some of the yaadgar tips we had together are of kerala and UK (utrakhand).<br><br>Best wishes for your life after college.. and yes take a bigger flat.. we will come in dozens on weekends to blr and stay there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
