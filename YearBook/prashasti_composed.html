But in the end also he didn say anything.<img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>Well he has changed over the years.<br><br>I loved to call him uncle and link him with every girl I found him walking with.I knew there is nothing going on but I loved teasing him.<br>We had a lot of common things like we both are good at taunting <img src=Smileys/10.gif />,we often had common opinions on things. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> we back out when it comes to relationships..<br>    One thing he is good at is predicting about other people's life..And he is at times gr8 at it.

But he is so different when it comes to friends...atleast I know about me.When he is with you he is just your friend then.<br> The day he brought his bike to the campus was one of my <i>luckiest</i>. I love riding with him and when he crosses 80 kmph speed, its thrilling. I m so in love with the bike rides, then whenever I am in bad mood it is just an ice cream and a bike ride which cheers me. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

I saw a nice example of his strong determination before placements, when he used to study day and night and he was so damn confident in the end.The biggest worry I had before placements was what if one of us gets placed earlier?<br>But God is gr8 we both got placed on the same day...one of my happiest moment in IIIT.<br> <br>It was 2nd day of placement, I got shortlisted for Amazon and he wasn't. I was more tensed for him then myself.<br>After 2 tiring interviews when I heard he got shortlisted for Adobe I knew he will do gr8 in interview <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and he did.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>After every interview he faced, he was more happy and confident.He has given one of the best interviews in our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif />and I am so proud of him.<br><br>He is a complete package, he is mature ,strong ,sensitive, witty, sporty and a lovable person.<br>He has influenced me a lot by his thoughts.The change I observe in myself today is a lot coz of him.<br>He is one of closest friend I ever had.He is a great guy and I have spent so much time with him that I think I can write an entire book on him.<br><br>May you be always happy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best buddy.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is a petu, khabbad,bhukhad...(to infinity). When it comes to food he is a kid...or call him Joey..he never ever shares his food.<img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>When he is eating he has no friends and no compromises.<br>If you take a bite from his food, he will have to have another one, for his satisfaction <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I remember the pillion<br>fights we had over food(when I take a spoon or a bite from his food for tasting <img src=Smileys/3.gif />).  <br>And he eats so slowly and so much <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> that at times you get bored watching him eat and eat.<br>He overeats all the time and has set many records like 32 roties in a meal in yuktahaar.<br>If it is not a buffet he always has the maximum bill <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and then complains how less others eat.<br>I used to be surprised how a person can eat an entire cheese burst after eating 20 puris in the mess.<br>But now I guess I know that if tomorrow he sets a Guiness book record for eating <img src=Smileys/77.gif />I wont be surprised.<br>Have you ever seen a person eating an entire box of sweets in one go? If not you must watch him eating sweets.<br>Every week he will buy himself a box of sweets and will eat them all by himself <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is different, one of the most confident guys I have ever met.Even when he knows he had screwed badly he never panics.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>One of the very few people who means when he says "I don't give a damn to people".<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>He is damn secure, he knows he is good and never listens to anybody.<br>One of his unique characteristics is that when you are becoming friends with him he will first tell how evil he is so that if you want to back out , do it then.<br>He can be manipulative ,persuasive and evil also at times.<i>He believes in 10 eye for an eye.</i><br>But when it comes to stand by a friend he is always there.<br><br>It may sound weird but he is sweet at times too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But it is a rare occasion <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and he hates to be called sweet(guy problem <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>Well when it comes to acads, he never pays attention in class(well he comes to class rarely),he will study at the last moment and will get all these logical doubts and irritates the one who is trying to teach him. <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.<br>cont.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met this guy in my first class in IIIT, I didn't like him at all;typical Delhi attitude.He seemed arrogant and stubborn.Guess my initial judgment is never correct.He is a wonderful person.<br>Though he was quite different from the friends I had earlier but he was was fun to be with. <br>I always wanted a cool group(the one they had in hip hip hurray -1 )in fact I had one with Chand, Shikha and him. And it was fun.We used to walk in campus everyday, sit on the stairs opposite to <br>library and then talk about our school life. He was not much of a talker but his stories <br>were awesome. The way he tells a story is very captivating.I bet I have heard all his childhood stories more the 50 times. His stories were generally about food and fights <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>By the end of first sem we were great pals . I remember when we parted during winter vacations,I so didn't want to go home. Second sem was the period when we had infinite walks almost daily.<br>I didn know how we managed 2nd sem academically.. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>I remember we all had gone for RDB and were so happy and excited after the interval<br>but he said - "U all will cry when the movie ends" and yeah we were all silent like hell after the movie.<br><br>Then came felicity 06, and <b>Ankita Khanna incident</b> happened.Everyone was shouting ,atmosphere was tensed and I was afraid, but he stood by me all night.That instant I realized that this friend will be always there for me.<br><br>We had had ups and downs in our friendship but I am proud that we survived and here we stand<br>still together.He is one of my best friends and there is nothing I cannot share with him.<br><br>Talking of him, he is big time movie jockey.He never runs out of things to watch.He watches every movie n times.If given an option to eat and watch movie only all his life I think he will be happy.<br>For he was the one coz of whom I started watching Hollywood movies.He has an entirely different view of watching a movie .His view is similar to the way a director would think.In future if he ever gets a chance to direct a movie, he will </b></i></ul><br><br>
