<br>
<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul is the only "Always Hyper" Character I have ever met. Atul is really smart which can been seen by the fact that he has coped up with Daddu as project partners. Atul is easily irritated and used to be a victim of Scientists and My PJs. I had only few conversations with Atul before he came to IIIrd floor before that I had an impression that he is cunning (I believe all strangers will think so) but when I had conversations with him in IIIrd floor, All my opinions had shattered and I came to know that He is a really good guy with a huge sense of humour [ he cracks amazing witty jokes at times]. <br><br>This guy has a huge list of abuse words which he uses more often than anybody else. All his talent is evident in the fact that He being from a small village "Rewa" has made huge achievements in IIIT ... He was a significant member of IIIT Rock Band [He was the lead singer] and coined the name "Avant Garde" for it, He is an excellent Blind SHooter in BB, is xtremely good at studies ... hardly studies but he gets a A-,B,A for sure, shares my interest in uncleanliness <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, has a startup called Pacare along with Abhinav Parashar and thats only a few of his achievements.<br><br>Atul ... You are one of a Kind and I dont expect I will meet anyone like you in the future so will miss you. I m sorry for having called u You-Know-What.<br><br>Being fellow hyderabadis, signing off .... Kiran Danduprolu. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitingupta.html>Nitin Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nitin Gupta is a really cool, good, reliable friend to have. He has been my neighbour for the first 2 years and in these 2 years we had loads of fun especially during the time when i was the only one with a PC. We have been very good friends right from the beginning and during no time had we had a fight among us. He is really good with whatever he does and has an interest in web technologies, web design and sports.<br><br>Speaking of him, I remember an incident from 3rd semester when I was horribly sick and I hadnt had anything to eat for the whole day, Nitin came to my door and asked me if I would like to have an burger from the canteen. I couldnt resist the offer on any day whether I was sick or not. Thats Nitin for you ... and hence he is considered to be helpful by all.<br><br>His skills in dancing is umatched because of the energy he carries in his dances. You can see him dancing when he plays volleyball too <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is almost good at all sports that he plays be it cricket, volleyball, or BasketBall [ He was in the college BB team and he had no experience whatsoever before coming to IIIT]. He is considered to be the king of Aim_Headshot in CS that shows how accurate he can be when it comes to aiming at the head.<br><br>Wishing you all the best for ur future ... keep in touch ... signing off .... Kiran Danduprolu</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part 2 of 2]<br><br>It is due to him that I had my only Paintball experience in Felicity during our 2nd year. [It was one moment I will cherish because it was unique]. His coolness can be seen in his dance which he did right before Venkaiah sir after he was assured that he will be given a average-to-minimum grade.<br><br>This guy was quite depressed by the fact that I was the only one who hasnt been placed yet and adviced me to do different things and ask help if necessary. All his good wishes and also others have come true when I got placed in DELL. He is quite helpful and is ready to help when needed. His talent is BB is also worth talking because he is by far the best shooter I have seen in IIIT.<br><br>And now that you are staying with Rahul I believe we will be in touch and Plz be careful of Rahul as he has learnt the art of Instantaneous Black Magic <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He will make sure that CITRIX wont cheat you so you have nothing to worry about financially. Wishing u all the best @ CITRIX and Bangalore ... Signing off ... Kiran Danduprolu. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part 1 of 2]<br>Sachin Goyal is one heck of a cool guy u'll ever see. I met him through kapil and Sambhav in NBH Cellar and soon we got along without any problem and I really admire his kind of life. He enjoys his life to the fullest without going down on other things. [Which can be best seen in the fact that he was placed far earlier than others in CITRIX].<br><br>He watches so many movies that even a movie addict like me should bow down to the master <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I love irritating this guy in dumb-c by giving the weirdest movie names to his teammates while enacting. His love for old classics made him a very famous downloader in 2nd Yr [Everyone knew Icsahn the downloader at that time in DC]. His movie reviews are quite good and very accurate.<br><br>He enjoys having fun to the core and is always ready for any kind of BC/fun/sport/Gaming Activity. An excellent AOE and CS player he is and I m afraid of him in both games[this is a secret] [Please do show "Mercy" on me in these games].  <br><br>He is also a gr8 singer with a vast knowledge of Hindi songs and hence has won Antakshiri events many times in these 4 years. Of late he has been interested in Telugu songs too [appudo ippudo from Bomarillu is his favorite <img src=Smileys/10.gif />].</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part 3 of 3]<br><br>Dont worry we can continue our gaming spree on weekends on XBox Live or I would come over to your house for the same. Now that you are in Microsoft I bet you could get game titles for much cheaper price than in Market. Hoping to try out WWE, Tekken, Street Fighter, DC vs Mortal Kombat, Gears of War, and other co-op and multiplayer game with you in future.<br>	I really appreciate and thank you for your offer on sharing a house with you. All the best for you future @ Microsoft and I know we will be in contact for years to come.<br><br>Signing off ... Kiran Danduprolu</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part 2 of 3]<br><br>Timeline of Games we have played together:<br>1)AOE --- 2nd year along with Sachin, Somani, Kulbir and others<br>2)CS --- 2nd,3rd and 4th year along with Many batchmates<br>3)Marvel Trading Card Game --- 3rd Year --- One of the most awesome gaming experiences that I have ever had -- there was nothing much to do but The strategies, teams, decks .... ah I miss this game a lot.<br>4)Civilization IV --- 3rd Year --- I knew this was the best Strategy game ever and Ojasvi gave it a shot and guess what he agreed with me and he was addicted to it too. Then we started playing this in multiplayer mode too against Computer. It was also fun as I used to concentrate on development while Ojasvi showed his commandereal skills in trying to attack the Comp.<br>5)Titan Quest --- The Diablo Style game which I initially disliked caught Ojasvis interest and he asked me if I would play it with him and I agreed with very small hope but multiplayer in Titan Quest made my opinion change on the game and we completed the game together in multiplayer mode.<br>6)Diablo II --- Completed Diablo II in multiplayer mode along with him in 4th year almost 1 week back <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>7)World of Warcraft --- I was a WOW addict back in 3rd year and asked Ojasvi to join as it was a MMORPG and it was the only opportunity in college we would get to try MMORPG. Ojasvi too liked the game but was quick to realise that it was damn addictive and tried to avoid the game and only played it when I was with him.<br>8)Warcraft III Dota<br>and many more small games including pocket tanks.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ojasvi is one of the most special friends I have ever had. I dont remember when we first met in IIIT and how ever friendship began but I really thank God for having sent Ojasvi to IIIT with me. Whenever I and Ojasvi come together other friends start running away as they know we will talk about Games,Games and Games and there will be no scope for BC around. Ojasvi is dedicated and feels responsible and hence manages his time to have a balance between gaming, tv shows, studies etc. He does all his work on weekdays and does full Gaming on weekends. Ojasvi is one of the few lucky ones who has been placed in Microsoft this year and I bet he will climb the ladders there much quicker than others do.<br>	I and He have together played numerous PC games multiplayer on LAN ... I bet none would have even heard of these games. We share common gaming interests and thats why we get along so quickly in multiplayer.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitin.html>Nitin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nitin Bansal is a really cool person to hang out with. He was my neighbour during 1st and 2nd year and we were good friends right from the beginning when Kharkwal introduced him to me. He is damn intelligent, lazy, talkative and is a very sound sleeper. He used to sleep like anything when he studied Maths for the exams.<br>     We used to play loads of FIFA matches together in 2nd year ..[ almost 2-3 hours daily for 2-3 Weeks] and I remember his Gaming Style by the "Malouda Kick" that he hit once .... it was a blinder and I was simply awestruck and was speechless at it. He and Kharkwal used to pull my leg at times during the first 2 years.<br>	I remember an instance where I had a class at 2PM and both Nitins were in my room at around 1:45PM ... we were playing Cricket on my PC [at that time only I had a PC in my room]. I had to goto class and I told Nitin that the only way he could continue using my PC was that I lock my room from the outside and goto class. Nitin agreed and I had locked him up for 1 1/2 hr with my PC. [SOrry for doing that It was a very immature action of mine].<br>	He is good at all Sports but the only thing he doesnt prefer to do is move so as long as He doesnt need to move he is an excellent player. His bowling in cricket is exceptional and has the knack of picking up wickets with ease [I still remember one of your balls to which i was clean bowled to].<br>	Now that you will be hyderabad expect you to be in touch with me. <br><br>Signing off ... Kiran Danduprolu.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part 2 of 3]<br><br>3)The Scary Part:<br>	Abhishek ... Scary ............. Never. But Abhishek is scared of the dark, ghosts, zombies and all dark evil forces. Once he rang me up at 1:15 AM and asked me to come to Abhinavs room. I went and then he asked me to accompany him to his room (reason: He just watched some scary scenes of The Ring or Grudge) and abhinavs room was just one wing away. That clearly shows how scared he is.<br>	Message for you: Watch Horror Movies that is the best way to get rid of fear of darkness. [I follow this]<br><br>4)Work ... Work ... Work:<br>	Apart from Movies/TvSHows the only thing Abhishek does is work or spend time fearing that he might not complete his work. A Java geek he is and does most of his work in Java which in turn is quite cumbersome as it creates loads of files. [ He once had 20,000 files in 2 GB and it took me about 25 minutes to copy all those files as a backup]. <br><br>5)Creativity:<br>	Abhishek is no doubt the most creative person <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I have seen in IIIT. This guys imagination goes beyond limits and hence people call him the Scientist but it is when people go beyond limits that new Inventions and Innovations begin to happen. I m pretty confident that his creativity will help him publish a research paper which will blow people's mind. <br>	He has wonderful Ideas on concepts of Superheroes, Scifi stories and fictional characters. He treasures all these Ideas in his laptop and does it regularly. He also saves quotations of others, his own in another document which he often uses as his status message.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part 1 of 3]<br><br>Abhishek Sainani is one of the most special person I have ever seen. He became a very close friend of mine when he shifted to a room right opposite to mine. He is glued to his laptop just like me but he spends his time in different activities like chatting, social networking, programming, reading which I dont prefer.<br><br>Few points worth mentioning about Abhishek:<br>1)TV Shows/Movies:<br>	He is one of the very few who shares my movie interests and we generally like a movie alike. He has interest in various genres but doesnt like horror movies and avoids them altogether. Abhishek is able to watch all these movies in his "matrix effected" Laptop Screen.<br>	Best Movie he recommended me: Man from the Earth<br><br>	And Coming to TV Shows, On his suggestion I started watching my First TV Show "Heroes" and It was amazing to watch 1 1/2 seasons without any break. Then onwards we had huge discussions on Heroes which made Kharkwal and Rahul frustrated and guess what we used to make many correct guesses and used to predict to some extent. Abhishek watches many other TV Shows which I dont watch, he has the same interest in all shows and watches them with deep dedication.<br>	Best Show Suggested: Heroes<br><br>2)The Funny Side:<br>	Abhishek is a really funny guy ... people accuse him of PJs which at times he tells. Abhishek and Atul are one of the most funniest duos I have ever seen ... each time they come together, it is a treat for people who are watching that scene. Whenever I wanted to have some fun I used to visit his room and started irritating him ... thats when he becomes the funniest.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Movie and Music freak:<br>	Kharkwal is a music freak to the core ... has a collection of english songs well over any other personal collection of music by anyone in our batch. He has a huge knowledge of music.Once he gets addicted to one track you can listen to that music playing in his laptop till he finds some other addictive track.<br>	He has a real weird taste for Movies ... I guess all recommendation systems would fail on this guy (that includes the Legendary 'Muglu's system'). He may sometimes like the worst possible movie and sometimes hate one of the best movies of a specific genre. He is one of the very few in our batch who doesnt watch a English TV Show in college.<br><br>Passion for Games:<br>	Kharkwal is the only true gamer besides me in our batch. We read on latest news on games to come in the future ... the previews, hands on etc. A true Fifa fan (has all versions of FIFA with him) and God knows how many times he has completed Prince of Persia (all 3 3D Version of the game).<br><br>And now that you are heading to New Jersey for a PhD Psychology in Rutgers University try to stay in touch online [I will always be online as usual]. Wishing u all the best for ur future studies and future itself as a whole .... signing off ... Kiran D.<br><br>I may write another testi but all depends on time.  <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is the first batchmate that I had met in IIIT and he was alloted a room right next to mine. We were friends right from first year, we had fought a few times but we remained very good friends throughout these 4 years.<br><br>A few things worth mentioning about him are:<br>Excellence at Acad work:<br>	I need not tell much about it but what people dont know is how fast he does all the background work needed for an assignment, project, presentation, exams. He is capable of reading a specific topic to a very deep level within 1 day without even getting frustrated. He also has good knowledge of medicine and biology which happens to be his second choice after computers.<br><br>	We all know he does his work but you should see his coding skills ... he can make quality code in no time. <br><br>Food Junkie:<br>	The only true non-veg fan in my friend circle and hence we share food on most occasions. He has an appettite for good quality food and hence never backs down when comes to the cost. I and Kharkwal may well be the people who have gone out maximum number of times for having food outside IIIT (The only competition might be Ankit Saraswat <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br>	It is with him that I went to Barista, CCD, and Subway for the first time.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br>(Continued)<br>- Rumors has it that offlate he has become a chick magnet<br>- We made rapidshare accounts together after uploading and sharing you-know-what.<br><br>(Will write more if I remember more points.)<br>Take Care and All the best for your future and do keep in touch.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deepak Vig can be best put as the silent assassin ... remains silent most of the time but excels at whatever he does and makes the best of his time. Our friendship flourished during the IT workshop III project in which we used to think of various ways of getting the work done using minimal effort but that was the start of the Deepak era from which he kept on learning different technologies. I and he made a very simple php script as our project initially but later on He himself completed the project even though I,Kapil,Dharmeet where his teammates. This era is still in progress and by now he has learned various technologies ranging from flash, C#, Java, SymbianOS, PHP, AJAX, CSS, Javascript, Flex and so on. <br><br>The Masterminds Game:<br>	In 3rd semester, I and He played the biggest trick both in terms of time and katvaana of which the victims are unaware till date. Though we have forgot that this event has happened we share funny moments when we recall of how we fooled most of our friends.<br><br>The Sportsmen Vigla:<br>	Deepak is a star player in cricket capable of sweeping the fastest bowlers in IIIT onto the legside field <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif />. He is also an excellent athlete (secret lies in yuktahaar food maybe). He has excellent volleyball skills and returns the ball to the other side very accurately and consistently.<br><br>Road to Eldorado:<br>	I was never an event organizer and once I receive this message from Vig : "Do u want to help organize this event in sunday carnival?" and I was like :"WTF!!!". Most of the time I sit Idle so I replied "Yes". Me,Deepak and Srirang were supposed to organize this oncampus treasure hunt. Deepak and Srirang made the puzzles while I framed the questions in the computer. The walk that day we had in IIIT trying to find out the weirdest locations in IIIT is a moment to be remembered and not to be forgotten.<br><br>Other Points worth mentioning:<br>- We used to goto the Coffeeshop quite regularly together in 3rd and 4th semester sharing funny moments of how our mastermind game was going on.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;<br>     [Part-3]<br>Movies:<br>He has loads of conditions for movies. Here is few of them with respective genres:<br><br>All:<br>- Happy Ending<br>- Heroes/Heroines shouldnt die<br>- No NC-17 content.<br><br>Romance/Comedy || Comedy || Romance:<br>- Preferably Girl dominated movies.<br>- No serious villians.<br><br>Horror:<br>- Ghost is a must. [ He hates "The others" and hates me too for suggesting it to him.]<br>- Story and Logic is not important.<br>- It should be damn scary.<br><br>He rarely watches Thriller, Action, Scifi stuff but if he is watching it with interest then there is more to it then what we think it is. He also watches telugu movies even if I advice him to stop watching them and make use of time more optimally.[btw he is a Brahmanandam fan]<br><br>Trivia:<br>Did you know that half of his hard disk space ie 20 GB is consumed by You-Know-What. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Hoping that we remain very good friends for a long time ... I end this testimonial.All the best for you future and DO keep in touch bcoz I have a tendency not to.<br><br>Note: This happens to be my first testimonial for a friend and I m not proofreading it so there might be mistakes at some places which are best ignored.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part-2]<br>Health/Hygiene/Fitness:<br>Rahuls room is an epitome of cleanliness. He gets his room cleaned almost twice a week while I do it once in 2 months even after being his neighbour. I remember how he used to scold Atul for keeping his room as bad as possible. He used to complain about my room too but he got used to it.<br>	He is very selective about food and prefers his food to be ultra hygiene. He definitely is the person with least number of visits to the canteen during these 4 years while I must have been the paid highest number of visits to the canteen.<br>	As far as fitness is concerned, He has been a consistent jogger since 2nd year and easily cover long distances which I wouldnt dare to dream about too. He hasnt played much sports in college but definitely has a thing for badminton.<br><br>Chicks and Clicks:<br>Rahul is the human chickipedia of the our batch. You can find Rahul in all social networking sites ... he joins them just for the sake of finding an awesome girlfriend but to his vain ... all his requests get rejected (dont give up dude .... u will be successful on some occasion <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Apart from this, he has a thing of cute actresses and loves to watch their movies (btw he is a very big fan of lindsay or was). He has a huge list of cute girls from various fields ... be it sports, foreign movies and what not.<br>	He likes being clicked on cameras/mobiles. You can see him run for the sake of being photographed and is very proud of his "Genuine Smile"(TM). Sometimes he has been shot in some controversial poses of which few people would know about and I am sure the rest will come to know soon.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;<br>		[Part - 1]<br><br>I wasnt familier with Rahul during my 1st year ,I only had the idea that he was dedicated towards Studies and was pretty good at it. It was during my Second year that I became friends with him which then flourished in 3rd year when Rahul shifted his room to NBH 3rd floor on advice of Kharkwal. Now we are neighbours and very good friends. <br><br>Here are a few points worth mentioning about Rahul:<br><br>Studies:<br>Raol definitely is one of the most disciplined students I have ever seen. He has a thing of acad work and keeps doing all of them in time. He has a tendency to listen in almost all classes and which is really rare in our batch. There are times when he becomes a bit careless and causes humour in the class itself (remember puck-puck incident in CL-1). Sometimes he feels depressed that even after working so hard he doesnt manage to get a GPA above that of people who havent worked hard for it but now he has gone over it and no more compares himself with others.<br><br>Hisaab/Loan/MoneySpending:<br>He is one of those people who checks out all available options and tries to get maximum from the money he spends without going down in terms of quality. He has an interest for expensive, stylish, and branded accessories and clothing.<br>	He does the hisaab whenever I, Kharkwal, and he go out for dinner. I and kharkwal dont bother to check the bills and his hisaab because he calculates them with accuracy until 2 decimal digits which he rounds off later in an unconventional way which he only knows. When he does hisaab in his mind, he does mistakes so we always to do the hisaab in his room with a free mind.<br>	Being in debt of him would be the last thing u would ever want to do. As long as u r in debt of him ... u will have dark days which many people say is because of Rahul's Black Magic ability (Do teach me a few tricks in summer <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>Health/Hygiene/Fitness:<br>Rahuls room is an epitome of cleanliness. He gets his room cleaned almost twice a week while I do it once in 2 months even after being his neighbour. I remem</b></i></ul><br><br>
