<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first thing I remember about him is his marks in mathematics in AIEEE were something above 200, which is huge!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>We had some real fun time in workspace when he used to use Nauty's PC in workspace since Nauty was the sole owner of his PC. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I liked his reaction to whatever I said and sometimes he also grabbed my neck for cracking PJ <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Soni - a bindaas guy and a bond mathematician. Came to know about him first when someone told me that a guy had 200+ score in AIEEE maths section and I was all praise for this guy even without meeting him. Got to know more about him when we did the trading domain project in ltrc in summer'07. Was really fun working with this brainy chap and the manner in which we extended a two week project to a two month long one was pretty awesome <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Always has a cute smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> which is good to see. Had a tough time during placements when he was really unlucky to not get placed for almost a week despite clearing every written test, but he never let the spirit die which is indeed commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your future buddy. You will really make it big some day. <br><br>God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>We were neighbours in the first year. This guy used to have a smile for most of the time. Other times, he would be complaining about something or the other <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  I remember he had got some 200+ marks in AIEEE Maths and was particular good at Maths. <br><br>We had a lot of interaction durin Placements - He somehow got this stupid feeling that I had a role to play in his not getting through Microsoft. Why would I? <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> I am not sure whether he still thinks so. He anticipated that he was gonna get thru both MS and DEShaw but as destiny would have it, he had to wait for almost a week to get placed. Hard times, those were for all of us.  In his words, he got sick of having to see my face daily <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All the best!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I know him right from first year as we were both in same section. While I was new to colg I was kind of reserved and quiet, then one day in morn session of PT I met this guy while playing Volleyball. I was new to the game and was playing in his side. I missed many shots..then I saw this guy with so much confidence and he started blabbering with me...infact he was commanding everyone on the field though he din knew anyone thr.That misconception of arrogance disappeared when we talked. I realised how friendly and honest is this person. Much of the time in the two years I had spent with him.Chatting for hrs, roaming around, sharing or lil secrets of school life...I still rem when he opened his heart to me. Besides we began to study together and doing assignments.<br>I have my mobile handset which I bought on his advice...Sony Ericsson on Soni's advice. Yaar this mobile will alwayz keep reminding me f u...till I buy a new handset <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . And yeah It will obviously be sony ericsson again.<br>He has given me a unique nick name...can't write here...*bhai wo naam bhi yaad rahega* .<br>I praise him for his self-beleif, confidence. This guy has  a damn +ve attitude..If-someone-can-do-it-so-can-I. Very good at academics as his record says...Bond in Maths.<br>A great fan of Madhavan and SRK. His wearing spects has a history hidden behind them. Sorry to reveal that here. This person was so fanatic fan of SRK in childhood, he donned wearing glasses deliberately inspired by SRK style (perhaps from Bazigar). Thats how he weakened his eye sight..and now dons those glasses for a permanent style..btw they look cool on you. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Offered many times to visit his home...but somehow I missed the opportunity. But will rem that night when he took me and Bajaj to a club night event of whom his father was a member. We had delicious dinner there and met his cool and very friendly Pa.He danced with his Pa on DJ that night. Me and Bajaj were just looking around.yaar u are one of the closest friend I made in IIIT. stay in touch. *Friends Forever*<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Sunil Soni aka Soni aka Sohni</u><br><br>The perfect combo of Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, he is one of the fellows who is equally at ease with people fom Andhra as well as from North. Will always remember him for the smile which is always falshing on his face. One of the very few people whom you will always see with a smile on their face. A mastkhor, you will always have a great time when you are with him. He was one of the initial friends I made in IIIT, courtesy Prithvi House performance we did in our 1st year Freshers, I still remember the <b>Das Bahane</b> dance group he was a part of. <br><br>He has always been a guy who you can trust with anything, I still remember the dedication with which he prepared the our juniors for the dance on their freshers night. He would be sitting in the lobby of 1st floor with his laptop and making the juniors dance until they did it correct. <br><br>Again one of the people <b>"satofied"</b> by me, whenever I meet him, i would slap his back, anybody can imagine how he must feel when I slapped this lean thin guy. A brilliant sportsperson and a brilliant student. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future man.. Keep in touch!! <br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My favourite memories with Soni have been during Felicity '08. As a sponsorships guy, he was eager, but needed some pushing. But after some time, when we got into the mode, he did a very good job <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I still remember that long day, when HVB, you and me sat in the lab to make the list of groups and company allocation. <br><br>The best thing about Soni is the smile he greets you with. Its a short smile, but its unmistakable. Come to think of it, I've never seen him have skirmishes with anyone. Cheers to him for that!<br><br>Soni changed from a just-another-guy to a fodu guy in the second year. His grades improved, his knowledge was good and he started fodufying big time! It was an amazing transformation, something which I did not expect. He was doing very well in mock CATs as well, except for the verbal section. I'm sure you'll bell the CAT once you get rid of your Achiles' heel.<br><br>After Felicity, he even landed up with an internship in one of the top companies. It was a little sad that deserving as he was, he did not get placed in the first 4-5 days. Himank, he and I were together in our bereavement, giving the most interviews without getting placed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .<br><br>Wish you all the best in life be, May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Felicity meetings<br>Message for him: Lambu, ladki patai ki nahi? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

I sometimes used to bug him when he came online!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>The outings with him mainly centered on the whole group ganging up on one of the bakra and teasing him/her. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We have had our share of talking some serious stuff too. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is a perfectly balanced person - can keep you happy with his jokes and also listen you out if you are serious. His behavior can also consist of being kiddish sometimes. Plays badminton quite nicely. <br><br>Hope you overcome your laziness someday... <br>It was fun spending time with you buddy!<br>Look out for some more online bugging sessions from me <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Good luck and keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>

He is probably one of those guys of our batch whose sgpa has never dipped below 8 in any of the eight semesters <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . Volleyball player also.<br><br>Wish you all the best you will surely crack CAT the next time. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Finally a testimonial for you. He has been a great friend of mine for all these years. How shall i describe him ? He is very helpful, friendly, intelligent, behaves childish at times, has a good sense of humour but struggles to understand telugu. Here is one encounter with him that i will never forget. <br><br>I took his bike and went for a ride. Came back to hostel and i was in a tensed, worried mood searching for the lost bike keys. Finally i told soni that i lost the keys. He replied simply "keys kakapothe bike pootundaa ". I was shocked on hearing his reply. <br><br>There are numerous exams for which we studied together, we also played together Volley ball for batch. I must mention that the efforts you have put during placement preperation are worth commending. I bet you will surely reach your goals if you continue the same efforts. All the best. <br><br>More to come <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>--<br>Abhilash I.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
