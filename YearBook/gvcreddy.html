<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Vinay aka Kala Bandar</u><br><br>Vinay apna Kala bandar sala, its always fun hanging out with this guy. Always been a happy go lucky type guy always ready to share a laugh with you. Didnt interact much with him over the first two years, but then our interaction increased when he came to OBH. I will always remember the booze these guys had at the end of our wing, the guy was hell bent on ounching each and everybody in sight, and he DOES punch hard. That day I remember I was making pegs for him but the dumbass would pick up a glass and drink neat vodka (and that was his first time afaik) and he wouldnt even agree to drinking water after that. I dunno what he is made of, he was normal even after having neat vodka for the first time (later on you get used to it, but the first time <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ). Since that time I started calling him <b>bewda</b> and whenerver I called him bewda he would reciprocate with the same <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, loser kahin ka.<br><br>I recently discovered  he hates it a lot when somebody calls him <b>Kala Bandar</b> and since then that is the only name with which I call him. A sweet person, recently he asked me if I minded the one time he teased me.. and I was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Dude I don't  even remember what you are talking about... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future and Try and be in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Most Memorable moment : Definietely that booze party <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b><br>Cheers!!

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 3 </b><br><br>There are many memorable moments for which I'd miss this guy (in future.. as of now we are placed in same company and most prolly will be sharing the flat too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) One of them would be the day we got placed. Couldn;t be more exciting than this. Also leofying Sharat together. And especially the Bhargava chettu thing in mess <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All those witty jokes in mess. Solving KK/Cache In in my room and eating pizzas. Playing business <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Swimming (btw.. he's the guy who taught me swimming in 10 days. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ). Drinking <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Going to Mock tests. Post Mock-test discussions. Arguments over his water bottle. And most importantly his smile. (VP chesesanu .. ippudu em peekutav peek ko kinda smile for which there are no replies). Himesh songs <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Equity pulse that we played in 2nd year. Well there are so many memories to cherish.<br><br>If I ever write a book on my BTech life, there would be a mention of this guys name on every page of it. That's how our friendship is. One special thing about our friendship is we never get angry at each other howmuch ever we pull each other's leg. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>I came very close to him when we were in 3rd year. He lived in the wing behind us. But our visit to his room was like a compulsory one at least once a day. Coz he shared many interests with us(sashi, sharat and me). He reads many books, loves solving sudoku(fuckin' fast at it), watches all the TV shows which we watch, plays small yet awesome online games, loves solving Hindu Crossword. And the most important thing, I've never seen anyone solve DI puzzles faster than this guy. Unfortunately, he screwed DI in CAT and I screwed quant which were like our fav subjs. Shit happens dude!! <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But one should've seen his face when he came to know that he screwed CAT. All smiles. Now thats some optimism. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Talking about vinay and not a single word about counters. Howz that possible. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> He is Counters king. He is the one in our batch who can counter "The great" Harsha. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. There's only one mantra in his life. "Spare no one, keep pulling everyone's leg". His creativity will come alive during the mess time. He looks like a very silent chap who is all busy doing his own work. But in reality, there's always something or the other creative going in his mind. He can be a real brain-fucker at times <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I didn't even know that there's a guy called vinay in my first year coz <b>A</b> He was so silent types <b>B</b> He was in B section. <b>C</b> He was in NBH. But come second year and he came adjacent to my room, became sashidhar's roomie and we had a ball.<br><br>I spoke to him first when we were doing OS assignments (He did all the work... I simply copied them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). It was then clear that this guy is an awesome coder. But that wasn't the real talent. The real talent came out on the day when we played Felicity Kode Konundrums in 3rd year. OMG! OMG! OMG! This guy must have brains faster than a computer. He's like the logic guru <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. In fourth year, when we were playing KK I came to know that for some question Somani wrote a code for 10 mins, which executed for 2 mins and still gave a wrong answer. Whereas, this guy simply looked at the question properly and told the answer in 1 min. Now that's some genious' work. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We used to play cricket in 2nd year summer. He always wanted to be wicket keeper and did a great job being a wicket keeper. That's how he earned his nick name "Gilly". Which is currently modified as "Gachibowli Gilly" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

In this state we can enjoy talking with him and you get some knowledge. The other state is laughing state. This state is reached when an item is given as input to him. It can be you or others. If it is others, you can laugh for sometime but if it is you then i needn't say. These two states changes with random probability infinitely. you never know in which state he is in immediately.<br>	Vinay, you are determined. nuvvu anukunte 10 pointer ayyevadivi kani anukovadam marchipoyav anukunta. "Short people are strong" saying is true in his case. Goes to gym regularly. We completed 10K race man. Thanks for your encouragement dude. Try to do that to everyone all the time.  You get some good ideas but y do you avoid to do them(like mails kottadam, blogs rayadam etc..). Think about it. learn the limit of teasing.<br><br>1st acquittance - we are in same group when we are showed campus.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met this guy only few months ago! We clicked because we had similar interests, desire for having Prince biryani or eating non-veg. A mathematics and puzzle freak and is truly a genius.Apart from that he can fk any1 when it comes teasing. <br><br>At times he is very annoying, whenever this guy is around you are either laughing your ass off or getting annoyed by the comments he passes on you ! <br><br>Note for him: Good luck with the window seat in Verizon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
