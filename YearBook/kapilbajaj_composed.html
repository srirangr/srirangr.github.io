Bahut chinta leta hai wen it comes to assignments and exams (meri tarah hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...)... he is very punctual too (is baat mein opposite hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )... will always complete all the assignments before time <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... or atleast know that there is one <img src=Smileys/4.gif />....<br>iske saath DDBMS ka project liya tha.. bahut pareshaan hua tha yeh ( aur main bhi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )...  because he wanted to do the project in one way and i wanted to do it in modules... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... but humane project pura kar hi diya tha aakhirkaar ( kam se kam prof. ko to impress kar hi diya tha...<img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br>Vaise dude tumhare kai doubts solve karte karte mujhe bhi help hui during placements... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> kuchh cheeze main dhang se samajh gaya tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...

<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Somani my X-room mate.... We met in train and the first thing which impressed me is his age... <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> he was abt 2 yrs younger than me... <img src=Smileys/13.gif />... Waise humane kabhi bhi jayada BC nahin ki because... yeh hamesha lab maine rahta tha aur mujhe lab ke naam se hi chid thi... but still I have noticed many things abt him... <br>Ek to inka determination... I don't think anybody knows this that the first day he came to college he studied DLD before sleeping that night.... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> So jo log sochte hai ki he is careless in studies unko bata doon ki banda bond hai aur koi na koi plan ke saath chalta hai <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />...<br>I have seen him 2-2 din ke baad room par ata tha....

<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My first impression of Paro was of extremely studious guy.... He scored very gud rank in AIEEE... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> then later I got to know abt him wen a girl gifted him a watch... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but during the first three years we just had hi hello and nothing more.... During the summer holidays wen he moved to cellar I got to know him better.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> First lemme tell u that Paro is the only guy in IIIT who was offered a Job in France I think.... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>It is always fun with Paro because of his peculiar styles... like he will always walk a step ahead or a step back of others <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ( Nobody knows why but I think it is better to mention that he Saarukhh of our college.... ) Likes to drink Coffee ( cuffee <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) a lot... he is the brand ambassador of Coffee Shop <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... U can come any time u will see him sipping cuffee in CS.... banda 50 ps. ki coffee peeta hai bhai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />... Aur haan b -> bh toh paro ka famous hai... bhai tabhi toh hum bhi koshish karte rahte hai bholne ki... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ki hum bhi uski tarah bhool sake <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ....<br>Banda ladkiyan patane maine (through chatting) bhi bahut hoshiyaar hai... pata nahin kitni girls se toh alukwa ki dosti karwa rakhi... Jab cellar maine uske room par jata tha.... tab jab dekho kisi ladki ki profile hi visit karta rahta hai orkut pe... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Ab baat aayi hai paro ki adaon ki toh inke photo session ka jikar to karna hi padhega.... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> kahin bhi camera click hone wala ho paro pahuchh jaate hai... aur pose bhi awesome awesome dete hai... hamare paas kayi saari beshkimti photu hai saarukhh kii <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ....<br>Banda padhai maine bhi phodu hai.. roz naye ideas aate rahte hai... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> har summers maine intern karke pata nahin kitne kamayen hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...<br>Waise he is one of the two guys in our college with two offers in hand <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I have no doubt tht u will be a big entrepreneur some day and giving jobs to students of colleges like IIIT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Chalo Paro CS chalte hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

First yr. maine deadline extend karani ho... ya phir lab maine kaam karna ho ( workspace wasn't enough <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> )... Daddu was the one trying to complete our demands even if his own assignment was not complete... <br>Mujhe yaad hai wen I went to Jaipur with him... iske saath agar tum traveling kar rahe ho then u <b>CANN'T</b> get bored...  waise us time ka ek incident maine likhna chahunga <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... To hua yeh hamare saath ek kanya baithi thi ( saath maine uski mummy  bhi thi...) aur hamare daddu ne unhe baithe baithe pata liya... jab tak woh log train maine rahe.. google microsoft se neeche hi nahin utre... yahan tak ki apne bhai to bangalore call bhi kar diya ek bet ke upar.... aur jaise hi woh log train se utre... bande ka first word tha Ch*****... toh aise hai hamare daddu... he knows wat to speak at the right moment <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... <br>inki ek aur acchi baat hai ki yeh kabhi gussa nahin hote ( ya phir gussa dikhate nahin hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )... but chahe kisi ne inke saath kitna bhi bura kiya ho he will not get angry aur hamesha cool rahenge... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> iski presentation dene ka ya phir coding karne (<i>Karwane <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> </i>) ka tareeka is also awesome...

[agar maine likhta rahunga to db. bhar jayega but batein khatam nahin hogi..])<br>Message: Sometimes being spontaneous is helpful then being prepared/calculated bec. people may take latter as manipulation. <br>finally, BOFA maine ho to roz milenge hi:</b></i></ul><br><br>

Jaise ki gupta ne likha hai auto waale ko manane ka kaam ho ya pizza ke offers ki baat karna bande ke baat karne ka tareeka bahut hi awesome hota hai...<img src=Smileys/1.gif />His transition from a <b>C</b>ool dude to a <b>H</b>ot dude takes only 5-10 seconds... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Isliye inse mazak karte hue bhi darr lagta hai... ki kahin gussa na ho jaye....<br>Placements ke time pe bhi I got to know his other side.... Banda is excellent in maths and all the stuff related to it.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> bhai maine aur guptha dekte hi rahe jaate they and he solved all the problems in a sec...

<b>For <a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I haven't seen this guy speak during the first year....  Then one day someone spoke something abt cricket in the mess and he started correcting him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...  well this is Mridul, a hardcore cricket fan who likes to read cricinfo and cricbuzz more than watching cricket <img src=Smileys/10.gif />... Well its true... I won't be surprised if he says one day that u can ask him anything abt any of India's matches <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... <br>He likes to go out too...  We had quite a few outings but the problem is that we are never ready for the same place to go <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> and as it turns out his opinion is contradicted by everyone <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> So if we all want to go to dominoes, he will want to go to pizza hut <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but in the end he will accept to go to the place chosen by us due to pressure... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Overall very nice guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and has opinion abt everything in the world... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>Well he is gud in studies too... I took english course with him... and he was extremely dedicated and gud in the subject.... He has worked extremely hard especially in the 8th sem and result can be seen by all...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He got a call from NYU and Johns Hopkins <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>He also has very high IQ and it is very hard to argue with him.... but I manage to do that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( sometimes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>All the best dude...  I hope u are able to get scholarship for these colleges <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Our first interaction was in MNIT Jaipur during counseling.... He was sitting there with his friend making fun of others <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and those who know him now will say that his nature hasn't changed much <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... He is one of the guys who are not even suited for CS department but he is in MS programme of IIIT ( I think u must be in finance department because of ur interest in share bazaar and financial sites <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ) but he has found a way to bring these two things together ( financial websites, I am sure that ur site will beat moneycontrol someday if u continue with it with the same enthu with which u started )... He is very gud in sports too... be it football or cricket ( is part of the college teams of both the games... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ) is even gud in basketball ( takes amazing three pointers <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> )....<br>He is known for his organizational skills also... I remember wen he organized a cricket competition ( was a huge success <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) on BB court in a Sunday carnival... Iski haalat dekhne wali thi... itna thaka hua tha raat ko kii isne Tinke ko bol diya manage karne ko...  Kitne naye aur interesting rules banaye they...  I think that was the starting point... jiske baad se naye naye competitions aaye hai in IIIT like IPL <img src=Smileys/1.gif />... <br>Now he is one of those guys who are called during every important meeting of our batch.... <br>He is the godfather of many of our junior students <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .... <br>Some names for u : Dulla, FKD...<br>A wish: Apni MS presentation par jaroor jaroor bulana <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>An observation: At some moments u lose ur cool for no apparent reason... </b></i></ul><br><br>

Right from first year I have seen working as an organizer in almost every event in IIIT ( I know because I am never involved in such things and notice all the others working <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )... Extremely dedicated to wat he does be it academics or events management <img src=Smileys/4.gif />...  he is always trying to give his 110 %...  even in this semester wen everybody else can be seen doing BC all the time... he remains in the lab all the time <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />....  He is a gud singer too ( and also likes to sing a lot, just ask him and he will sing for u <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....  back bone of Aakash house cultural team... He was also the lead of our placement committee and cud be seen running here and there ( on the call of Mr. Jaydev <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ).... but jokes apart he did a lot of work of there even wen he was unplaced... Even at that tremendous pressure he was so cool that shows his ability to handle such high pressure situations <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..... He is gud in sports too... I have seen him playing cricket, BB and volleyball and in all these games he plays with such enthusiasm... that it is pure joy to watch him play ( sometimes he creates some funny situations too specially in VB... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....  yeh kuchh chand logo maine se hai jiski taang bahut khichi jaati hai but he always has smile on his face and is very sporty <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....  Iske wajah se "sambhav wali" ke bhi kai baar maaze liye hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>I think u are perfect in every sense of the word... but I think u try too hard sometimes ( just me observation )...  <br>Wish u best of luck in future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Keep Rocking <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My first interaction with Karan happened when I was abt to give my english test for deciding the grps... he came to me and asked my name and home town (bec. some seniors has asked him to do so.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )... I was surprised by his confidence and way to talking and the best thing he is still the same... Later I found out that he is seated besides me... very attentive in class he used to ask a lot of doubts but also tried to take part in bc between Kapil n me....  He also in my discussion grp and there also was one of the most active member of the grp...  It helped me a lot as he used to talk a lot and me and some other guys were not bothered by the professor to talk.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... His enthusiasm in doing everything ( studies, games [cricket], organisation[felicity] ) is well known among the batch... and he has succeeded in allof these....  I have seen him playing cricket and volleyball and sometimes I worry that he will get injured because of the effort he put in the match <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....  Even during the CAT prep... he was the one abt whom everyone was sure that he will make it to A and he also did very well but due to unluck cudn't clear one topic.... but still he is selected for Indore <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...  <br>Best of luck for ur future... and one advice for u...

Your determination to excel in the field can be seen by the fact that once you haven't slept for 48 hrs just because you were stuck in a problem.... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>I'll always cherish the long but awesome bc sessions we had at CS in the evening <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> our newer sessions on the roof top of new building...  our walks after dinner...  your way of responding to every situation with a single word <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ....  your witty remarks and also how you will never admit ki tera kat gaya hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...  and of course your hutch connection which is one of the main reason I remain connected with the group <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>Finally, I know u wudn't change so there is no reason to give u any advice but I am sure that in the next five years I'll say to my friends that this was my idea which he heard from me at CS and is now earning money from it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Best of luck in rediff ( u can guess for wat <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Chalo baat karte hai Chaacha ki.....  Well first of all I wud like to advice anyone who reads this testi that if you haven't met him then don't make any impression on the basis of his structure.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> bec. that may be of harmful to you in the future.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...  now on a more serious note... in the first two years chaacha for me was a geeky guy who gives witty comments during classes and is a linux BOND....  may be he doesn't remember but I once sat in his room for around 2.5 hrs because I was getting fedora installed in my pc ( I did some mistake during installation so it took longer than expected... <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) in the first year, now at that time I didn't know him very well so may be he was getting bored with me so he went out of his room to Sachin's room and remained there for the entire time... Now this is a big thing for chaacha...  He was famous in our lab for a lot of installations, a title which was taken away from him by Dandu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But our real introduction happened when I came to cellar...  now lemme clarify a few things, chaacha is a very gentle person when he is talking to someone he doesn't know but as soon as you become acquainted you have to get used to a particular word which he likes a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...  I got to listen to that word a lot like everyone else.... So during those days it became our habit to go to NBH together for breakfast <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and we all went not just for food but also to see gud scenery. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We(a grp of around 4  people ) used to sit there gossiping and waiting for chaachi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( who didn't used to come there a lot <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> )....  Later we found that she eats in OBH first floor and chaacha is eating there since then <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />...  All those interesting lunch-dinner sessions with you(in yuktahar ) and then the roaming ritual were all too awesome...<br>[contd.]</b></i></ul><br><br>

During the first two years he for me was another chap from cellar....   But when I came to cellar in the summer holidays I got to know him better.....  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> First of all lets talk abt studies. I think he is the most dedicated banda of our batch when it comes to studies....<img src=Smileys/77.gif />  He may not have the CG to back this up or he may not be the best coder around but still no one from our batch will argue with me on this point. He would always make sure that he does all the assignments <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ( leave last sem <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) even when all the others are doing BC <b>in his room</b> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and then will give that assignment to everybody who will just make fun of him after taking the assignment ( arrey yaar I am getting to his gud nature which is so hard to ignore but lets stick to studies first <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )...  Haan toh in the last sem I realized that Alukwa and I have taken same courses in our Btech. But the course which showed his determination to me was DDBMS. He not only did all the assignments ( which was always for granted <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ), did the project of Daddu and Atal after doing his project <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .....   arrey yaar holidays maine bhi laga raha unke project karne maine.....  koi bhi kaam agar rahe jata hai toh our reaction is always <b> "Alok toh kar hi lega" </b> and the best thing is that he has never disappointed us. <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....

But during the third year we really got to know each other.... <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  We went out so many times...  specially to Siddiqui. A health freak he is always trying to improve his physique ( though he has an excellent one  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....  His determination could be found out by the fact that he was the one who used to wake around 10 guys for gym every morning at 5 30....  <br>He cud be seen at every sports event of iiit....  be it bb house matches or batch matches....   his enthusiasm in those matches wud always be very high no matter which team is wining as he wud always appreciate sports.... He also likes to go out a lot...  specially when there are new highly hyph-ed bollywood movies....  He is also a big fan of reality tv series Roadies and splitsvilla ( as he watches these shows after finding out who will be voted out <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> )  But still after doing all these things he always manages to find time for studying... I know that when we wakes up early to go for gym he always devotes around 1 hr for studying first <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Such combo is very rare to find who is gud in sports, studies and is still doing BC most of the time... He also likes to try new Hair cuts(Ghajini cut <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) and styles... and looks like he is ready to go for a party everytime <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...

<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I came to know Viglu better when we organized Cache-In together....  Earlier than that he, for me was a guy who knew everything to know abt web-scripting. During Cache-in I cud see how the cool the guy is ( may be because he had organized so many events that he had become habitual of that stuff... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) As said earlier he is one of the best website designers we have in our batch. I have seen him in classes when everybody wud be reading a novel and he wud be reading a "Complete reference to Java Script" <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> or something like that. The way he cud read such a boring stuff ( my opinion <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) shows his interest in the field <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ....  Later our friendship cemented when Ranjit wanted to come to Gheb so I moved into cellar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... There I came to know that he is more famous for his kitchen...  <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I cud see guys going to his room in the night and disturbing his sleep when they wanted something, never once he got irritated <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> .... But don't thing you can take advantage of his patience ( ask KaisaPaisa guys <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )....  A very moody guy in that respect he can devote himself completely for a task but can also leave it if he is not satisfied <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He also likes to travel a lot...  There are very few places left in India which he hasn't visited.....   His philosophy is very simple, to try everything at least once <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....  I had extreme fun with him during summer internships...  Specially when we went to one of our employees' house or when we used to dodge a call ( I hope u understand wat i mean <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) I cud never forget the long talks which we had when we used to come from Kothaguda to our college...  A very sporty guy, is ready for any adventure...   as long as you are offering something new <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He was also manager of our trip to Vaishno Devi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>In the final sem I spent a lot of time playing VB with him ( our team always won <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) or in CS but the real fun is in shouting "Viglu..Viglu.." <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Hope u find your Vigli soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.

He also introduced AOE to me and as you can ask anybody in our batch he is a master in computer games.....<br>So coming back to his nature....  he is very talkative <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( Aks do you remember the Algo classes in which we used to talk abt either AOE or House <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )....   doesn't want to remain in his room ( as he is always ready for Dominoes ( ask Maglu ) or for playing AOE ( ask Scientist ) ) <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  Don't think that he only plays computer games....   he is very studious too but he is a geek in the true sense of the word....<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He will never do anything which he finds boring or less interesting...   he will not even copy those assignments <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> but if he finds something interesting, he will not leave it <img src=Smileys/41.gif />...  I remember when we did Graphics project together and  I didn't have to do anything...  he wrote the complete code himself and with great efficiency <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Extremely interested in graphics he never tried to pursue that interest which I think he shd have <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> We have had long talks abt others when we were alone in GHEB....  so he knows a lot of things abt me <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br>Well I think the ideal job for you would be in making animated movies as you like coding as long as you can see the output <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> You are also ideal for MBA but the risk that if you don't find the job interesting you will leave it <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <br>A very respected guy ( I have never seen anybody making his fun except for me and Atul <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )....   but also extremely careless ( which is one of the things I hate <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> abt him)... </b></i></ul><br><br>

We could hear "Akash-Akash" from all the corners of the lab as soon as he entered the lab. He used to help all the students even though he still had to submit his own questions. His knowledge in C impressed me a lot as he used to solve our doubts in seconds while we used to ponder over it for hours.<img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I came to know him better during the Jeevan Vidya sessions.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We were both Made to sit together and we both were equally excited abt the idea of Jeevan Vidya. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> While for most of our batch mates JV was a torture, it turned out pretty gud for me mostly because of this guy.

Due to him most of the lectures were less boring, as we both couldn't sleep, so we used to talk all the time in the class. <br>He is also a huge fan of most of the sitcoms and TV serials that I also like so we can talk all day without getting bored. His knowledge in this area is secondary to none <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and I am just not saying this. You can compare whatever he says with a wiki   and that makes it all the more harder to argue with him <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> as he is always right. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>He is the one on whom you can count on whenever you need him. I remember when I was going home and I wanted someone to go and attend one of the lectures of ijcai conference for me (someone who would actually go through the torture of sitting during the complete lecture ), his name was the first one to pop in my head. <br>If you want any advice on something than you can always go to this guy as he will give the correct advice considering all perspectives. <br>I just want to thank you dude for being a good friend all these years and also best of luck for mba exams ahead. </b></i></ul><br><br>

He watches sitcoms all night long and still can attend all the lectures the next day. <br>He is one of the guys with whom I used to love playing CZ and age because of his innocent mistakes and queries <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We used to beg him to play Age with us.<br>Though he watches many sitcoms and movies but he is also very punctual when it comes to studying. He never misses a lecture or never forgets to do assignments even when others have decided not to do that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I have seen him reading in his room while Atul and Aniket used to practise songs in the same room. You cann't ask for a better roommate than scientist. <br>He is also a very good dancer and actor. You once told me that you want to write a movie story and win an oscar for it. I hope you keep trying for it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br>I hope that you will not change except for the fact that you must be a little for confident in yourself and then you can do wonders...<br>Best of Luck for your MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>You know that I never wrote a testi before, so I used to think what will I write for anyone but abt you cann't stop writing. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> In the end I just hope that you remain the same deterministic, over-enthusiastic, smart, witty guy from a lesser known place REWA and I seriously find myself lucky to be your friend. Hats off to you dude.

<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[contd. from previous one ] I don't think dude if you remember that once we were sitting in library and you were stuck in an assignment code and asked me to find out the problem and I scolded you for doing a very silly mistake. I said that you have to be serious otherwise you will not learn. (At that time we also created the famous rockingatul@gmail.com account <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) Later I copied all the ITWS assignments from U <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>I miss those days when I used to come to your room and listen to scientist and you fighting over nothing or when we used to prepare for mid sems <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ( ya dude I used to read in your room though u said that i read secretly in my room <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> ) After second year u went to NBH and then you became <b>DUDE</b>. You cud manage studies, singing, playing instruments, organizing events, making others participate in the event ( in IIIT this is the biggest thing to do ) all at the same time. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br>Well this is not it, let me talk a little abt basketball. You came with knowing nothing abt it and became the best shooter of our batch, player of batch team and house team and I don't want to confess this but you have beaten me by the score of 10/0 on more than one occasions. I know I have made fun of you on your playing skills (and will continue to do so <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) but I don't need to tell you that you have achieved so much in so little time that we cann't even imagine. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br>I seriously hope that you don't stop playing after college. <br>I am writing gud things abt you that doesn't mean you are perfect. There are various things for which you have to work, but on that we can work on later <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But even after doing so much and becoming DUDE, you still have some qualities which remind of the time when we first met, pls. don't change those qualities <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul and I met first when we were called for interaction by various seniors. We used to talk about all the incidents with the seniors later in the night. It was at one incident that I could see his enthusiasm when he was asked to do "Hasin pochh". He did it so well that seniors from adjacent rooms came to meet him. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Since that day I had seen various instances where his enthusiasm came over him and he cud perform even in pressure situations. Be it doing a hilarious skit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> in front of entire college which was prepared just few minutes ago (BTW he stole all my dialogues <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) or trying for Mr. felicity or singing Californication in the singing competitions. <br>I still remember when we were talking after our freshers' performance. Vayu's performance was decent <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and Agni had performed terribly <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . I could see how disturbed he was over a performance and on that he said to me that he will make a difference and try to perform better next time. Later he became cultural president of Agni, virtual cultural president of over batch, band leader of IIIT band "Avant Garde" <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .<br>He always used to try his best without thinking of the consequence. Like when in first year he tried for contesting elections as cultural representative of the batch. I remember I told him flatly that he will lose, but still he tried contesting the election and was happy that he tried. I think your attitude made you a winner <b>DUDE</b> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br>He was not only gud in cultural activities but also in studies. I was one of the lucky ones to get the room adjacent to him so I always used to take assignments from him before anybody else cud. <br>He never used to say even when I had denied him helping on few occasions. That's why I admire you.  He was the one who found a new way of copying assignments but putting it up on the blog. ( He didn't pursue that practise though <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) </b></i></ul><br><br>
