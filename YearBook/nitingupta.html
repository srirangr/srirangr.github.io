<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The word "tha" has been popularly associated with him, so his name turns into NiTHIn GupTHA. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>The first time I met him was as Pankaj's roomie. He tried very hard sometimes to wake Pankaj up, but he didn't wake up. The amazing part is that I lived in his hometown, Alwar for 1 year when I was in 4th class. First time I saw him I was reminded of "Kaa" from Mowgli. I had great time playing corridor cricket with him and others. We often meet in e-sagu lab. I had great time with him in Club 8 when I consumed alcohol in much greater quantity than ever before...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nitin Gupta is a really cool, good, reliable friend to have. He has been my neighbour for the first 2 years and in these 2 years we had loads of fun especially during the time when i was the only one with a PC. We have been very good friends right from the beginning and during no time had we had a fight among us. He is really good with whatever he does and has an interest in web technologies, web design and sports.<br><br>Speaking of him, I remember an incident from 3rd semester when I was horribly sick and I hadnt had anything to eat for the whole day, Nitin came to my door and asked me if I would like to have an burger from the canteen. I couldnt resist the offer on any day whether I was sick or not. Thats Nitin for you ... and hence he is considered to be helpful by all.<br><br>His skills in dancing is umatched because of the energy he carries in his dances. You can see him dancing when he plays volleyball too <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is almost good at all sports that he plays be it cricket, volleyball, or BasketBall [ He was in the college BB team and he had no experience whatsoever before coming to IIIT]. He is considered to be the king of Aim_Headshot in CS that shows how accurate he can be when it comes to aiming at the head.<br><br>Wishing you all the best for ur future ... keep in touch ... signing off ....

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nitin Gupta aka Gup"tha" aka Archangel<br><br>yaar tum logon ke CS vale naam main kabhi nahi bhool sakta. This has given me some of the best moments of my life. Anyway, lets start with the testimonial. Is bande se first 3 years kabhi jyada baat nahi hui. Till 3rd year, I used to know him as a guy who is a very good dancer and does Aari-2 on stage with Pappu and Chand. I interacted with him a bit when we danced together on stage for Aakash house, remember that Vassa Vassa, Pad ha roop karambu and all that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, what a time that was !! Then as our hostels got separated, so there was no chance of interaction. But I got to know this lean, thin and lambu guy in fourth year. It all started with TT where Rishi, him and me used to play TT together continuously for hours. Hum teeno ka aisa tha ki jab bhi bol do, teeno bande hamesha TT ke liye ready rehte the, fourth banda change hota rehta tha. Then we started playing volleyball together and he is quite good at that. Then we started playing CS together and I have spent some of the most memorable and cherishable moments of my life while playing that. Then we started gymming together as well aur ab bas basketball reh gaya hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. vo bhi khelenge. This guy is a jack of all trades. Har game khelta hai: cricket, volleyball, TT, cards, CS and what not. Padhai mein bhi sincere hai. A very good dancer as well but banda bahut hi seedha hai. iske saath bc karne mein bhi khoob maza aata hai. Iski udayi bhi bahut hai THA ke naam par. Fir is cultural night par to alag hi atmosphere tha. Guptha Uncle chhaaye hue the. Very down-to-earth guy who never gets rude. Apan to hyd mein hi hain, touch mein rahenge hi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Lets hope that our friendship grows stronger with time. All the best for all your future endeavours. Keep rocking. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Novirus <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Guptha bhai itne seedhe hain ki unko dekhke kutte ki poonchh bhi sharma ke seedhi ho jae. When I met him for the first time, my first impression was that he is a tall, extremely thin guy with some wierd dressing sense and an equally wierd hair style. When I interacted with him, some of his character came out and his kind heartedness won over everything else.<br><br>I believe he is the most simple and down to earth guy in his group and that's why he is the favourite victim of being leofyed by others. He made "tha" legendary and you must see his face when someone calls him GupTHA <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He is very helpful and socializes with many people in the college.<br><br>His dance style is just awesome. He is a  very good dancer but remains too stiff while dancing that his steps look weird. He needs to be a little more flexible.<br><br>A total fun loving guy who is always there to do BC and have fun. You will be staying in Hyderabad for a long time now and I hope we'll meet many more times after the college.<br><br>Good luck for the future and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My first impression of Nitin was this tall,lanky guy who wore this multi-colored shirt and had the most unique hairstyle <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We used to speak often in the first year and he's a very nice guy to talk to. I always felt that he is very simple and straightforward and extremely likable. Only advice would be improve your communications skills a bit because sometimes that may lead people to judge you differently.<br>      Somehow did not talk much in the second and third years but of late we have started talking again - atleast through chats <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.

So many Guptas r there in our batch ,but now gupta/gupTHA has been his permanent name .... nobody calls him nitin <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.  He has a particular type of voice which keeps his presence alive. Bhai hasta hai to aisa lagta hai jaise colgate ka ad kar rha hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Banda dancer hai .. 1st yr ka  "aari aari", i still remember that dance , group me 4 log the , charo apni alag duniya me dance kar rahe the <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .

He is very religious .... roj agarbatti jala ke pooja karta hai, ise dekh ke bachpan yaad aa jaya karta tha .. jab main bhi roz agarbatti jalata tha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . 1st yr me ise dekh ke maine bhi pooja karna start kar diya. <br>He is really a family guy, intern ke paise se ghar par sabke lie kuch na kuch lekar gya tha, it was so touching <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

He can be seen playing almost every outdoor game played in IIIT ( that doesn't mean he is in the team of those games <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ).... But yes he is quite active in those games as well as in most of the activities of our batch....<br>Our interaction was initially due to Basketball... Extremely gud in sports u can see him falling and getting injured in almost every game....  be it cricket or BB.... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> waise dude I haven't seen u falling during VB <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....  He is one of those guys whom every batch needs to keep up the things running because they are gud at everything.... You can ask him to organize in any events....  or also take part in any event... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Cricket with him in cellar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( only for a few days <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) or in OBH was very enjoyable as he plays with extreme dedication and enthusiasm...  BB maine toh he can understand my dard as he is also a rebounder <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> bahut saare matches saath khele hai.... iski ek baat acchi yeh hai ki he is always ready to learn more.... bahut sikhaya hai isko ( jabki mujhe khud nahin ata <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) but phir bhi ball dalne se pehle ek baar to dribble karega hi <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>Banda bahut acchha dancer bhi hai... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( He has won various inter and intra college dance competitions <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) I will always remember ur grp dance on stage where u were doing some step (with xtreme enthu ) and all the others doing a very different step <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ( later u told me that they forgot the step not u <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) but seriously he is very gud at dancing.... and can move his body <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> A  big time BC baaj the placements prep in his room is unforgetable...  Actually rishi being very gud at maths used to complete all the mathematical problems very fast and then both of us wud do it slowly slowly <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ( ok...ok...  you used to do the problems faster than me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )... <br>[contd.]</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nitin Gupta or Dr. Love (his dc nick <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), is my wing mate now in OBH.Jab bhi bore ho rahein ho toh gupTa ke rum chalein jao. He has ever smiling face. Always ready for BC .Thing about him that I like most is his ever adjusting nature. Banda sab type ke logo ke saath adjust ho jaata hain and he knows how to compromise situation <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>	We got introduced during one of A4 class by Mr. Jain. At that he was just a tall fellow of our A4 group. But English ki class mein bande ne khub mazze Karwaye hain.Altough he was from Hindi medium, he manages to get more marks than many of us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> At that time our interaction is very limited. Got to know him better during Vizag trip. Us trip mein toh alag hi mazza aaya tha  esp. pahad chadne mein <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Thanx to you guys <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> In 3rd and 4th yr, we have taken many courses together and class mein BC karte rehte hain. He was our guide in Vaishno devi. Shouting all the way, dancing on nagra and rajma-chawal khana will be some incidents I remember always. Is sem toh yeh bas ghar jaa rha har thode din mein <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but I think jitne time rehta hain hum khub aish karte hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>	Coming skills, He is a good dancer. Kai songs mein toh isne maharath haasil kar rakhi hain for ex. "Aari Aari".Whenever I dance on DJ night or Club8 or whatever, I just look him and try to copycat what he is doing <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Is now a FRIEND fan and used to watch him all the time . He is fond of collecting hindi videos, has almost 20 gb of them <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He keeps on d/ling videos from various sites <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Has a bad memory or distracted attention while watching movie. Esp. the case of "Fanna" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> He is god of Public transport. Always manages to get a b'ful gal in his vicinity. saala humari kismet hi kharab hain <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> Dr. Love is lucky when comes to girls, hopefully you will impress a girl in Hyd. (just to avoid long distance thingy).<br><br>contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>

Aisa lagta hain bachpan se PHP, javascript, AJAX etc. aati ho bande ko <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Was in web-team of Felicity'08.

Esagu mein toh 2 saal se ek hi cheej kar rahe hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .During placement he was damn focused and used to read all sorts of things. I was happy to volunteer for IVY. That night when HR was telling the names of selected , I was delighted when I heard your name .We (me and KBC) fought about who will tell you,but us k$#*ne ne call kar hi diya <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Anyway waiting for your treat now <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>	Coming to games, he plays cricket, Bball and TT very well=d). Bball mein girta rehta hain aise hi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but good at taking rebounds and is a good defender <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. TT khelte samay toh aisa lagta hain ki dance kar rha ho <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> pta nahin kaise-2 shot maarta hain samajh mein hi nahin aata <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br> His rum is our Casino in IIIT. He sits in his particualr positon while playing, believes that this will make him win, and is right <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> The team sitting there generally wins. Comes CZ, bhai kai map main toh aatank hain <b>archangel</b> ka. Sidha headshot. Us map mein toh isi ke saath rehne mein fayda hain.<br>Ek aur baat, yeh hamesha <b>100% sure ya 100% confident</b> rehta hain in case of fight in games. When you are in his team and you know he is wrong. Its hard to control yourself laughing, looking at his confidence and face expression.<br><br>Best of luck for your future and Will Miss u around <img src=Smileys/20.gif />.<br>Keep in touch always<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :-  BC@your rum, 29 , CZ , your ever helping nature.<br>Most Memorable moments : - Batch Trip, Summer'08, PLaying irrelevant that day <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and many others<br>Msg for U: - Bahut jaldi irritate mat hua kar and  Bhai sambandh aate hain toh photo rakh liya karo <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Nature se bahut hi <b>bhola</b> hai, hamesha khush rehta hai.<br><b>Dance</b> to awesome karta hai ^<img src=Smileys/3.gif />^ , "Aari aari" is one of his renowned performances along with "Aisa Jaadu". Cricket mein bhi jo match khelta hai wo hum jeet jaate hain, though he has little contribution <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Although he is not a good fielder, but took a sitter in the last match he played.<br>During placement he was placed before us, but gave me and bansi a lot of moral support <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Felicity'08 mein bhi he was one of the main organiser.<br>Ladkiyon ke maamle mein kaafi lucky hai, train ho, bus ho ya riksha ho, saale ko koi na koi mil hi jaati hai, aur bhola sa gupta bekaabu hokar fisal hi jaata hai. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>We have taken almost all the same courses during our B.Tech. aur classes mein khoob masti kari hai.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Nitin GuptHa.. Why the extra H? Well ask him, we've leofied him big time with it. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Poor guy, takes it all in his stride with a smile, hardly ever complaining <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> In fact, I've never seen this chap complaining for anything. Like Crouch in Pool or England, this chap is called up to play cricket only when there is an injury/absentism- but he never refuses. He always comes and gives in his best in the field. Its another matter that he is not the best of fielders around <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>But that is how Gupta is, he is very relaxed and is hardly ever agitated. I really appreciate him for that. He enjoys life to its fullest and has a good PR with most people. Its been cool hanging out with him. It was awesome to get placed together, and I do hope we have a lot of fun in Ivy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he represents: Peter Crouch<br>Fav memory: Gupta bugging us to visit Ivy and Himank and me putting it off.
