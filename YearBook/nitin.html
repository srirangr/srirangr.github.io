<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first time I met him was as Gaurav's roomie. He has really nice sense of humor. First time I saw him I was reminded of the Half-life's main character, Dr. Gordon Freeman. I had great time playing corridor cricket with him and others.<br>We often meet in e-sagu lab. I had great time with him in Club 8 when I consumed alcohol in much greater quantity than ever before...<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nitin Bansal is a really cool person to hang out with. He was my neighbour during 1st and 2nd year and we were good friends right from the beginning when Kharkwal introduced him to me. He is damn intelligent, lazy, talkative and is a very sound sleeper. He used to sleep like anything when he studied Maths for the exams.<br>     We used to play loads of FIFA matches together in 2nd year ..[ almost 2-3 hours daily for 2-3 Weeks] and I remember his Gaming Style by the "Malouda Kick" that he hit once .... it was a blinder and I was simply awestruck and was speechless at it. He and Kharkwal used to pull my leg at times during the first 2 years.<br>	I remember an instance where I had a class at 2PM and both Nitins were in my room at around 1:45PM ... we were playing Cricket on my PC [at that time only I had a PC in my room]. I had to goto class and I told Nitin that the only way he could continue using my PC was that I lock my room from the outside and goto class. Nitin agreed and I had locked him up for 1 1/2 hr with my PC. [SOrry for doing that It was a very immature action of mine].<br>	He is good at all Sports but the only thing he doesnt prefer to do is move so as long as He doesnt need to move he is an excellent player. His bowling in cricket is exceptional and has the knack of picking up wickets with ease [I still remember one of your balls to which i was clean bowled to].<br>	Now that you will be hyderabad expect you to be in touch with me. <br><br>Signing off ...

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nitin Bansal aka Bansi aka JAAT aka I_AM_HERE<br><br>Apna Haryanvi bhai hai ye to. The most witty person of UG2K5 I must say. Aise-aise comments maarta hai ki hasi control hi nahi hoti. Volleyball mein jis team mein main, bansi aur bajju hote hain, us team ko harana bahut tough kaam ho jata hai. ab to banda TT bhi khelne lag gaya hai. Bc jitni marzi karva lo isse. CS mein hum dono khoob maje aur bc karte hain. Dono hamesha ek hi team mein hoti hain aur nomercy(Sachin) doosri team mein hota hai. Fir iski help se main nomercy ko maarkar kuch bhi uski maarne vala message karta hun aur ye banda hamesha "lol" likh kar bhejta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Aajkal to volleyball mein bhi yahi karte rehte hain, hamesha opposite team vale ke liye lols par lols aate hain. Is bande ke saath bc karne ka alag hi maza hai. Keep rocking dude. Be the same as you are. Baki orkut par. God bless !!<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bansi aka Bansal was among those guyz which I hated the most during the first 3 years. I never wanted to talk to him. I don't remember the exact reason behind this but it has to do something with his attitue. But thigs changed and when I actually talked to him, my perception changed. Now we are on very good terms and its always been fun talkin to him.<br><br>He is damn funny and leofy people like playing a game. When he comes on leofying someone, his victim just goes speechless and I feel its better not to respond otherwise you'll have to face some serious consequences. Soem of the great memories associated with him will be the Nagarjuna sagar trip, CL classes and my CL taship. Bhai sahab 1 bottle beer mein out ho jate hain aur phir jo harkatein karte hain wo dekhne layak hoti hain <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>We are not great friends  and I feel you cannot be with many people but what matters the most is that we do not have any hard feelings against each other. This will be the most important thing that will matter after we'll all leave the college.<br><br>I'm sorry for thinking so negative about you initially but its all good if end is good, so forget everything I said in the first paragraph and remember me as your CL tutor <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Good luck.

Our bc rocks <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Bansi ke bare mein ek cheej famous hai...ise jab bhi poocho ..ki bhai chal rahe ho <br>...dinner ke liye ya phir Coffee shop ya kahin bhi..and if reply comes.. <b>tum chalo mein aata hoon</b> matlab its sure ki yeh nahin aane wala.. yeh iska style hai na kahne ka... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> iske bare mein ek cheej aur famous hai ki jab bhi ise sona hota hai yeh koi egnlish movie chala deta hai aur phir 15 20 min mein is neend aa jati hai...hmmm.That day the BC at top-floor and the very next day a stroll around campus at 3 am and then BC in my room were some awesome moments wid you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Last DJ was also a gr8 fun wid you being around <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  and i wont forget those fattas of urs.. <b>Dabur ki Goli Hajmola</b> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and <b> Chhamma - Chhamma </b>.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I'll remember Bansi as a very quick witted person. The situation just has to present itself, and he's there with a reply. I've seen so many occasions when he does that- and starts to leofy someone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His sense of humour is cheesy, and its fun to be in his company. Gupta, Rishi and he often hang out together and choose a victim for leofying at the drop of a hat <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Hes changed a lot over the years in his outlook, now he listens to rock, grows long hair and follows Arsenal FC. Hes also a fun loving guy, and his "Tu chalo, mein aata hoon" is well known <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . And yeah, I also remember his bowling along with the smooth action <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He worked hard for placements, and it showed the way he kept getting shortlisted for companies. I was happy when Rishi and he finally got placed in Motorola.. They really deserved it.

Whenever we go out he is our transport incharge, Decides how to go somewhere.He is always ready for outing and going out (except chat kar rha ho <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). <b>"tu chal mein aata hoon"</b> is famous line of him to avoid us from interrupting his talks/chats etc <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br>	We used to watch many movies together but halfway down the line bechara so jaata hain <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> , I remember the Al-Pacino weak, where we watched his 4-5 movies. I think now he hate him so much that hw will never see any of his movie. During 3rd year,took special care of hair to make it long enough for head banging in Felicity'08 <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> A rock fan and used to listen all sorts of english songs. Cricket mein bowler hain, I am proud that maine teri ball mein six mara hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Playing those galli cricket in cellar and OBH with you and arguing over runs and wickets <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> was entertaining. <br><br>contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Felicity'08, I got to see a different part of Him. Altough we decided to join celebration team for post felicity celebration <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> but with ease he goes on drinking and even smoking made me wonder <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Is it the same Bansi, I used to hangout, the nerdy looking boy could be like this. The night we spend laughing like hell while reading jokes from that site (somani ne link diya tha), I guess I never laughed that much. Remembering those moments still brings smile to my face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>	Follower of team Arsenal when comes to soccer.  Plays Fifa'08 very well. In CZ he is like extra count for person who finds him first <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> But pta nahin mujhe hamesha mar deta hain <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> He has improved a lot in CZ <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Taash mein toh bhai apna partner hain. Playing 29 with him is fun. He can explain everything he does altough it has been decided after hinting by partner <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> or some cheat <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He is the one who introduced me to beer <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif />. I think we always drank together and hopefully continue to do so. We share many jokes. <b>Roger</b><img src=Smileys/3.gif />, Rab dikh gya,dil,pyaar etc. are to name a few. We( me, sam and bansi) used to prepare for placement together. Often ends up doing BC <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He has excellent problem solving approach and equally good aptitude <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I wished you were placed that day in Yahoo but those assholes <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> (Just realized you would be in B'lore <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><img src=Smileys/20.gif />) But anyhow you were rock solid and with determination you headed I just have to <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I think he is the one in IIIT, by whom I am inspired a lot by his way of thinking and acts. Best of Luck for your future and May god Bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Will you the most <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br><b><br><br>Will Miss U for :-  29, witty remarks, outing, beer party, and many things <br>Most Memorable moment : - batch trip, Little Italy outing, All Beer parties.<br>Msg for U: - Please Please Please, join a B'lore based company. <br><br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nitin Bansal aka <b>Bansi</b> is one of the most <i>quick witted</i> person, I've come across with. He has a spl talent of cracking jokes at u now n den & has a strange but funny kind of sense of humor.<br>"...Appearence can be deceptive"..Yes he is the live example of it. What appeared to me in the 1st year, a studious person was actually a actually a fun loving guy. He has changed a lot since then, pehle bilkul dabbu dikhta tha, abhi rockstar ban gaya hai.<br>TV shows, movies dekhne ka ultimate chaska laga bansi ko college aane ke baad, but a small request, <b>pls movies dekhte waqt so mat jaaya kar</b> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . FIFA bhi awesome khelta hai.<br><b>Height of Frustaapa</b> : Frist year mein jab kisi ke paas laptop nahi tha, tab dandu ke room mein Nitin* ne classes bunk maarke ultimate stuff dekha hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>Overall, a very nice and caring person to be with. We have spent ample time discussing all weird things frm fiction to gals, uncountable nightouts playing taash.....<br>share some common interets, mode of thinking, BTP, copmany....<br>He is an awesome pal, someone with whom u wud like to be friends with forever...All the best Bansi for your future, hope we'll get our joining letter soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
