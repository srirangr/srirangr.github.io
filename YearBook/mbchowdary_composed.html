<br>
<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I guess this testimonial would be incomplete without mentioning the Federer-Nadal match incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Ok! i wont give the details because others have already written about it, but it shows how incredibly passionate she is about certain things. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Although we have different tastes in movies and music - she loves old b/w hollywood flicks and i totally hate watching movies released before the year 2000! <img src=Smileys/10.gif />; i love listening to indie and alt rock! and she's into more traditional rock, pop and sometimes country music ( country music?? seriously <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) - but we are not entirely different when it comes to these things. She's a huge Coldplay fan, so there's atleast one band we both like, that's a plus. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>If you talk to her a few times you'll know how awesome she is at narrating incidents and telling stories. I dont know about others but i was never bored when she keeps talking about things like her school life and all those interesting incidents and 'adventures' she had with her gang! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sometimes she has a habit of repeating incidents/stories but thanks to my poor memory <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and the fact that everytime she tells those things in a very interesting way you dont get bored!<br><br>One thing i've realized recently is that she's also a great listener ( i was slightly surprised to be honest <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) and she's incredibly mature when it comes to certain things. I think it's because she knows and understand things very quickly. I havent met anyone who knows and understands people like she does.<br><br>I wish i've known you before but it's been great getting to know you in this short time and it's been a real fun, interesting and first of its kind (i've never been on a rollercoaster ride before <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ....kidding! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) journey! and i really hope it'll continue to be equally fun and interesting, if not more, in future. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Just when i started learning to live with the fact that i made a huge mistake by choosing ece over cse, i've got to know you! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And then the "kicking-myself-for-being-in-ece" phase started all over again <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and i kept asking myself "why the eff did i not shift to cse at the end of 1st year!?!" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Again!, thanks to me being in ece and the lack of common courses, except for cog sci (and u dont remember i was there in those classes!!! ante le! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ), and since i was practically living in my own little cave all those years there was no proper interaction between us ( only those occassional 'hey's and 'hi's ) But i have to thank google for making something like gtalk (aah! was trying not to say anything geeky here! eff! couldnt control myself <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) without which all those interesting and 'historic' <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> chats wouldn't have happened.<br><br>We started talking because of all those tv shows we keep watching! I never thought there'd be someone who'd watch that many tv shows. she probably watched more eps than i did! that's like crazy!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> the difference is that she maintains a good gpa and i dont. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Seriously, how did u manage that!?!? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> OTH was like the most discusssed tv series in our conversations, we both are like huuuge fans of that show. She's also super crazy about Entourage, House and Friends, which are like the best shows ever (although i havent watched Friends i can guess its awesomeness looking at how people, especially her, can go on for hours talking about it! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )<br><br>Among many things, what sets her apart is her awareness and knowledge in a variety of issues and topics. Whether it's sports, WWE <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , politics, movies, music or even celebrity gossip <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> she always has something interesting to say. I believe there are very few people who would understand and have an accurate idea/opinion on so many things!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd...<br><br>He's always calm and rarely get's angry. Eventhough he could've retorted back when i used to behave like a guy who could kick his ass and give all those gaalis he never said anything <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But then like i said in ranga's testi, i've pissed off even maruti! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But i'm glad he soon forgot about it and we've got back to having fun as usual in our wing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I'd miss you da! but dont worry i'll be visiting bengaluru atleast once a month and i was serious when i said we'll be partying all weekend with your money! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Hats off to you da! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>all the very best for your future and hope you'll soon get a gf in bengaluru <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd...<br><br>Ok now that part where i list out all the great qualities he has! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He's a great friend, total fun to hang out with, unique dancer ( he'll make anyone rophal<br>with his dance steps. they are seriously that funny and good at the same time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), totally awesome and funny when it comes to talking in hyderabadi hindi, cares a lot for his friends and goes to any extent to help them out no matter what the situation is ( there are very few people i've met who'd do so much for their friends ), a total g33k! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> a great coder and hacker!<br><br>so now the other part! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He's really really lazy ( but not as lazy as me! ). I used to wonder how he'd spend all that time in the lab working. Probably deepti was always behind him! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Nah! he's really hard working when it matters and the rest of the time he just needs a little push! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One thing that always puzzles me is his addiction towards NSFW articles <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All those articles/links that he shares on google reader and twitter! sometimes i'm like OMG!WTF! some of them are really good tough <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and of late i've been checking only the shared articles on gReader and his are the most interesting ones <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Aah how can forget about music! he's a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge  eminem fan! and loves hip-hop and rap. Is also into rock and metal at times. ever since i lent my speakers to him he's been killing us with all the weird music<br>that he listens to! Psychedelic rock!?! dude what the eff music is that!?!?! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>ever since i've been trying to learn hindi, he's been patiently listening to all my pathetic attempts at giving "gaalis" in hyderabadi hindi! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Dude why didnt<br>u ever correct me when i used to say "kya chutiye hai re tum" all the time! <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> It's because of you that people are leofying me when i talk in hindi!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Thanks to felicity 08 a lot of good things happened in my life! and getting to know maruti and deepti is one of the them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He and deepti had so much entu <br>towards the promo video and wanted to do so much to make it a huge success, but i tho didnt give them too much work because they used to stay in the lab<br>most of the time and work so much for their honors project <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . did not want them to waste time in learning all those softwares and i ended up giving them smaller tasks of splitting videos, choosing photographs and stuff like that! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> sorry for giving u those boring tasks da! I tho didnt care about my acads back then so i was working on the video like an hour before exams too! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>They did any work that was given with so much dedication! that's what i like in them. donno if maruti was forced to do all that work by deepti <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but i'm glad u both were there in the team! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> It was because of u guys that i used to tell myself "c'mon stop lazing around and finish up ur work. look at them and learn!" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> although that self talk didnt do much help but that awesome video wouldn't have been possible without you guys! and i'm not exaggerating here.<br><br>It was after working together for the video that we got close and became best buds <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We were also the organizers of 3-4 online events in felicity. aah! sculpt!!! how can i forget that event. so many things happened related to that event! not all good though <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but we had a blast all along! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He did so much promotion for that event! used all his g33ky skills <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , spammed forums and websites like hell! we got participants from canada and other countries (whose names i dont remember!) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I got to know more about him when i used to visit the cvit lab whenever i got bored sitting in cogsci lab! all those short bc sessions, all those gay jokes we were subjected to! ( i hate deepti <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ), the nfs races we used to play on that aahsome system! great times right! It's been even more fun since he moved into our wing.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd...<br><br>I still remember the reaction he had on his face when he was listening to that song. That night we listened to that song atleast 30 times! We planned so much for the video, the dance steps, the scenes; i actually wrote down what should be done at what time, how and where the scenes have to be shot, the camera movements and the effects, in a book! We were that serious about<br>making it. Well we still have some time left. Hopefully we'll be able to make it! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>But he gets really lazy at times, sometimes too lazy to even go to mess! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and gives lame excuses like i had a heavy breakfast and stuff <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> i guess he's secretly dieting! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I've been an introvert all these years! didnt really share things close to my heart, be it happiness or sorrow, with anyone! But of late, i've changed and started to be more open. I dont really know why but i've been sharing a lot of things with our gang, especially ranga! Had so much happening in my life lately, he's been a great listener <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sharing all those good things with him has made us even more close friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Anything, good or bad he would be the first person to know!<br><br>aah! want to write so much more da! but telling all this and saying "you rock mama! all the best for your future!!" makes it sound like you'll be going away to some other place! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Me waiting for your appointment letter da! We need to go house hunting as soon as it's confirmed that you'll be posted in hyd! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I can already imagine the fun we'll be having staying in an apartment <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It was because of sharat (ranga was his roomie) that i've started talking to him. Although we had very little interaction in the first 2 years, i'm glad we've become close friends in a short time! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And boy! this guy's full of energy! There's never a dull moment when he's around and it's such a gift to be so much fun and totally entertaining irrespective<br>of the place and time! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Our gang wouldnt have had all those fond memories and aaahsome outings if he wasnt there!<br><br>His knowledge on hindi music and movies is amazing. He actually remembers the "release dates" of many hindi movies. That's crazy!!! Who the eff remembers<br>that sorta info about a movie!?!? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> If he's in your team, whether it's antakshari or DumbC, you can be sure that the other team would sweat! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We had so<br>much fun playing antakshari and dumbC on the new building! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's like the Bollywood encyclopedia!<br><br>Everyone knows he doesnt get pissed off easily and you rarely see him get "really" angry. But i have the reputation of pissing off even the coolest people.<br>I've pissed off almost everyone in our gang, even ranga! It was during placements and he wasnt in a good mood after writing an exam and i was repeatedly<br>saying something and at one point it really ticked him off! But the great thing about him is he forgets things like these very quickly and gets back to his<br>usual fun self in a blink! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>For the last couple of months he kept saying, "i'm bored da!" all the time. He got tired of staying in his room i guess and always wanted to do something! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Thanks to him these last days have been more fun and exciting than usual. We planned to do so much, but again my laziness and the work i got myself entangled to sorta stopped all those plans from being implemented. I remember the first time i listened to "Harilo ranga hari" song from Billa, i ran to his room, downloaded it silently and made him listen to it. I was like "ranga!! this song was created just for you".</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Right from the first year when he, along with somani and abhilash, used to crack all those coding contests, i used to wish i had some of this skills and qualities. He's an amazing coder and the most creative person i've met. He's insanely aaahsome and has this very unique style when it comes to writing. His creativity with words is simply superb. Thanks to felicity, many people know he's unique in many more ways. <br><br>Sometimes his actions make him look like the geekiest person in the batch! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I think he lives in his own fantasy world sometimes! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We always catch him daydreaming or should i say, thinking about something totally different from what we all would be discussing! And it's because of this, Vinay ( the most notorious member of our gang! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) leofies him! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He's smart and intelligent but in certain things he's still a kid! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And yeah! how can i forget about food!<br>He's such a foodie, he doesnt care what he's eating sometimes. If it "looks" like food then it has to go into his stomach! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>We had our share of dull moments but i believe it's because of these ups and downs that we've gotten to know each other better and our friendship has grown stronger.<br><br>We had so many ideas for many creative projects (blogs, comics, short films, spoofs and many more), it was mostly because of my laziness and the lack of proper time management on my side and my involvement in many things at a time that most of those got confined to the white board. But i'm glad we'll be working together for atleast for a year more and i'm sure we'll make atleast a couple of them a reality <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>aah! so much more to write...will write them down after i've written testimonials for the rest of the Gangsta Gang! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Dont really remember when and how we started interacting, i guess it was during<br>one of those bc sessions that sharat, prateek and prudhvi keep having, in the class<br>sitting behind me in B section. OMG! these three used to do so much raccha, gani<br>and i ( we were like the 'accha bacchas' back then, "trying" to listen to the<br>lectures <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ) used to laugh our asses off! Then the English classes!!! It was<br>'heaven' for all of us in B2! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We were like the luckiest bastards! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> If anyone<br>saw our English class, it would seem like a scene straight out of Happy Days<br>movie! <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>There are so many aaahsome memories like these right from the first semester, so<br>many interesting conversations, hours of bc - most of the time they were on<br>the lines of "How different it could've been if we werent in ECE!" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I remember,<br>both of us were in this huge dillema, whether to shift to CSE or not and for<br>some stupid reason we decided not to (and we kick ourselves even now, for not<br>taking advice from the right people). But we've realized everything happens for<br>a reason and probably we wouldnt have had the chance to work together on all those<br>interesting project and ideas if we werent in ECE!<br><br>It was because of those projects and the time we spent in trying to make all <br>the new ideas/plans, which we keep having every other day, a reality that we<br>got to know each other better. there was a time when we used to get new ideas<br>for the "next big thing" like every day! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And i used to spend hours making<br>"5-year plans" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> right from the design of the logo for that application/product<br>to dreaming about the millions of bucks it would make! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>It didnt take much time for me to realize we're similar in many ways ( he's<br>little more g33kish than me though <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) and we were in similar situations and had<br>similar plans for our future. He doesnt want to be just another guy in the crowd<br>and he doesnt have to try to be unique. He does things "jaara hatke" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
