<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>As Siva has mentioned in his profile, I indeed would remember him as 'Our SivaReddy. You Call him for any help. You won't regret it.' Each and every word of it is true....i've experienced it at d time of placements...i would call him late nights asking for sm work or other to b done and tht too at very short notice...i would thn sleep and d next day i would find d work perfectly done before i reach d venue....hats off to u Siva <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>he's a very nice person to talk to...very cheerful...very friendly and yes a studious guy...but Siva I foresee a great friend in you, so u hv to live up to tht...i'm here in Gachibowli ur neighbour...u do plan to drop by frequently at M$...it will b fun man... <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If by any chance the shakti machine in LTRC wing gets damanged, they will replace it with Shiva Reddy - the Shaktimaan of IIIT-H. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Came to know more about him through YV Sandeep. Both were/are/will be certified geeks working on some hacking tricks, reading some tech blogs and linux freaks. He helps everyone/anyone anytime without expecting any kind of favor from the other side. Has been very helpful during the first phase of placements when there was a shortage of volunteers. I am sure lots in store for you in IIIT Hyderabad and one day you will surely be a well known researcher. Be the same.<br><br>Good luck! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Shiva bhai, I could never tell you on face but i have told many about u that you are one of finest person i have ever come across. I am your fan dude. I have hardly seen ppl so helping like you. I still remember when i used to approach for any linux problem and you have never said no to me. Sometimes incidents so small but makes a deeper impact. Then once your laptop was lost and i was very upset wanted to help you out by any means. <br><br>Then one incident, despite of MS student his contribution in placements is quite appreciable. I once called him late in the night and asked him to prepare a seating arrangement for placements and stick it outside the rooms early in the morning. And this chap so gladly said 'sanket you need not worry i will do it'. You may not agree but such small things fueled me a lot to work for my batchmates in placements.<br><br>Shiva you have inspired many in college and outside college. I hope to keep relations with you life long. be the same dude. there is so much to write but time never allows me to do <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>     I,for the first time started talking to him, I guess during placements. He was really very supportive throughout those testing times and especially on the day I got placed. He and Kranthi came to the placement venue for some other reason Looking at how disappointed I was about the absolute mess which was created by the CIQ HRs, they both stuck by me, boosting my completely down morales from 7 till 10:30 in the night, not once leaving by my side. I was and I am even now overwhelmed by the exceedingly sweetness of your heart on that day for being so so supportive. Had it not been yours and Kranthi's support, I would have totally jacked my final round of interview. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Then, Samvedana came into life and through his involvement I got to know more about him. <br><br>        He is a real nice guy, gem at acads and the one who is really really helpful to all his friends <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . Now that I know a lot of things about him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , I give him a lot of tough time, pulling his leg and it is absolute fun talking to him. Yet, he is so humble and simple with a pleasant smile always on his face. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br><b>Message for you :<.b> Learn to be more assertive. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Wishing you truck loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>By default people(boys, girls) like him. When someone comes for help to Siva, he is never going to let them down. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Being a project partner for more than a year let me write a few unique aspects i saw in him. His enthusiasm makes you feel the huge amounts of work look tiny. Fortunate to have him as project partner. It is fun to work with him. In this quest we have discovered certain aspects in Indian Languages(wrote a paper on it too). <br><br>He has a great ability to adapt across various abstractions. For example, he can work with any programming language, can handle any operating system, can configure hardware of across various machines, can work with kernel level codes, can craft complex software-composites, can hack websites, ... Needless to say people call him <b>Linux</b> Reddy. Probably this aspect <i>to adapt across various abstractions </i>distinguishes a computer science professional from other professionals. <br><br>I appreciate his intimacy with professors. In one of our project meetings, he asked professor Sangal, "Can you explain it? You can explain better than me ?". Prof.Sangal had no other option and he had to explain. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Now coming the sports side, he is a good volley-ball player. Hope i will see him playing again daily. <br><br>I have a lot more to say. Will write them again. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future raa <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
