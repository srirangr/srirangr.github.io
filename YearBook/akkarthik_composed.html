<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>So here goes, i m finally writing a testimonial for my ex-room partner and my best friend Prateek Gunda Vijay. We both knew each other at around 10th class itself, both of us went to the IIT coaching center known as Sharma, we used to sit in the last bench and do a lot of BC in place of reading. Those days were a lot of fun since he used to be one of psycho srinu favourite students<br><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br> We then met once again during the AIEEE counseling, after meeting him i realized that he was once of the biggest geeks in his corporate jail(Narayana), this guy timings used to be from morning 6 to nite 11 <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif />, a complete opposite to my timings.<br> After comin to IIIT, both of us became room mates, i really have to thank him for bearing me(i used to sleep at 10 which was abnormal in IIIT) <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. During the second year, we use to watch a lot of sitcoms together, he was the person to introduce me to scrubs( He is absolutely crazy about it, u can see that from his profile), we also started playin FIFA at around this time and it was really fun beating him again and again,(but hats off for trying, <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), he could only manage to beat me once.<br> After the 2nd year, this guy went from being normal to hyper. He was the first person in our batch to publish a research paper <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br>and he also did his BTP under VU reddy ( The main reason i think he choose VU was that he wanted to find someone who could play the role of Perry Cox in his life, btw it seems he has found his elliott). Inspite of being in the toughest panel, he aced his BTP. <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br> btw this guy is a big fan of Arsenal a team which never wins and he trys to compare it to chelsea. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He is also one of co-founders of the infamous fight club( the other being me), but this guy doesnt even have the stamina or power to run. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br> Nowadays he is busy with the activities of his  new organization SAMVEDANA, hats off for doing something when most people only take about doing things. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shashankl.html>shashank lagishetty</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the few dual degree students whose company i really enjoy. A cool guy who is also a crazy fan of wwe just like me, always keeps humorous status messages which are always great fun to read at.(The one abt RAMU was the best for me). He goes to his house almost every week <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> but inspite of this manages to ace all of his courses. From what i hav heard he is also an awesome TA(especially DC). <br><br>P.S1: Dual degree naah! Dual degree guys rocks (courtesy Ram Reddy)<br>P.S2: H.B.K ends the deadman Streak at April 5th </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=marepallybhanu.html>M.Bhanu Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This fella is one of the two bhanu who i know from our batch. He is my mess-buddy who i drag to the NBH mess everyday, quite a dedicated fellow who loves to play PC games and football(especially CZ- this guys plays this game the whole nite even on the days of the exams and i think his CS name suits him quite well - Psycho)<br>He works out in the gym a lot and the only guy i think in our batch with a six-pack. But the thing which i will remember him,is the number of times i woke him up only to find that he went to sleep again.<br><br>P.S: All of best wishes for your future.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Rama Reddy, one of five ECD bakras of our batch(me inlucded), When i saw him for the first time, i thought he would be one of dadas of our batch. But as it turned out, he turned out to be one of the brainest, coolest guys in our batch. I would always remember the first time that i went to his room (It left me speechless to be honest). Overall a cool guy to hang out with and do BC regarding our so-called MS.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Vicky Anna, the only guy in our batch who can speak tamil other than me and watches more tamil movies than i ever did, a guy whose status message is always available or Amarok, a linux geek who helped me a lot of times with my WLAN linux problems, a guy who lives, sleeps and eats biryani (no kidding here folks, he eats hyderabadi biryani almost 10-15 times a month). Overall a cool and extremely fun guy to hang around with. <br><br>P.S: when are u giving the placement party<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>'B' to the 'H' to the 'A' to the 'N' to the 'U' is among the coolest guys in our batch. cool person to do BC with, the only other person i knw who is more crazier than me for WWE. However always makes the wrong preditction for the matches.<br><br>P.S: The Age of orton begins at April 5</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sankhlecha.html>Bharat Sankhlecha</a></b>&nbsp;<br>What can i say, the guy who eats pizza atleast twice a week, drinks 20 cups of tea per days and spends most of the day doing BC with everyone in sight (including profs like julu). He is a cool guy who nevers get paid his TAship stipend.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
