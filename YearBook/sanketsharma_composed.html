<b>For <a href=ahmed.html>Asrar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Asrar bhai congrats for your wonderful publication. Right from the first semester I kept asking to mingle up with as many as possible. chill out with your batchmates. But he preferred to be kinda reserved.<br><br>But yes onething is true you go to him anytime for help, he will never say no to you. Infact I remember for C and DS assignemtns, we often used to rush to him for help. Lekin aksar ye sirf dhingra ko batata tha.<br><br>Inshallah tum life mai khub progress karo aur ek ke baad ek paper publish hote rahe. lekin ye nahi ki mujhe bhul jaao. khuda aafiz!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Awesome comedy karta hai. Humesha hasta dekha hai maine isse. He was my wingmate for three years. He made our whole wing lively. you will never feel bored in his company. The way he speaks is unique and can make anybody laugh with it. I have also seen him serious couple of times considering his MS.<br><br>First year mai koi bhi assignment ho ta tha aur mere paas aata tha kahin se jugad ne ke liye. aur midsems mai iske paas.<br><br>In second year I made him start AGE. He got so crazy about this game that whole summers he spent playing AGE. He picked up the game so fast that in sometime he started defeating me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Mohit kaho maglu kaho has its peculiar style of doing things. I am impressed jis tarah se ye apni marwaleta hai aur usmai bhi khush rehta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Maglu be the same but now its time you develop your personality too and talk as matured one, your talking style should reflect the new maglu, childhood days are gone. This is the just the advice. <br><br>I am happy to be placed in a city where you are there for atleast a year. bas ek baar offer letter aajaye <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>best of luck for your future in MS.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Thanks shikha for the 'unexpected' 'wonderful' 'emotional' 'funny' testimonial... It's good to hear that you missed your lunch for this, but i have missed plenty of lunch and dinners working out things that you have mentioned. But the appreciation from all sides make me forget all those pains for a while.<br><br>Shikha is one among the two north indian girls who joined IIIT in our batch. Before I joined the college I had already figured out Shikha punjabi in the list of would be IIITians'05. <br><br>First year ki baat hai, in CO Lab Test I was sitting next to her and asked her to help me out. She said okay but when test started she had turned her monitor otherside and refused to show. I somehow made two codes, one gives an out as 1 and other gives an output 0, I made TA fool and got full number in the lab test. And she was still struggling with the code. I told her softly 'lage raho mai chalta hun' sarcastically. But now i realise after four years that she is helpful just that she didn't want to screw in grades. <br><br>She is childish, fun loving, and charming girl. She is a bundle of dedication and determination which is quite visible from her performance in placements and CAT score. <br><br>Iske saath aap kabhi bore nahin ho sakte, ghanto tak baith ke BC kar sakte ho. She has endless things to say. she has a very cute smile which makes me hang for a while and say 'hi' to her even when I am in hurry.<br><br>Have a good time ahead. Its good that you are in hyd. Will have second part of the story in corporate life.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>KBC was a period and not a name, in which he started to become famous in our batch. A lot more goes to his basket ball skills. With time he switched from one group to other but in this process it has helped him in finding new friends.<br><br>Kuch achi kuch khatti baatein inki. Ek to bhai sahab inhe hamesha haste hue dekho ge. Captain of basket ball team itself tells his stories in sports. You should see him playing how serious he get in the game.<br><br>Bahut BC maarta hai bhai kisiko nahin chhodta. Haan lekin inki lo to ye kam njoy karte hai.. Iss semester mai BC ka aisa shok chhad gaya hai ki naye naye spots dhunde gaye BC karne ke liye. specially the hill top.<br><br>Placements mai inka koi jawab nahin internship ke time se hi bajju bhai placements mai lag gaye the.. koi sa bhi question le aao answer to muh pe rata rehta tha. Inse placement mai ke dauran hum ne bhi kaafi kuch seekha. Aur fir Hamare batch ke placement opener rahe hai. <br><br>Amazon should be proud to take you.<br><br>memories: First project dkdbms humesha yaad rahega.<br><br>good luck for your future. and yeah I have misunderstood you at times and now regret.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Banga Banga Banga chilla chilla kar khub cheer kya. Tab se ab tak zuban par sirf banga hi likha hai. Ek baar tera phone aaya ghar pe ' mai randeep bol raha hun' and i was like kon randeep. <br><br>Randeep yaar tune bahut padaya hai. I am impressed with your dedication towards anything you do whether it is studies or placements or social work. <br><br>I came more close to this chap when we were working for one single goal to place our batchmates. He is honest and hardworking. Lot of work is handled by him and aditya till me and sambhav were placed. Thanks for getting us placed dude.<br><br>I am happy that you are in Hyd, we will have lot of fun here.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bharadwaj, we were unfortunate not to have you in OBH <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I have interacted with him couple of times but never felt that we are someone diff from each other at all. Last year after i had refused to go on batch trip, it was worth appreciating his efforts in makin a batch trip but unfortunately because of college policies it could not happen. Sometimes I feel sorry for my decision too. <br><br>I remember the day when he came to me this year and asked me 'sanket will plan trip this year' I was glad with his gesture.<br><br>He is polite, never seen him angry, friendly and i am impressed by his simplicity of thoughts.<br><br>Man be the same and haan don't forget me.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This one name khurana had fascinated me for long time. People used to give examples of him, padai karo to khurana ki tarah. Ye determination, dedication ka ek putla hai. I remember when he had first performed in AIMCAT and could not score well. But i could see the fire in him. Not just being the topper of ece or proving himself in studies, he has shown his talent in organising too with a successful robocamp. He loves travelling too. Always kept asking me if there is any trip in near future.<br><br>I never liked this man in my initial days, sorry to mention this. This is because of your attitude after diwali incident jab mera kurta jala diya tha. But he has changed quite a lot. He is much more mature and has become a helping hand to many. <br><br>You have inspired many in college and outside college with your determination and dedication.<br><br>Things will not miss trip to ettipothala waterfalls and new year party. There is lot more to write but time doesn't allow <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Shiva bhai, I could never tell you on face but i have told many about u that you are one of finest person i have ever come across. I am your fan dude. I have hardly seen ppl so helping like you. I still remember when i used to approach for any linux problem and you have never said no to me. Sometimes incidents so small but makes a deeper impact. Then once your laptop was lost and i was very upset wanted to help you out by any means. <br><br>Then one incident, despite of MS student his contribution in placements is quite appreciable. I once called him late in the night and asked him to prepare a seating arrangement for placements and stick it outside the rooms early in the morning. And this chap so gladly said 'sanket you need not worry i will do it'. You may not agree but such small things fueled me a lot to work for my batchmates in placements.<br><br>Shiva you have inspired many in college and outside college. I hope to keep relations with you life long. be the same dude. there is so much to write but time never allows me to do <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bhanu deserves more than what everyone has written for him. He is someone who always consult his heart for every decision. I admire him for plenty of things. He maintains relation with almost everyone in our batch. We have been planning batch trips rite from the first year, including the one chirkut. I have never felt lonely in his company.<br><br>I remember that he had motivated me and gave me inputs to include in my farewell speech and that had helped me compose a better one.<br><br>And yeah don't forget that Gridstone drama. It was a good experience in all.<br><br>Man work hard for you MS, I know you have a bright future ahead. I am in hyd only so will meet quite often.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kalkote the favourite of many here in college. Atleast he is one of my favourite. I know him since the first mid-sems. Somebody was telling 'kya padna kalkote hai na ek raat mai sab karadega. Daddu you also come to cellar, he teaches wonderfully'. Bhaiyon seriously iske padane ka tarika and he depth in the subject undoubtedly the best in the batch. I have always admired him for his knowledge. Finally he has proved and google took away our jewel. <br><br>Recently we had an excursion to Bastar with him, despite his hand fracture he never let us feel anything and he joined in every sport we did. I sometime feel sorry for his accident meri hi bike se gira tha bechara <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>I have hardly seen him tensed or angry, always smiling. Keep it up dude.. I have plenty of things to rite. but time never let me do this. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Scientist. very early memory with this chap is from the first year when I often used to hang around in his room with Atul. I knew very little about him then. Onething for sure, he was very good to atul's friend. I admire him the way he has adjusted with Atul for two years. iske room mai ek samay mai kaafi log ghuse rehte the aur BC chalti thi. I can very well remember the day when atul and aniket were playing guitar, Bajaj was doing BC and I was sketching. Despite of all this noise and disturbance he was busy reading a novel.<br><br>Tab itne PJs ka collection nahi tha iske paas. But ab to bhai har line infact har word pe ek fatta mapped hai. He claims that its his unique way to defend against enemies. And to some extent it has workout for him. <br><br>Man I am impressed by your innocence and miss you for some of your wonderful fattas. Good wishes for your wonderful career ahead. May god bless!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Iss veere ko jisne ek baar ache se samajh liya wo isse kabhi apne se dur nahin jaane dega.<br><br>v for veer makes sense to some extent. I still remember the very initial days of IIIT, when you used to come to my room and we talked about Kota ke kisse. You also used to tell me about your stories of bravery. You boasted a lot about Rajputs.<br><br>I know you will say that I should not write her name in public forum but could not resist, but you spent complete year in voice chat with her. This man was so crazy of her that he used to get asleep chatting whole night with her.<br><br>Then in summer of 06 you came to Jodhpur, it was lot of fun to pick you up from your aunt's home and watching Dil chahata hai at home. I had to leave for college the next day so unfortunately could not give him more time. But mere veere ek baar fir aayio, is baar tujhe daddu da tashan in Rajasthan ki saer karaunga.<br><br>fkd [fachchon ke daddy] ke upar to kya kehna. Isse na jaane fachchon se itna kya lagav tha ki pura second year fachchon ke room mai nikaal diya. I remember the day jab fachche iski bday par iske liye cake laaye the. man it was surprising.<br><br>Lekin ek baat hai, you had been very moody, kuch ache dost banaye aur fir unse hi dur ho gaye. kuch pe apni shakti ka pradarshan kar diya. MS ko ek khel samajh liya. Share Market mai paisa dala to sone ke ande dene wali murgi banaliya.<br><br>Veer jo bhi hai, now its time you become stable and plan strong for future. But jo bhi hai duniya tujhe yaad rakhegi...<br><br>tera dost,<br>daddu</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kya time tha dost, wo first year ki yaadein.. Munna bhai in IIIT.. Got lot of appreciation for that. You are really talented. Man with skills of mimcry, mono acting, singing, dance like hrithik, sense of humour and what not.<br><br>I was highly impressed by you in first year ofcourse aaj bhi hun par tab ki baat alag thi. You were at your best in stage shows. <br><br>I remember in the beginning of the second year you, me, bhartiya, mehta, parminder used to sit and chat long hours on the issue of ragging. Everytime I used to think ki shayad I have made some sense to you last night but agle din se fir wahi. But I liked your never-say-die spirit. You fought hard for the social cause. <br><br>Aaj bhi tujhe kahin road pe chalta dekhta hun to fir se sab taza ho jata hai. Dil karta hai ki kabhi fir se wo samay laut aaye. I still feel it was unfortunate that you could not win Mr. Felicity, which you actually deserve.<br><br>there is lot more to write for you but the time never allows me. just 2 hours to go for the deadline <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Aur abhi lambi list padi hai likhne ko.. kabhi bhuliyo mat dost.. aur haan wo yaad rahega tera dehradun wala bartav <img src=Smileys/10.gif />... I will pay you in the same coin.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mridulgupta.html>Mridul Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Net chal raha hai ki nahin ya nal mai paani kyon nahin aa raha, sirf is baat tak ko leke second floor se NBH 50 mai aa tapak ta tha. Kai baar to mai aur kabra used to scare each other arey soja, light off karde, warna mridul aajayega <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But if I say all in one you will never find somebody as helping as mridul. You will never find somebody with so much knowledge about cricket. You will never find anyone as good american accent as him.<br><br>I remember once a night before Maths exam. I could not prepare well. jisse padana tha mujhe ofcourse raman wo khud nahin pad paya tha. I had no option to study myself. Mridul came to room to discuss questions with kabra. Mai iske aksar maze liya karta tha. It just happened that he asked me a question. It was 2AM in the night and paper was scheduled at 8:30 in the morning. He found that I knew nothing and will fail for sure. I requested him to teach me whatever he knows. Despite of that entire maze lena he sat down with me and taught me from that first chapter to last till 5 in the morning. I could not thank him till date. <br><br>Very often we used to argue on silly topics and I enjoy those moments. With this we used to come up with different views to defend ourselves and it was a good excerise.<br><br>Fourth year tak aate aate mridul researcher ban gaya. He published his research paper and second one to go soon. <br><br>Good luck for your future in MS from US and hope soon you receive offer letter from verizon.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dhingra.html>Hemant Dhingra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Comes in to my wing, striking his fingers together chit-chit chit-chit and shouts maaaaaaaaaaaaks from the start of the wing 'movie chalna hai kya'. Uske baad mujhe pata hai ki mere paas aayega for movie. To lure me he used to say sab chal rahe hai. When i ask kon kon he says mai mridul aur tu. When I ask konsi jaa rahe hai he says some random movie never heard before. Basically all together i want to say is that he is big fan of watching movies. Kabhi bhi chale jaao kabhi mana nahin karta.<br><br>First year mai c ke codes ka ye ek bada source hua karta tha. I used to count him like anything. Kahin se nahin mila to dhingra de hi dega. I still count him the same for help. <br><br>I know in some ocassions i have pissed him. Lekin badi jaldi he forgets things in past and rejoins with spirit. He had shared almost everything with me in first two years. His innocence, simplicity and passion for sports have impressed me a lot. Iske dil mai jo kuch hota hai wo muh pe keh deta hai.<br><br>He is best TT player of our college. I have always enjoyed his game in finals for last 3 years. Thoda tense ho jata hai while playing. Bich mai basket ball ka bhi chaska chada tha lekin kabhi basket karte nahin dekha <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Man, be the same forever. Good luck for MS. Kabhi hamare hitech flat mai tashreef lana <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Din ki shuruwat ek ? se aur end bhi ek ? se hoti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Do saal saath reh kar aur do saal alag reh kar bhi mujhe ye samajh nahin aaya ki questions puchne mai kya maza hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. well jokes apart apni apni capacity hoti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>We were roommates for the first two years in iiit. Both of us had different interst and goals. He was more into studies and mai away from studies. I remember in the first month of ragging i used to come very late in the night from OBH and without any hesitation he used to open the door. <br><br>Ek baar ka mujhe yaad hai jab maine isse koi doubt batane se mana kar diya aur fir thodi der baad mujhe bahut dukh hua ki i was rude to him. After a while I came back to room and said sorry peeping my head from half open door. You should have seen him kya kya bura nahi bola isne mujhe. Ek baar ko to mujhe bhi apne aap pe doubt sa hone laga <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Lekin kya karta his questions vary from "body lotion kahan lagate hai" to "Visa and passport mai difference kya hota hai". But onething to learn from this is that he had a passion to learn anything new he comes across.<br><br>He was regular at football. Anyone can identify him in the field with his distinct chadda (bumchum ka). He played for the batch in some of the events. But I don't know y has he stopped playing it now.<br><br>He is very sincere and hardworking. Very rarely it happened that he slept earlier to me in the night. We had very good understanding between each other. We hardly fought each other on something. I will never forget those moments when we used to take up a random topic before sleep, mostly kota ki yaadein and laugh like hell. You are supportive and have understanding but still one advice to you, don't be dependent on others for every small thing.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I know him since ragging days. Shayad hi koi aisa senior raha ho ga jo isse aur ye unhe nahin jaanta ho ga. He had maintained relations with everyone in our batch and also college. He possess good communication skills. I always wonder how he maintains acads with so much of BC.<br>GHEB raha ho ya fir LTRC Lab ho ya fir iski wing ho.. harsh ka sikka chalta hai..  <br><br>Harsh you had been so great to us for all these years, your contribution in all the batch activities whether it is felicity or fresher party or festivals, it has been tremendous.<br><br>Congrats for your recent achievements. I was quite sure of you and karan. Tum interview phod doge. <br><br>Best of luck for future and haan hume bhuliyo mat...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mota bhai dil ka saaf aur emotions se bhara hua hai. He is too sentimental sorta guy. He is very caring and helpful. Kitni hi BC karalo. <br><br>I was impressed by his simplicity, politeness and his creativity which is well reflected in posters of both the felicities.<br><br>I was very happy with his placement as he was the opener of our batch in placements. I remember the moment when he came to hostel with offer in hand and we all welcomed him with shoes, chappals and what not <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Man be the same for ever. aur haan mujhe bhuliyo mat vaise bhi hyd mai hi rehna hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Cultural Captain, Apex body, virtual felicity coordinator and above all Speaker of the parliament. This man has taken up all possible responsibilities in IIIT. <br><br>Yearbook is incomplete for me without his testimonial. We know each other since day 0. We were ragged together couple of times. I still remember the night when bopanna had ragged us together and the chasing dogs incident.  This was the first time we came across each other. Wo mahabharat, the most memorable day in first year.  Us raat hi iski sills ka idea lag gaya tha.<br><br>You have given a lot of strength to Karan in felicity and became a source of motivation in different times. His contribution is not just physical but moral as well.<br><br>If there is one thing to learn from him then it is PR, public relations. Man you have a good future in MBA. Look forward to it.<br><br>Bhuliyo mat mujhe.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Everyone's perception about other have changed with time but this man still carries the same image as it was on the first day. He is a genuine personality. He talks simple and straight with no ambiguity.<br><br>In the initial days of committee formation, i didn't expect that you and randeep will turn out so effective in placements as both of you already had microsoft PPOs in hand. You have proved your commitment towards the batch.<br><br>I have njoyed working together in placements. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>k for karan, k for kamiyabi. Shayad hi kisi kaam mai isne kadam rakha ho aur kamyabi nahin mili ho, whether it is felicity'09 ho ya IIMs ho.<br><br>First year mai isko padte, workspace mai code karte, time table set karte ya fir class mai concentration se baith te dekha hai. But second year onwards he had changed a lot, his focus was more on organising events, Managing stuffs, BC, CAT, sports etc, which made him an allrounder. Finally in 3rd year becomes the felicity coordinator. <br><br>His dedication and efforts in felicity was worth appreciating. I openly claim that it was the best felicity so far and with least number of controversies.<br><br>Unforgettable moments:<br>First speech in Motorola, contesting for the post of cultural rep. Bridging the divide of north and south.<br>3rd night of felicity, when his tears rolled out in happiness. <br>Networks informal tute during placements in your room.<br>Dinner in Vizag at your home.<br>Night we decided the felicity coordinator with tons of discussion, in my room.<br>SCP case and your escape through Jawahar's laws.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sambhavjain.html>Sambhav Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I don't deny one claiming other to be the all rounder. I respect their views too. But this personality is the captain of all rounders. 9 pointer, researcher, smart, gamer (bhale taash hi sahi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), sketching, actor, sporty, adventurist, good speaker etc. There is hardly any domain where he lacks.<br><br>I still clearly remember introducing himself to Sangal Sir in workspace on the first day of iiit.<br>It was only sambhav whom i can recollect among the 50 stood there. It is quite evident from this incident that Sambhav makes his presence wherever he stands.<br><br>His contribution in felicity was worth appreciating. He has been active in all possible college affairs. he is polite, honest, trustworthy and sometimes diplomatic which is essential at times. <br><br>He joined us for the Sikkim Trip and made it a memorable one. He has a good understanding and deals every individual in different style so as the individual feels comfortable. <br><br>Hume kahin bhul mat jana is checktronix ki nayi duniya mai.. Hope you grow within the company.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=yvsandeep.html>Sandeep Y V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman Sandeep. My first project partner in IIIT. We were partners in ITWS3. One reason for which I had a good time in my third semester is this person. We shared a very good understanding between us. He is very kind hearted, very polite in nature.<br><br>During Placements I was amazed to see you getting shortlisted twice on the first day and with your recent achievements of IIM calls and a good offer in hand has inspired me a lot. It was because of his company I came close to ranga, shiva and others who were residents of his wing. <br>@Shiva your testi is due...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He was my wing partner in first two years and had a good time together. Whatever little telugu i know is because of him.<br><br>I can very clearly remember when we were to choose ece placement lead, my first choice was prateek. Initially he refused to work for Committee as he had other commitments like CAT and I admire that after he joined the committee he worked selflessly.<br><br>His dedication towards placements had motivated all of us in the team. Ofcourse Adi, randeep and Sambhav too. He is a true soul of honesty, truth and trust. It was pleasure working with him for last 8 months in placements. <br><br>His contribution in felicity was also worth noticing. I have seen him working hard to road to success of felicity'09. <br><br>Onething which really inspires me is his 'no compromise' nature. He had options to opt for teaching or switching to cse jobs but he was determined to get a job of his choice and not the choice by circumstances.<br><br>I bow you for all the things mentioned above.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In my first year it was just hi hello with him but in second year while organizing batch trip we came to know each other well. He is nice, helpful and friendly chap. We have a good understanding between each other.<br><br>Onething funny to note is that I have taken few placement sessions for him but I an quite sure it must have helped him in building confidence. I still remember the way you jumped and hugged outside the interview room after you were offered a Senior Lecturer post in LPU. It was a most memorable day for you.<br><br>Good wished for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>A journey from Pcom to yahoo.com <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Maruti's life has been divided in to two distinct halves of its stay in IIIT.<br><br>Maruti 1: Careless, playful, immature, gamer, childish, fun loving, 6 pointer, thin and skinny, hacking, Pcom etc.<br><br>Maruti 2: Very Serious about studies, lost interest in gaming, became lot more mature, 8 pointer, put on weight, from Pcom to Yahoo.com.<br><br>I personally enjoyed Maruti 1. He was a man who ran after his interest and always wanted to make his position by his works. He started orkut hacking because of which he has innumerous Orkut fans. For every technical problem in first year, people used to rush to him and he used to solve them in no time. But there was a drastic change in him in second year for good, which finally landed him in Yahoo. Lekin firse dheere dheere apne purane andaz mai aa raha hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>good wished for your future dude...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Samay badla, room badla, frnds badle, badla sara jahan lekin bhaiyon ye kabhi nahin badla. Aaj bhi vaise hi ____ hai jaisa pehle din tha. I mean smart.<br><br>We know each other for last 8 years now. In first and second year we have shared a lot of time together. Almost shared our hearts out. Iski sabse badi khubi ye hai ki koi baat chhupane ke kitni hi koshish karle, nahin chhup sakti. Dil ki baat zuban pe aajati hai. Kai baar to banda ache se ache joke par bhi expressionless ho jata hai. Dil ka bahut acha hai. First and second year pass mujhe issi ne karaya hai. Kuch uplabdhiyan iske padane se jo maine hasil kari wo arz hai. DBMS padaya dikka aaya, CO padaya Cikka aaya, C padaya cikka - aaya, Maths padaya B- aaya aur jab kuch nahin padaya 3rd year mai to 9 pointer banaya. Well jokes apart doston, ye nahin hota to aaj mai first year mai hi atka hota.<br><br>College se vidayi ka mausam hai, khushiyon ko dukh mai tabdeel hote dekh raha hun... arz kya hai.. daat chahata hun sabki.. isse acha dost khuabon mai bhi nahin sochta hun. Raman is gareeb naacheese ko kabhi apne se door na karna <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...<br><br>Once in second year I got to visit his home for lunch in Jaipur. Just to save 5 Rs of petrol he dropped me to the nearest bus stop and asked me to go by local transport in rajasthan ki may ki garmi mai.  Acha bartav kiya dost, yaad rahega <img src=Smileys/10.gif />/<br><br>I sometimes realize tere second floor pe hone se apna interaction kam ho gaya. Best moment yuktahar mai dinner karte hue BC karna.<br><br>Dude now we are towards the end of a golden era. I have cherished every moment with you. Be the same. Good luck for your MS.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akshaysaad.html>Akshay Saad</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hamari shuruwat hui AGE se and end bhi shayad AGE se ho ga... lekin is AGE to AGE ki journey mai we have traversed so far off the road and explored each other a lot. He is one of the finest gamers of our batch. And above that even if I lose all the games against him i would still love to play more and more with him. There was a time when we together as a team never lost against atul's team for a year. But now Atul too has improved a lot, fir bhi thoda halka padta hai mere aage <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>One thing which I would always remember is his cunning smile with which he would tease the opponent even after winning continuously for 10 matches. The opponent gets frustrated and gives up eg Mks.<br><br>He is all time ready for Dominos, AGE and outing. One will always enjoy his company. One thing I never like about him is his carelessness towards placements. I kep motivating him to study for placements but he never bothered so. But finally he is placed with a decent package and that too in Hyd. Count++. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One and only one, DJ Ranga. Absolutely exclusive qualities he possesses. I have never seen him angry or unhappy during my stay in IIIT. He makes whole wing laugh, I mean hostel, with his quick and witted jokes. He is on spot singer and a walking dictionary of films, songs, directors etc. I came close to him only after our maiden journey to kerala. It was a wonderful trip, wonderful becuase of our beloved ranga, who sang non-stop from Munnar-Periyar. <br><br>Ranga, it has been a wonderful journey of 4 years with you. I am happy that you have stood with me for every decision I have taken. We have shared every moment of happiness. Few things which make you stand apart from the crowd in your jolly and selfless nature. Be the same for ever. <br><br>I had done the count++ when you were placed in Hyderabad for our next adventure trip <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Recently vig-sanket ki kitaab mai ek naya panna juda, bastar ka... A travelling freak. Still wonders whether you were really pissed off that day or not.<br><br>Friends this man is a hidden jewel. He loves travelling, reading and experimenting new things in life. I have tested him many times and he has always stood right. Everytime i visited his room i used to find a different set of books on his table ranging from Harry Potter to learn Java but never caught him reading them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Vig se ek hi cheese zuban pe aati hai.. and that is vig dairy. Served whole cellar with his dairy service. Jaise koi iska room to public ho. Multiple keys thi iske taale ki, sabko ek ek deke rakhi thi.<br>Some of the best moments I have spent with you is while modifying kalkote's AI codes and submitting it just before deadline, kulbir ka achar and yuktahar ke paranthe as lunch in your room, Trip to kerala, Sikkim and Bastar.<br><br>Iska apna ek andaz hai mere maze lene ka and to be honest I have always njoyed it. Mujhe issi mai khushi milti hia ki isko santushti mili <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>A very hard working, disciplined, trustworthy, honest etc. Always ready to help. Man I really feel lucky to be in Hyderabad as you too is here. we will make every weekend a memorable one.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I never had much interaction with this girl but I don't know, when i sat to write a testimonial for her, quite number incidents came to my mind. Some of them which actually touched me were:- <br><br>Hamari shuruwat aise hui.. It was our first month in IIIT and we were coding in workspace, I mean she was coding mai to aise hi, mujhe coding kahan aati hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She asked me some doubt and then I asked her rank and got impressed by it. <br><br>Ek baar, maths ki scripts dikhai jaa rahi thi. I scored least 8/20 and was much depressed but still as a CR i stood up on the stage and kept distributing sheets to others. I wasn't comfortable that night as my performance in examz were not up to the expectations and had of lot pressure on me from all sides whether it is parents or jawahar's scp case or CR work or any other. After the session I went to mess. Some time later at 9 I got a call from someone saying that TAs have called you soon they want you to order all the scripts based on roll numbers else you would be given F. First year tha didn't have much understanding about the grading policy. I left from the middle of the dinner and went to the venue. It was a frustrating job. There I saw navatha moving downstairs. She casually asked me where are you going. I told her about the phone call. This was the time when i needed support but didn't expect help coming from this corner. She said I will help you out and me, navatha and harsha together arranged all the scripts. I know you must have forgotten it by now. But i still feel as if it was last night.<br><br>She is honest, hardworking, trustworthy, friendly, inteligent. I had a myth that a girl cannot be a captain of the house as she has to every time deal with boys and entry to NBH is not possible. But she proved it false. I have seen her dedication for the house. Sitting late hours and preparing students for the contest. This is why in prithvi house i had no objection of shravanti heading cultural.<br><br>Thats all i want to say and yes thanks for all those proxies in music class <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhinav Parashar, tak tak tak, Umra 19 saal, tak tak tak, Gaon Deeg, tak tak tak, Career Point Rank 1,  tak tak tak, All Kota open test Rank 1, tak tak tak, Narayana Rank 1, newspaper mai bhi bada sa naam chhapa tha, AIR 149. Ek saal tak Kota mai sirf Abhinav parashar ka naam suna tha lekin shakal nahin dekhi thi. Fir ek din 18th July,05 achanak mess mai kisi ne bataya meet abhinav parashar. It was like dream come true. But he was quite reserve in the early days and i still remember when i used to meet him in NBH mess and ask him to mingle up with others. In my first semester i very often visited 3rd floor to see Pankaj and just say hi to him. Jab hum aapas mai ghulne lage to pata chala isse ek mirgi se bhi bada rog hai and wo hai chaay mania. Ek time to aisa ho gaya ki he pulled my shirt so badly in order to drag me to Coffee shop that I lost my temper. Then I started leofying him saying " yaar tu mera room knock kardiya kar mai darwaze ke niche se chaar rupaye fak diya karunga aur mere naam ki chaay kharid ke pi liyo" lekin bhagwan ke liye mujhe maaf karde. Lekin fir room se coffee shop and coffee shop se room ke janjal mai aise fase ki bas aajtak inka pichha nahi chhuta. <br>Jab tak hum 5th semester pahunche we had come very close to each other. We almost shared all our secrets to each other. Ittafak se, iske kuch kota ke kuch khaas frnd hamare common frnd nikale <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . bas aise hi samay nikalta raha aur fir aaya placements. . We had spent hours together preparing for placements. Tab maine ise ache se jana. He is very helping in nature, trustworthy, feel good gesture, optimistic, smart, and laborious. Man I know I could not do justice to you as there is much more to write about you.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Alok bhai pranam... hum sabke param pujya pitamah. Umra mai sabse bade aur inke baalon ki bhi gadna (counting) ki jaa sakti hai... <br><br>2 saal se dekhta raha.. Alok knock knock (NBH 50)karta and kabra ke baare mai puchta aur fir chala jata. Mai usse humesha ye hi request karta rehta ki kabhi mujhe bhi pada diyo and he was like haan haan zarur, aaja ichaa anusar. Fir sixth semester mai we took same course, DDBMS. He made all of us pass the course. Har midsems ke pehle padana, code issi ke dikhana naam badal ke, assignemts issi ke chaapna. Aur fir jab se issne padana shuru kiya, meri cg 6 se 7 ho gayi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I became a 9 pointer. Kaash tune first year mai padaya hota! That was the time we came close to each other. Tab se aaj ka din hai. Alok se din mai ek baar bina mile kuch adhura sa lagta hai. Isko dekh ke ek alag si hi energy aati hai. Naam se hi ek taza tarang si chhutti ho. To be very true mere liye ek parchhai hi kaafi hai. I stand by what i say. <br><br>He is soft, calm, cooperative, humble, true, genuine, confident etc. You are one in millions. There are infinite moments that i have cherished with you. Some among those are BC at mushroom rock, riding whole night from college to nampally to secunderabad to paradise in the hunt of food and finally pure hyderabad mai ek omelet wala mila. And above that it was during our placement season. I will miss your company as you will leave for blr soon. Bas iss chhoti si naa cheese ko kabhi bhul mat jana <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ...<br><br>Yaar shayad zyada taarif kardi lekin emotions mai beh gaya tha, could not resist...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nautiyal becomes Nauty. Conventional to Contemporary.<br><br>I came in contact with him in my second year when mathur used to be his room-partner. It took me lot of time to understand this soul as he always enjoyed his privacy. He had some priorities with which he had come to college. One among those priorities was to make his parents proud of him. With time our bonding grew stronger. Later when we had shifted to OBH, fortunately nauty got a room adjacent to me. It was time for placements and alok, paro, atul, nauty and me prepared hard for placements and hoped that we all get in one company someday. Lekin paro and atul 7.5 lakh ka haath maar gaye <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and rest of us had to satisfy ourselves with lower packages. But it was again fortunate that both of them are posted in Hyderabad. After placements I got to visit his town close to Dehradun. He is from a simple and educated family. There he told me about his struggle days when he used to daily up down one and half hours to dehradun for IIT coaching. Later he dropped the idea of going for coaching and prepared on his own and finally landed here in IIIT securing 346 AIR.<br><br>One thing for which I have always teased him is that he doesn't know how to ride a bike. These days he is taking lessons from me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bhai jaldi se seekhle warna usko kaise ghumayega <img src=Smileys/4.gif />... some of the yaadgar tips we had together are of kerala and UK (utrakhand).<br><br>Best wishes for your life after college.. and yes take a bigger flat.. we will come in dozens on weekends to blr and stay there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Jaat waali koi baat hi nahin, bas ek haryanvi tone zarur hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. I can still remember in my first year when you had to suffer in scp case because of me, somewhere in my heart still feel guilty for it. I was very happy when I heard you have scored ACE in c. <br>I can hardly ever recall him saying 'no' to anyone. You can always ask him for help and he will never refuse. He was the first one to take up placement tute proposal for the batch. Chand is lucky to have you as his room-mate. <br><br>This guy is sincere, sensitive, mature, friendly, helpful and what not... the list is endless dude... I mean by saying that you are an ideal friend, which one would dream off.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mks,<br>My wingmate for the first two years, made the whole wing lively. A religious chap, who prays twice a day and is pure at heart. He never cares of what others would think and simply blabs out anything that comes to his mind. Very careless, never carries his wallat and mobile with him. I can still remember the day well when he first time carried his mobile with him and got it pick pocketed in 216 bus. Mohit and him made my half the day. I used to hang around in their room most of the time and gossip hours together. There was a phase in first year when every afternoon he used to call up Idea customer care center and start asking all possible and irrelevant questions to the lady and make fun out of it. Poor her, had to answer to questions like, I feel cold when i talk on phone, what do i do?<br><br>It was fun playing AGE with him. I just cannot count how many nights spent together playing AGE. If somebody wants to see him serious then catch him playing AGE against Akshay. Once he gave me a look with big red eyes, three crease over the forehead, full tensed, biting lips reason being akshay in my team <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br>There are countless more things to mention, may be some other time. <br>I am lucky to have a friend like you.
