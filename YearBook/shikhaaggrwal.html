<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Again forgot... she hails from Bathinda and when I told her I lived there as a kid for 1 year, she seemed to be happy, which I had expected but curiously asked the reason for which she said that she doesn't meet many people from Bathinda... she said we were city buddies! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Oh I forgot about the Google and IIMs... so what's your pick? Really a phodu student !! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The only thing I remember about her for first 3 years of my college is her voice, which has been, time and again, resonated by others in a much more shrilly tone.<br>Yeah, she likes to talk, reminds me of Kareena Kapoor of Jab We Met.<br>She's quite a nice girl, we've had some pleasant conversation.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Thanks shikha for the 'unexpected' 'wonderful' 'emotional' 'funny' testimonial... It's good to hear that you missed your lunch for this, but i have missed plenty of lunch and dinners working out things that you have mentioned. But the appreciation from all sides make me forget all those pains for a while.<br><br>Shikha is one among the two north indian girls who joined IIIT in our batch. Before I joined the college I had already figured out Shikha punjabi in the list of would be IIITians'05. <br><br>First year ki baat hai, in CO Lab Test I was sitting next to her and asked her to help me out. She said okay but when test started she had turned her monitor otherside and refused to show. I somehow made two codes, one gives an out as 1 and other gives an output 0, I made TA fool and got full number in the lab test. And she was still struggling with the code. I told her softly 'lage raho mai chalta hun' sarcastically. But now i realise after four years that she is helpful just that she didn't want to screw in grades. <br><br>She is childish, fun loving, and charming girl. She is a bundle of dedication and determination which is quite visible from her performance in placements and CAT score. <br><br>Iske saath aap kabhi bore nahin ho sakte, ghanto tak baith ke BC kar sakte ho. She has endless things to say. she has a very cute smile which makes me hang for a while and say 'hi' to her even when I am in hurry.<br><br>Have a good time ahead. Its good that you are in hyd. Will have second part of the story in corporate life.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>SHIKHA - One of the most intelligent student in our batch.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Job in Google and getting through CAT (written) proves that. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Since I am a bit shy, we do not used to talk much in first three years of our college life.<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> But in fourth year because of our common friends (mostly ece guys) we came closer and become a good friend. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>And I became aware of a few more qualities of her after becoming her friend. She loves fighting <img src=Smileys/13.gif />.... not the physical one .. but the verbal one <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.. And if she and Khurana are sitting together anywhere on this earth .. you can witness it yourself. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br>She is a frank personality and speak out whatever she feels about you with ease. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>But since she is a girl, she can't digest secrets .. <br>I truly hate girls for that <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br>In spite of all this, we have become good friends and we used to ping each other(almost daily) on gtalk in a last few days of our college life.<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Wish you a great success ahead!!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>CHEERS!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Shikha, my classmate</b> both in Bansal's, Kota and in IIIT. At that time I knew her as the girl with the peculiar high-pitched voice. Times have come and gone, aawaaz vahi rahi, but the girl preparing for IIT-JEE and coming to classes in IL School, Kota is going to be one of the select few people who get to join google. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Although I've known her for seven years, the major part of our interaction happened in the 4th year, in Bipin Sir's courses and in Yuktahaar mess. It's fun pulling her and Shashank's legs over any arbit small issue, and the two of them look so good together. In classes she comes across as this hard-working, no-nonsense girl, whose hard work shows in the presentations she gives.<br><br>One incidence about her that I would recall any time I think about her. After it was clear that she'll get a very good score in CAT, I congratulated her and said to her that she would be feeling very happy. To that she replied that she wasn't very happy, since the success in CAT had come without hard work. It took me some time to appreciate the statement. It really speaks volumes about you, Shikha. Keep the same spirit always and I'm sure you'll do great in life.<br><br><b>Memories:</b> Appearing together for Yahoo and BoA interviews.<br><b>10 years down the line I see you as:</b> A high-flying techie at an astronomical level in the IT industry, Shashank's better half.<br><br><b>Tags:</b> Bansal, girls, Google, Yuktahaar.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Again a testimonail from BigB<br>She is cute , bubbly, chirpy. She has a squeaking voice. I fondly call her Chuchu, has an intersting etymology. I had a great time with her in the first year. The whole "Chand Chand Chand..." thing was damn hilarious.<br>She is damn intelligent. Phodu in acads! Waah.. ma'am bhi gazab hai ... bina jyada pade CAT phod diya and interview ke liye nain gayi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>She perhaps has the best resume in the batch, among the batch toppers, TA for all the major courses list is endless. And finally she is in Google.<br>I remember how unsatisfied she was after her first sem performance and she showed her determination in the following sems.<br>I had some really memorable experiences with her, "when I accidently pushed you off the swing<br>in Shilparamam, when you were cheering me up in the Bus because I was angry with you, making fun of your pony tail, disturbing you in the class,the Rakhi time and the long walks we had,the fun we had in Felicity'07, the Rangoli we made together in the recent felicity and won a consolation prize". Chuchu has set goals and she is very dedicated. She likes to try things and explore new domains, she is a good dancer, very creative. We were in the same english group and I was amazed how she used to poetically write<br>things. <br>She was brilliant in the Felicity, she managed threads pretty well and how can I forget rally against Global Warming, fab work. I will remember all the scolding sessions, I have scolded her over little things and then we used to make up for it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I remember our recent chat during placement, it was truly amazing! We were discussing "what will we do if we are not placed".<br>We have seldom talked after second year, but we have a special bond.<br><br>You will always be special to me!<br><br>All the best aage ke liye...<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Shikha aka Chuchu</u><br><br>Shikha, my cute little sister in IIIT (though age mein badi hai but dekhne mein to chhoti hi lagti hai na <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I never liked her much in our first sem or so, I can discreetly remember I-Day in our first year when I thought that she was quite haughty, as she and Prashasti were shushing us first years coz somebody had asked them to do so. Later on as time flew by and we get to know each other more, I realised that she wasnt so haughty after all.<br><br>The stories of her bondness could go on to fill volumes and yet they wouldnt be exhausted 9 Pointer, Intern in MS, Job in Google, 5 IIM calls, and pata nahin kis kis subect mein TA. Phew.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Main kahan, "Is even sky the limit??" . When it comes to studies, she and I are poles apart, she is the sincere student, always cribbing about assignments. She even enjoys studying <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif />  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I mean how can you do that?? Even in 8th sem after being placed in Google, she is sincere abuot her assignments <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We almost invariably bonded over the 27 hour long bi-annual train journeys to Delhi we have undertaken all through our B.Tech, the train trips used to be so much fun, me & Pk teasing her, all 3 of us fighting for the window seat. Wish we could do it once more <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Our relation has always been full of crests and troughs since the time she tied a rakhi on my hand for the first time. We would have VERY long BC sessions at times which would span for hours on end and then again, there would be months on end when we wouldnt talk at all, or even see each other once. Its been a very different story altogether. There have been some reasons which have ensured that things remained this way and will remain the same, so both of us have learnt to take it in our stride. And whwnever we meet, its always so much fun teasing her, giving a pat on her head ;D I sooo luv doing it!! Mast maza ata hai.. chidhane mein aise <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><u>[Part 2]</u></b><br><br>One incident which I will always remember is the first time she came to know that I smoked. It was sometime in 4th sem or so, I guess. She was shocked beyond belief at the prospect of me. I still remember she made me promise that I wont smoke again, but I being the intelligent fellow crossed my fingers and the result is known to everybody <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But now she has grown used to the fact that I wont leave it, to zyada chein-pein nahin karti and chup chap se rehti even if I do it in front of her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Its been real pleasure knowing you, waise to I know you will decide your future yourself, but anyways All the Best!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Most Memorable Moment : would be all the train trips we had, they were just plain Awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>An advice : Dont dare forget the promise you made that day in front of DLF of finding a girl for me in Google<br></b><br><br>Cheers!!

We have taken several crazy career-related decisions together in the past (more craziness was on my part) and went back on them. We were never sure what to do, but anyway tried several things with enthusiasm. Had she not been there, it would have been a very heavy, monotonous life in B.Tech. Without her help I wouldn't have arrived at the final decision. She has supported me all the way, good times, bad times.<br><br>Best wishes... and always 'be' there...</b></i></ul><br><br>

Soch raha hoon kafi time se kya likhon: only so much can words say <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> However, lets make a start.<br><br>part 1<br><br>Let me start by saying: shikha apni shikha se sabko khush kar dete hai. She has loads of energy, talks with infinite enthusiasm. There is no dull moment when she is around. She is a fun-loving girl. Meri saari baatein, saari problems, sab sunte hai.<br><br>Needless to say, she is brilliant. It often happens that she asks me to explain something or solve a problem for her. While I think of the possible solution/explanation, she would come up with her own in a matter of minutes, surprising me. She is the one who attends every lecture on time and prepares notes. There have been some hard subjects/topics...par ham library mein ghanto bhaite rehte, kaise bhi dheere-dheere kar lete.<br><br>Pakar-pakar bahut karte hai. Bandi ko iske liye award diya jaa sakta hai. Par ek baat jaroor kahoonga, agar chup ho jati hai tu man nahi lagta <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Padh ke shayad aur pakar na karne lage). Tension bhi kabhi-kabar le leti hai. Exam mein, interview mein thoda tense ho jati thi par ab theek hai.<br><br>Bahut jaldi kise se dosti ho jati hai - saari baatein sunti hai aur saari bata bhi dete hai. Kai ladke interested hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Na zaane kahan kahan se kab kab pyaar bhare sms bhejte rehtein hain <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br><br>IIIT mein kafi achievements kamayein hain. Google, Microsoft, IIM interview calls, parliament member, pata nahi kya kya. Par shikha wahi hai jo 1st year mein aaye thi - who used to sit beside me.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Shikha .. the only punjabi girl I have seen in my college. But I don't know if she knows Punjabi or not <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> never seen her talking in punjabi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>She is one of the few girls in the campus to whom I have talked and I really enjoy talking to her. She is very frank and talking to her is gr8 fun. I always use to tease her about one thing or the other and frustrate her. But she starts crying at the end <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>She is really good at studies ... placed in Google and got 5 IIM calls .. so I think its enough <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and that explains everything about her intelligence. <br><br>In first year we went to Ramoji Film city and we enjoyed alot there. I can remember a couple of other outings where she accompanied us. She is really good at heart and won't let u feel bored while she is along. <br><br>The most unforgettable thing is the chat we had in Summer holidays ... where she got another name 'bandar' ... and after that we use to laugh <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> when ever we saw each other. Yuktahar is the best spot for her BC sessions .. you can always find her doing BC and hardly having her food in Yuktahar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>At the end, I can say that .. she is very sweet and very talkative <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Always be the way you are. As u are in Hyderabad .. same as me .. so be in touch and Best of Luck for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
