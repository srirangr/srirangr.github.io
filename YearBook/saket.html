<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>This guy is a total chatting freak. At any time you visit him in his room in an isolated corner of OBH, he'll be busy chatting with around 20 girls of half a dozen nationalities. The countries he has his girlfriends in, beats my Geography. Also, a total movie and sitcom freak. You name a movie/ sitcom, and he has seen it. Also, a ferevish maggie eater and a fellow drinker and ....<br><br>Ganje se meri dosti 2nd sem mein Khatri aur Saurabh ke saath hui. Second year mein hum log bahut saath mein rahe. Ser, that was a very good time, when we ALL were together. Pata nahi ki tujhe realize hua ya nahi, par tere alag rehne ke decision se hamaare group mein se bahut kuchh kam ho gaya. Zindagi mein aur bahut kuchh jud jaata. We were all your friends, but for some reason you chose a faster net connection over us. All the same, I respect your decision. You must have given some thought to it.<br><br>I'll always wish that you live your life well. Any time you wanna do something on your own, or any time you wanna come forward to make a promise, I'll try to do my best for you. May God bless!<br><br><b>Memories:</b> The time spent in your and Saraswat's shared room.<br><b>Tags:</b> Group.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If I had to count three weirdos in the batch, Saket's name will be right up there. He is always lost in his own world; watching sitcoms and chatting with arbit foreigners without as much as a rat's ass to the rest of the world. I wonder whether he ever bothers about his life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>His room was the play practise adda for Aakash house in the first year. Back then, he was hilarious as the yoga master <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We used to hang out a lot in my wing, courtesy Khatri and Saurabh. Poor Ganja (One of the three in the batch) was always the guy getting leofied <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I still wonder of thats one of the reasons why he lives along in the ground floor now!<br><br>All the very best in life!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Has to be all the play practices in your room. </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Saket the Ganja .... bahut hi ..quite and shy type ka parsan hai .. lekin jab oblta hai...pate ki baat bolta hai..aajkal ..facebook mein time waste karta hai..!! <br><br>Banda cool hai ..and chalne ka style bilkul alag sa hai iska ...bhai...mast rah ...and ...aage badha ... pahle ganja padhta tha ...ab pata nahi kya ho gaya ..alag sa hi rahta hai ye .. <br><br>Bhai thodi logo se khul mil ...<br><br>Chal enjoy ...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Saket, one of the few GanjaS of our batch <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . First year Yoga hall wali meeting mein main iske pass baitha tha. He was IIT 2000 somthing ranker. I thought he will be among BONDS of the batch but then First year mein A4 mein tha, tab se samajh mein aa gya tha iske agle 4 saal ke planz i.e. 24*7 no studies, only BC. Sayad hi kabhi class mein assignment kar ke aata tha, yaad bhi nahin rehta tha ladke ko <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Class mein hamesha sota rehta hain , I always use to wonder how can sleep like that in class <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> But flash ka fan hain tab se, always trying something new with that. He is the one who thought me how to chat. Although mujhe boring lagne laga but he still carries on doing that , and that to with videshi galz. Facebook walon ne toh ek baar block bhi kar diya hain for using extra resources <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Is big fan of TV serials, hamesha sayad chatting ya sitcoms hi dekhte rehta hain yeh. I can say he is cool (but yaar itna cool <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Best of luck dude for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
