<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My ITWS III partner, lol he seems to have had a real bad time with me in that project, sorry buddy lekin main aisa hi hoon. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>His earliest memories were our days in GHEB when he used to stay in my room between classes, and sometimes doze off in my bed or even Atul's bed, <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> so that he doesn't have to climb three floors for just a couple of hours.<br>He has never liked my sense of humor. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and said, "Scientist, phatte mat maar." <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Next thing I remember about him was gaming as his hobby.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Contd.</i><br><br>But beyond all these quirks, I know Mathur as a very friendly guy. Kitni bhi mar lo iski, banda kabhi dil se bura nahi maanta. Iske matlab yehi hai ki banda samajh jaata hai ki saamne wala hurt karne ke liye nahi mar raha. Maybe isiliye sab jageh iski dosti hai. TT aur CZ ka deewana. Khelta bhi mast hai. Iske saath kai bar ghar gaya hoon train mein, aur Ajmer mein bhi saath ghoome hain. Lagta hai ki bilkul hi timepass banda hoga, par LTRC mein MS bhi kar raha hai. Badhiya!<br><br>Lagey raho Mathura. Apan to milte hi rahenge. Yahaan vahaan kaheen bhi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> All the best for your life! <br><br><b>Memories:</b> The train journies, scuffle, bumps <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><br>Banda 6-foot lamba hai, aur mere jitna patla hai. The most flatchested guy I've ever see, but fir bhi thodi si tond nikili hui thi bande ki ek time pe atleast. Poora safed aur transparent complexion hai, aur zaraa sa joke mar do, ya kuchh kar do to banda literally poora lal peela ho jaata hai. <br><br>Bande ki  ungaliyaan itni lambi hain ki banda ek ungli mein poora glass pakad sakta hai. A mangy stubble around the mouth is all that he grows for a beard. Chashme ko naak pe thoda sa slide kara ke, uske oopar se dekhta hai, aur daant nikaal ke hehe kar ke hasta hai. Ek chutiki sabzi ke saath 6 rotiyaan kha leta hai, ghee aur cheeni laga laga ke...<br><br>Ab mujhe itna hi pata hai, baaki iski girlfriend jaane <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but I guess I can safely say that based on physical characteristics alone, he's the strangest person I have ever come across.  <br><br>Ab ye to sab oopar ki baatein hain... jahaan bhi kaheen kisi ko bumps pad rahe ho, to banda pahuch jaata hai aur uski ma behen sab ek kar deta hai. You would think that he's getting paid to kick that poor ass <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br>Aur agar koi isko bumps dene ki koshish kare, to gusse ke maare laal peela ho ke kursi utha leta hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>Banda poora heera hai. Ab aur kya bataayein... ladai mat kar lena isse, baal vaal kheech ke ganja kar dega tumhe <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>... Aur agar kabhi 3 ke group mein se 2 ko police wale ne pakad ke loot liya, to us loot ke paise ye teesre se bhi nikalwayega. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Par banda hai mast. Kabhi kabhi iska dimaag satak jaata hai to public place pe gaali dena start kar sakta hai... bina parwah kiye ki paas mein kaise log khade hain... <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br><i>contd.</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mathur aka laal-peela <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The most bindaas guy of our group. Bhai banda MS kar raha hai lekin saale ko kabhi kaam karte hue nahi dekha <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bag lekar ghoomta hai lekin usme bhi bas 1 mouse, taki moka milne par kahi bhi CS khelna chalu ho jaaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Sitcoms, movies, CS, TT aur BC yahi iski life hai. He is the second Tinka of our batch. Hamesha kahi na kahi ghoomta mil jaega. Easily mingles with almost every group and one of the friendliest guys around. Got to know him when he became a part of our group. Most of our interaction took place initially while taking meals. He was one of my Yuktahaar buddies. Me,Pappu,Mota and Budhdha had a lot of fun leofying him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> during those meals in yuktahaar. <br>One of his peculiarities is the way he turns red now and then. Girgit ki tarah rang badalta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bhai ko hamesha lagta hai ki iska kat raha hai, pata nahi kyu <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Tension na liya kar yaar, tera koi nahi kaat sakta mathure. A total nocturnal and has one of the most wierdest sleeping times. Quite good at playing TT and a bond when it comes to CS. A decent dancer(Vayu ka heera <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), though haven't seen him doing that for a long time. One of the leanest fellow in our batch who has made lots of futile attempts to gain some mass but all of no use <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Always has a cute smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and lightens the atmosphere around him. Isko dekhkar kabhi serious hone ki feel hi nahi aati <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>Some memories associated with him are - all those meals in Yuktahaar leofying you <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, playing basketball in 2nd year, Goa trip in Dec'07, preparing for SE(role-play part <img src=Smileys/24.gif />) and EPP presentation, the booze party given by juniors when you cried <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> and said some senti things to me, the volleyball match near CS when you got totally frustrated on losing <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and then pulled everyone's cheek and a lot more.<br><br>All in all he is one of my good friends in IIIT and really pure at heart.<br><br>All the best for your MS bro. God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The Mathursss, apun kaa yuktahaar ka sathi is one of the guys whom I like very very much (except on a few occasions). Kabhi kabhi ispe bohot zyada laad aata, patlu saa hai aur zara mein laal ho jaata hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Irrespective of the fact that he takes bath or not, he is most of the times neat n clean. I remember knowing him through Raman (they used to play TT together). Also I was a big reason for his inclusion in TB as I was very fond of him from the beginning <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In the workspace too, I used to work on his PC. He is that chill kinda fellow who mingles around nicely with people and is not very demanding. He can be seen  hanging around at almost all places in the college, be it CZ,TT, TV room, yuktahaar, LTRC lab, playing cards, cricket in morning, etc. <br><br>We have done many a things together - hunt for DJ sponsors that was real unsuccessful fun, editing music for dance pieces <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> yuktahaar meals, home journeys, mere paison se teri treat at Barista <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , ISB bike trip, ES1 night out with Somani,etc. You, me, Raman and Vipul form a deadly combo for some solid BC jo main bohot enjoy karta hun <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Is bande ko hamesha lagta rehta hai kee duniya iska kaat rahi hai aur ye hamesha satark rehta hai.

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mathura is one of my good friends in IIIT.<br>I see him as a person who socialises with every one. You can find him doing BC in the first floor and second floor. He is there in everyone's birthday, he hardly misses any outings. I remember, in the third year he used to stay in the third floor and we were in second but he hardly went to his room. We had<br>endless BC sessions then. For the people, he is among the best when it comes to TT, he is<br>among the best gamers in the batch. We have particpated in many Felicity events and won also <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br>I call him "laal chipkali". He turns red even if you shout at him, if you hit him hard<br>the whole body gets red, I remember Himank scratching him with a comb and the mark remained for a hell lot of time and when we pulled his cheeks hard his lips were as if somebody kissed him, aah! the funny part was he had to attend a marriage after that. He is very short temepered. I remember, how angry he was in Ganja's room. But, he has reduced a lot. He is a kid at heart, had some really weird fundas about friends which I don't really think he really believes in. For me he has been a Chotta bhai types. I still remember the scuffle incident and when the juniors got agressive at him and the series of events after that. He has been more than helpful at times. The sweetest part was, he would buy stuffs to eat for the night out which he would share with none, but he never refused me. Whenever I was hungry at night I would go to his room. He is not what many take him as, he is a person who really trusts his friends and this motherfucker never really accepts that. He is a very different person when he is drunk, had some really personal talks after that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>Some Memories- All the late night brunches, chai stalls visits, getting you red, TT matches in first year, Cache In, Club 8 visits, T***I incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, late night BCs in the wing, "Oye light chale gayi oye", talks we had after we were high. You are a great friend. Thanks for being there bhai.

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Hyper </b> active banda hain, you  can always find him arnd for BC, masti and any game u want to play. He is the reason y most of us play CZ nowadays. He is very good in CZ, I guess best among us <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Another game I enjoy playing with him is cards, banda aisi bewkofi karta hain, ki u just laugh <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> He is damn cool and friendly <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Streethawk serial ke liye bahut roya hain , but finally he got them I guess,is fan of movies and serials, hamesha DC mein bhi BC karta rehta hain. Some of his comments makes to laugh like anything. Laal badi jaldi ho jaata hain, kewal choone se hi lal ho jaata hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, Bball khelta tha pehle, but being in Vayu kabhi zyada mehnat karne ki zaroorat nahin padi <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, OBH cricket mein fodu hain although field ekdum faltoo hain but batting awesome karta hain.  Dance bhi karta hain, I remember you fresher dance, where you were in middle, surrounded by other Vayuites. TT khelta samay kafee serious rehta hain, us samay zyada BC achchi nahin lagti ise, Kul milake yeh din bhar idhar-udhar khelta rehta hain ya fir kuch dekhta rehta hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> vaise toh LTRC mein hain but abhi tak paper nahin hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Hope you will complete MS at the earliest(humare jaane ke baad kuch kaam bhi kar lena <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br>When we shifted to OBH, he got a room on 3rd floor and we got on 2nd floor. So, he became a pseudo-wingie as he used to remain in our wing for most of the time. Then in 4th year, he again became my wingie again and it was fun to be a wingie with him again. Hamara downloader yahi ban gaya. Main to bas pen drive le aata idhar udhar se aur har cheez isi se lekar jata. Khud kabhi download nahi karta. DC par aisa kuch nahi hota jo isne na dekha ho. Bande ki movies dekhne ki kya speed hai. 10 min mein poori movie khatam. Fir jab movie discuss karo to ise kuch pata nahi rehta usmein <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Iske room par har time koi na koi TV series ya video chalta hi rehta hai ya fir ye CS khel raha hota hai. We irritate him a lot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Main, Maroo, bhalu aur buddha milkar iski roz chop karte hain. Ek baar to ye Bangalore ya Chennai mein tha, tab humne iski chop karke ise message kiya ki teri chop ho gayi hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Ise utha kar paani bharne le jaate hain chahe iski bottle full hi kyun na ho <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Iske room ki light to jaati hi rehti hai (light gayi oye, light gayi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Once, me, Chand and Bhalu were at his room and he just started Bomarillu for time paas, but then we insisted on watching the whole movie and he had to bear a nightout when he didn't want to. Banda TT awesome khelta hai and I really like playing TT with him as I have learnt a lot in that game from him. Then this guy introduced me to the CS and the elite CS group ... thanks a lot for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hyper awesome CS khelta hai. But snow mein Hyper ko sabse jyada kaun maarta hai ?? - novirus, aur kaun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Iske laal hone ke to kisse kaafi popular hain hi. Koi kisi doosre par chillaye, tab bhi ye banda laal ho jata hai. Aur, bhalu ko to ise laal karne mein maza aata hi hai. At last, I would like to say that this guy is a very good friend of mine. Hope he completes his research as soon as possible. Best wishes for ur future pal. Keep in touch for sure. Weekends par to vaise bhi apan log saath mein honge hi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>(Continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1<br>Mathur aka fjords aka Hyper aka TK aka girgit aka tinka .......<br><br>Is tinke ki first year se hi har jagah udte rehne ki aadat hai .... har jagah, har kahin kisi bhi group ke saath kuch na kuch khelte ya bc karte dikh jata hai. A very active person I must say. Har jagah apna katvata rehta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I got to know him in second year when he shifted to NBH in my wing. Before he shifted to our wing, I used to know him as a guy jo har jagah har ek ke b'day par peet ta hua aur pit ta hua dikh jata tha. When he shifted to our wing, I started interacting with him. Equitypulse ke time humne khoob bc ki thi. Chand ke naam par kitne hi accounts banaye the (chand, chandc, chandch, chandchu etc <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) . At that time, I found this guy intelligent but careless. aur ye baat mujhe ITWS project ke time par pata chali jab isne project Sainani ke saath liya tha. He made that site quite beautiful and professional and I liked the kind of things he did in that site including search and highlighting searched things and many more. Us time par ye mujhe kamina lagta tha. But asli Mathur tab saamne aaya when he allowed naughty to become his roomie. Naughtie wanted to shift to NBH and Mathur had no roommate. Then I thought, agar koi banda single occupancy se double occupancy tak mein jane ko raazi ho jaye to vo kameena nahi ho sakta. But I don't know why he tries to portray himself as a kameena when he is not. He is actually a good guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Most of my interactions with Mathur have taken place in the wing, and its been fun with him around. Reason: the way we leofy him. There is this habit we (Himank, Vipul, Manish and me). One of us says, "Vande mataram", the others "Jay Mata di" etc, and his gets "cut" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We even called him up to inform him about it once <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . The problem with him is ki use hamesha lagta hai uska kat raha hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Well it is true in some cases, for example his project in LTRC! <br><br>Sambhav is known as tinka, but he can be rechristened as it as well. He can never stay for too much time at a particular place, and is one of those persons who hangs out in every wing. And he loves it.. Mixes very easily with people. His interests are varied, which allow him to do so.. CS, F1, BC etc. We share an interest in F1 and Kimi Raikonnen, and its fun discussing the same with him. I really hope Brawn gets kicked in their arse next time around mate!<br><br>He is one of the most active guys around. He also certainly the most nocturnal guy ever. He has wierd sleep timings.. You never know when hes going to sleep and when he'll be awake. Besides, he loves a drink and having a good time with his friends. However, hes been avoiding boozing for some time now, for a lot of reasons <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All in all, a fun chap and a good wingie <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . May God bless!<br><br><b>Character he represents: Thomsons from Tintin comics<br>Fav memory: Tera kaatna <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Message for him: Be more confident about yourself. </b><br><br>Peace.<br><br><br><br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Mathur aka mathura aka girgit aka TK is a perfect blend of kameenapan and innocence. When he gets down to kameenapan, no one can beat him. But he has this other side of him and that is he is very childish and innocent. This was recognized very late by me. He is very good to some people and never do anything against them. I feel very happy to belong to that elite group of people. A very good TT player and a CS freak.<br>I first met him on the very first day of college. He was sitting there in 119 with his father. First glimpse of him and you could judge he is very simple, down to earth and seedha saadha, chhota sa bachha. Though some days later he started showing his true colors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Since we both were from Rajasthan, his father suggested that we should take rooms together but he was sorted in Vayu house and I in Aakash, so that was not possible. He was alloted a room in GHEB and I got one in NBH. Due to this the interaction level was very less. I can remember his workspace PC was quite good and mine was totally sucked up. So I often used his to watch movies and do assignments. But frankly speaking, uska first impression to chutiye wala tha aur wo abhi tak kuch khaas change bhi nahin hua hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Later in second year he shifted to NBH but that too on 2nd floor. But he used to come to cellar and that's when we actually became friends and interacted with each other. Then I realised his true talents and for me his image sort of started changing. He stayed alone in NBH room when we all had to stay with partners. This made me very jealous of him. Jab bhi ghar se aata tha, mast naashta leke aata tha. His homemade cakes are just awesome. In 2nd year summers, we both took a project in LTRC and he was my partner and was quite hardworking. I must admit here that he is very good at coding and I just did the debugging and thinking part. I used to explain things to him and he just coded them nicely. He is good at studies but quite careless and never studies. You can always find him moving from one room to another in his peculiar style. <br>Then when we shifetd to OBH, he got a room on the 3rd floor when everyone else was on 2nd floor. But this didn't stopped him from coming down and he was a kind of pseudo wingmate because most of the time you could find him in our wing. Internet freak, net disconnect ho jaye isse bardaasht nahin hota. He was the prime reason we all planned to go for Goa trip which was one of the best experiences of my life. We had a  blast there and enjoyed it to the fullest. He did something there which really pissed me off and I could not even bear a sight of him for some days. This was because I didn't know him properly at that time and so could not understand his behaviour but now its all fine and happy between us. <br>In the 4th year, he finally shifted to my wing and his one more passion came into highlight. The passion of watching each and everything that's been put up on DC. He do not leave a single video on DC unwatched. Whenever you go to his room, you can find him watching some video and that too forward kar karke. Downloading ka bhi bada shauk hai. He always keeps on downloading something or the other stuff from net and then boasts about the same.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>His testimonial would not be complete without mentioning his colour changing ability <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. This is why he has been awarded with the "Human Chameleon" award, also famous as "Laal Tamaatar" because of the same. He just goes red time to time. Once when Chand was shouting in the wing, he was sleeping inside his room and he became all red with fear <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. You just rub a finger anywhere on his body and it looks like a birth mark for some days. He is one of the most friendly person in our batch. He talks to everyone and is friends with so many people. Its very easy to irritate him. You should see him when Himank irritates him.<br><br><b> Most memorable moment </b> would be fight between him and Maruti in 329 <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, project phase in 2nd and 3rd year.<br><br>Good luck for your MS. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Mathur</u><br>Mathura aka Mathure aka Mathuri aka TK aka lal tamatar!  Names galore for this freakishly thin vagabond who keeps turning red on every little thing. The earliest memories of him would be of the guy who had quite a nice config wala system in first year and the asshole was in my row ,making me go green with envy so many times when he would be seeing a movie on his system while even the lug moderators had given up trying to run mplayer on my shit of a system.<br>Later on I remember Mathur as a guy who was present in each and every b'day party whether it be NBH, GHEB, coffee shop, always there to kick some friendly ass <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Most probably that is how we must have become friends, mostly how he gains all his friends.. by going and talking to every freaking person. He is friendly with each and every person, must be one of those rare people in batch jo kahin bhi ja ke kisi bhi group ke sath kitni bhi der bc kar sakta hai.<br><br>Then in second year mathur came to NBH where he shifted to the 1st floor in the same wing as chand, adi, manish, vibhav. That must be the time, I guess 3rd or the 4th semester when me and him became close friends, usse pehle tak he was more of a time pass frnd.<br><br>I dont remember if it was the summer holidays after 2nd year or it was 5th sem and we were just having one of those walks, which more often than not were organised for the purpose of me going out to have a sutta (and those were pre-activa days). We were talking something about me and some girl, then mathur said something of the effect <i>"tujhse to main kuch chhupata hi nahin hun"</u>, I can still remember how glad I felt that day to hear this statement from him. The most important and valued thing in a friendship is trust and I was so glad that he finds me friend enough to trust me with his secrets. Ofcourse he has always been the person who hesitated the least (and hence my most frequent company) whenever I asked him to go out for a sutta <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Somehow the vagabond'ness' in him made him the person always eager to roam around.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Then come 3rd year, when we all shifted to OBH, he (unfortunately) got stuck on the 3rd floor while all of us got rooms on 2nd floor, he being alone in his wing and that too a floor above us. One of the valid consequence of this qould have been, he staying in his room as it was very rare that we went above to meet him. But instead, he became what is now known as Pseudo-Wingmate!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It was as if, he started living in our wing instead of his. You could either see him in Vipul's room, both of them doing some BC in the name of doing their honours project or in Chand's room doing some arbit BC with him, in my room reading my chat conversations or else in the wing agar general BC chal rahi hogi.<br><br>How can I forget all the BC we had in our wing, sabse awesome was <i>"Mathur ki chop hona"</i>, me, Manish, Maroo n Vipul would come together and say somthing like "Vande Matram" or sumthing like a slogan and then wont let Mathur say anything and as a result uski chop ho jati thi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We once did his chop when he wasnt even in hostel, phir usko msg kiya "Teri chop ho gayi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />" then once, the same happened in Cog Sci class, then again he was duly informed by a message. In the beginning he used to try, but tab uska munh band kar diya jata tha.. so later he just gave up <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I dont think anybody in our group can ever forget the booze party we had in mathur's room back in 3rd year, when he ate all that maggi masala when there was nothing in his hand or the childhood secret he told us which got him the famous nick "tk" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I think that one among the very first times he drank with us and after the incidents of that night, he never really could muster enough courage to drink to tulluness after that night (ofcourse I will leave yest out of this <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) there must be many more secrets which he is afraid of people knowing about <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ofcourse, the most awesome thing about him is the lal tamatar one, he is one of the most allergic person. Anything under the sun can make him go red, it can be heat, cold, dust or you pulling his cheeks, even somebody shouting at somebody else can make him go red. And I so love him going red can never have enough of it, thats why keep pulling his cheeks. Two of the most memorable incidents in this regard would be first , the chennai incident, I once pulled his cheeks so hard that it became purple and he had to go to his cousin's marriage.. I am pretty sure there must hav been many questions from his family as to the source of the mark <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. To add to his misery, it looked like a love bite <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> the mark was still there when he came back from Chennai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The other incident was when I ran a comb on his hand, the hand obviously went red but for a few hours, his hand was like furrows with clear depressions in his hand coz of the comb <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ROFL!! ROFL moment that was <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I just have one sort of qualm with him, even after saying that he would tell me anything in his life, he never told me much!! I dunno if I moved away or sumthing but frankly I never think that, unlike other people my friendship level with him never decrease... it was always increasing, if anything. Or may be he is the most uninteresting person in whose life nothing happens, I rather doubt if he shares with anybody for that matter. I have at times felt that he doesnt open up much. Another thing with him is, you never seen him sad, he could be either happy or angry but never sad at all, pata nahin bhai kaise manage karta hai. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Many people term me as the irritating one but the amount of irritation i have meted out to other people is nowhere near no of times I have irritated this guy, almost every night when vipul n maroo are asleep and he,me, chand and manish (the late sleepers) would be doing BC in their room. I will go to his room and pakaofy him, at times I would take his bottle and pour water on him, kick him, pull his hair and what not!! And to think of it, this has been going on for 1 year without this guy complaining once <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Awesome man.. I have had so much fun on your expense. Thanks for all the entertainment <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I guess his claim of being benefited from JV came into fore here... He always claims that his anger has calmed down a lot since attending JV.. I dunno, I never even listened to JV. Another aspect of him is the TV show and movie junkie that he is. I always comment <i>"Aisa ho hi nahin sakta ki mathur ke room pe kuch video na chal raha ho",</i> its like whenever you go to his room ya to koi movie nahin to show or else a music video kuch to hamesha chal hi raha hota hai. I think the thirst of his socializing isn't satisfied even after being with people almost all the time, he wants more people in his life <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And the only times that he is not watching any movie or anything, he would be playing CZ either on the LAN or with bots, quite a CZ addict the guy is.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If there is a count of the no of memories which you have with a person then this guy would be definitely be at the top for me. I must have the most memories with him. I wrote a whole testi about the incidents and still there are lots more left. Almost all my nights would be peppered with memories of Mathur. Almost every night something or the memorable would happen, i will laugh for 5 mins with a frustrated mathur looking at me and it is only then that I would come back. Hey man thanks for providing me with all those wonderful moments. Talking of memories, I will always remember how, mathur was always the last one to be intimated when we were going out and that too when evrybody else was ready, forcing him to come running, while other people were cursing him.... Will seriously miss the outings if there is no mathur coming down running, tucking his shirt in the pant. Will say that meri raatein to ekdum <i>berang </i> ho jayengi mathur ke bina <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. The memories will not cease coming to my mind, I guess the onus is on me to stop writing now!<br><br><b>Award for him : New super hero <i>"The Human Chameleon"</i> in Heroes<br>Fav Moment : Either vo comb wala nahin to vo gaal ke nishan wala<br>Song for him : Idhar Chala main udhar chala<br></b><br><br><i>Just one thing to say to you!!<br>Yaaron.... dosti badi hi haseen</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
