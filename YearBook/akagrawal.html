<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Adi aka Alsi aka Bond aka Wikipedia</u><br><br>I have seen many Bonds since coming to IIIT, and have been a fan of different attributes in different people, but the first person who I started considering Bond in IIIT was Adi. He was the proverbial bond with his matured n sophisticated demeanor. No random BC, apne kam se kam rakhna. Not the exact definition of outgoing guy, you wouldnt find him doin BC with random people who he doesnt know too well. This was one of the reason, why we didnt gell well. We never talked too much, one of the reason was that both of us being lazy and our rooms were 2 floors apart, which meant almost no coming to each other's room. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Another quality of him is, he is the quintessential gentleman, spohisticated, suave, fine grained, you can keep on listing such qualities and they wouldnt be sufficient to describe him. Thats why it was more than fitting that he would be the guy who would work closely with our dear GAG, who stresses a lot of gentleman like behaviour. He has stood the test of time when it comes to being the gentleman, whenever all of us would be <b>machaing</b>, he would be standing in a corner observing us. You would never have seen him <b>leofying</b> anybody ever. <br><br>Another very important facet of his character being his laziness, he was the first person whose laziness was discovered (later on Raman & Me were also added to the group). Never has there been an outing where we  don't have to wait for him. I think even the girls would fade away when you compare the time taken to get ready into account. This guy taked atleast an hour to get ready whenever we have to go anywhere and hence has been at the recieving end of many curses from people.<br><br>Since time is in short supply, will try to be a bit concise <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>Our real gelling factor has been Booze, everybody remembers the time when he wouldnt let Vibhav sleep in his room when he would come after a booze session but later on he became one of the biggest bewda of the batch. Since the time he started drinking both of us have been a constant feature in any booze outing we have ever had, its rare that you see us missing from the scene if Booze is the buzzword <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We have had some pretty good conversations after booze, I still remember once in NBH, he told me a few secrets which he had never told anybody and to date, those secrets are preserved deep within my heart <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I fondly remember that after all those sessions we would tell each other that its only while drinking that we talk and should start talking a bit more but would always fail miserably in the effort and our conversation would be postponed to the next booze party <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Ofcourse his work during Placement season is commendable, Nobody ever thought that this guy would put so much effort and work his arse off for placement, but he made us all eat our words. His work during the placement season was exemplary <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Kudos to you!! I will always remember the day I had my interview with NVidia, this guy took me to their office as the cab provided by them had to go. Not only did he drop me there but when I came out after giving my interview, he was outside waiting for me <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Luv you for the concern you showed that day <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I wasnt in the best of my shape, wasnt even able to speak up, was dead tired having eaten nothing after the bfast, almost 12 hours of tension coupled with nothing in my stomach. I am pretty sure, had you not been there that day, waiting for me. That would have been the longest journey I ever undertook <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>Then came M$ internship, which definitely redefined our relationship, the 4 months spent there were just wonderful. The fun that the three of us had there was just incomparabale, I can never expect to have so much ever again in Coorporate life, we almost made mockery of the boring tag associated with Job and had a truly great time. I will always cherish those times with great fondness wherever I go <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Will always remember all those games of Pool, TT & FOOSBALL which we had in Microsoft, all the times we would stay there till 11 in the night just so that we could play a bit more <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All those times when we would stop at the Ice Cream wala just so that I could have my sutta <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  This was the time, when courtesy you, I developed a taste for Limca which I still persist with <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the times you would come to my cube to do BC. All the times you made Manish & Me wait and we couldnt do anything except cursing you. All the times laughing at the <b>Watermelon</b> laughing at the name of the guy who used to sit beside me, I hope u remember the name <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the trips back home on my Activa. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> N definitely the most memorable thing in the whole 4 month period would be <b>Pasta</b>, from Bohemia. I think we must have had the same thing almost 60-70% of the lunches we had in MS <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> For sure Bohemia must have gained a lot from our exploits <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> How can I forget all those IPL matches we saw in MS, watching the IPL final while having Cup Noodles or Checking out News every now and then when Indian Boxers were sweating it out in the Olympics <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Solving that maths quiz and comparing our scores after every few turns <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Working would be so dull not having you around. I dont think any of us will ever forget the MS party. One of the most memorable Booze party ever <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>Almost everybody knows how important maths and numbers are in my life, and in him I found a guy who would share with me the interest in numbers. He is one of the very few people who I deeply respect for their mastery over numbers <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and I think at times I have even spoken about this, when I am not in my senses. All these similar qualities which we posses (laziness, numbers, luv for booze) make me wonder why we didnt become good friends earlier, may be it was always meant to be so, destiny had this in store for us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The guy is a very generous heart, he has given innumerable parties to us. He would never think twice anytime you ask him to sponsor your ice cream or booze. Most of the times we go to Club 8, it would be him who would shell out the extra money from his pocket and almost invariably he would never get the money back. <br><br>There's a lot more I would have loved to write.. May be some other time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Wising you all the best for your future!!<br><br><b>Fav Memories : First would be the evening after my NVidia interview, All those times we boozed, All those times in MS<br>Song for you : Sala main to sahab ban gaya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> & Peene Walon ko peene ka bahana chahiye <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b><br>Cheers!! Keep boozing.. We gotta discover a lot of Pubs in Hyderabad <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Aditya means Sun. I was trying to relate it to his character. Let me take a try. Hmmm.<br>Sun is the source of light, Aditya is the source of knowledge. Sun might be decaying bit by bit, but his knowledge is only increasing day by day. Hey I got it alright. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I take this opportunity to thank Lord of Alcohols for scripting that fortune moment when we got talking after both of us were completely out. We talked and we talked some serious personal stuff that day. We knew each other, merely as acquintances. But after that chat we had, we knew we could be good friends. We had a chemistry. <br>He worships Microsoft daily. And I think he carries a passport size photo of Bill Gates in his wallet <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. The guy is crazy about MS products. And the hate for Apple products is very obvious here. But I think I have managed to help that fade a little. His fondness for cars is well known, he is a gadget freak. He gets into details of everything he lay his hands on. I mean he will see every option and controls available on the device, and before you know he would have already analayzed it. I share some of his passions and have learnt a lot from him. My knowledge was very superficial, it is even now, and I am still learning and he is always there. <br>I have very wonderful memories with him. The first one is obviously that chat, then the the walk we had in Goa where we went to a different shack. The girls there were amazing <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Then the numerous chat sessions and the long walks in and around the campus. The bike trips that we have had were amazing and I hope this wont end here. Still a lot of places to be seen and explored. There is one very good thing with him, whenever I say lets go to so and so place, he is almost always ready. Even if he is not ready, I convince him a little and there we go. I simply love his company. I have shared a lot of deep and dark secrets with him and I sincerely hope that he will keep them intact <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Time is the best teacher, he has changed a lot from what he was in first year. He has also become more confident of himself. He likes to take control of the situation. The spirit that he has shown in working during placement is commendable. Just like me, he suck when it comes to girls. He had a few very good chances but he screwed up big time. <br>I sincerely hope that we be together after college. God is great and our frienship is even better. Thanks for everything. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part I<br><br>Adi!<br><br>For the introduction, "We have always been good friends" this is what we always say to each other. I have many memories associated<br>with this guy. We were friends from the day one. He was my neighbour in First Year. Everyday after class I would come to his room. We used to have discussions on any random topic, be that the idea<br>of forming the group(still remember how much against you and Maroo were) He would everytime ask me to close the window fearing that he would catch cold and I would refuse. He is damn intelligent, walking wikipedia. Its difficult to argue with him because most of the times he is right. I follow a simple rule whatever Adi says, Is right. In the first year he was bit shy. Especially with girls. But, he has special corner for NIFT girls <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Adi had a standard dressing sense, you could always spot him in an orange formal shirt properly tucked. He is damn sophosticated. Its fun to hear when he speaks in English, bhai itne formal hote hain. And if you do a favour he would politely reply "Thank You". Aah, in first couple of year he and Maroo pressed everyone to speak in English, they both spoke to each other in English, but we never joined them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We have studied many subjects together right from the first to fourth,  be it Maths I or EPDS we always studied at the last moment. He is a lazy ass, we both. We had taken Human Desires course and we studied together, we had mugged the whole of wikipedia but during exam he did not write an answer to a question just because he was feeling lazy.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>Me and Adi had special affinity towards CG. I remember, in the first year we used to predict everyone's  CG. It was funny when we actually messaged everyone their CG.He is a great athlete, we both use to jog together in third year. I used<br>to stop early and he used to go till HCU. He is one of the best coders in the batch. He reads Cormen like a novel. Adi is the worst dancer I have come across. I remember, I was teaching him a very simple step and he couldn't even learn that step, finally I had to give up<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In the first year, I remember we were fighting for fun and I pushed him and got him hurt, during his Birthday when we all threw him up in the air and forgot to grab him back <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He has tickle-phobia. Even if you swirl your fingers he starts laughing.<br>Back in first year, when ever he had an issue with anyone he would come to my room and tell me the matter. He was the one who introduced me to rock(Thanks for that). I would ask him to send me the songs I should hear and he would give me a list of songs which I might like.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part III<br><br>I never imagined Adi would drink, infact he would become one of the biggest beweda. I remember in the Vizag trip, we were sharing the same room, I was bit drunk and this motherfucker did not allow me to come inside the room. I had to plead him to let myself in <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Me, Adi and Bhalu have been the most regular drinkers. Where there is booze there will atleast one of us. When Adi is drunk he never stops talking. We have boozed together uncountable times. First it was white mischief then it was beers. We had some of our best moments drinking together. Me and Adi have been TT partners as well, it is fun to watch him and Manish playing. Its like you are watching India and Pakistan playing a match. He doesn't beleive in leofying anyone. But gets leofied royally. The best part is he never gets irritated. He is the one who plans most of the group outings and that too all of a sudden. He is not a movie buff, but he likes all the Martin Scorcese flicks. I remember, Me you and Maroo came third in the Dumb C. Adi is a branded guy <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, he doesn't wear anything which is not branded. He only wears Levis, has a swiss watch. He is crazy about cars. Man! I still remember that Aston Martin we saw on our way to 36 jubilee hills, freaking awesome.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part IV<br><br>Adi worked his arse off for Felicity. He and Pagare wanted to make the Rock Show one of the biggest in the city. I remember, how we all landed on the name "RIders on the Storm". He was damn passionate about this event. He did A-Z for the event, we both got the sponsor. Aah! meeting with Anjani in the Irani Cafe was an interesting experience. You did a great job!  "Riders on the storm" was undoubtedly one the biggest rock gigs in the city.  Though Felicity '07 was not a very memorable event for both of us. I remember, he so wanted to host the event but he couldn't and how upset he was, I still feel guilty for that.<br>He has done a commendable job as a placement coordinator. "Everyone in the batch respects the amount of grit and determination you have shown".<br>during the placements. I remember, how upset he was when Microsoft did not take any one. He literally fought with the HR, once he also shouted at the Captal IQ HR. Seriously be, I bow to you for the work you have done. I still remember, the reaction of you and Maroo when I got placed. In all it has been a great journey with you Adi.<br><br>Some Memories- tickle-phobia, all the BC sessions we  had in NBH-146,148,OBH "Riders on the Storm", studying together and finally all the boozing sessions we had! We have always been good friends and it will always be like that.<br><br>Adi rocks!<br><br>Cheers!</b></i></ul><br><br>

Placement ke samay toh banga aur isne itna kaam kiya hain I just have to hug you guys for all the work you have done <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Handling Jayadev,calling companies, subah 4 baje uth kar 11 baje tak rehna .... seriously hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Although he super BOND of algorithms and DS, this guy had fucked his Google interview, by not telling them the answer of "What is BST?" He is crazy abt MS, always praises there products and will fight you if you dare to utter some bad things abt the company. He is among the ppl present after felicity 3rd night. The Coffee machine dope incident still make me laugh <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the three parties I had with him, he remains cool, listens your every point, correct you nicely if you are wrong , take care of you not matter you are OUT or not <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and listens rock. Haan rock ka bada fan hain, felicity ke samay you can how much excited he was on rock night.. moshing and headbanging that night was awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All the best dude for your future in MS, hope you will be VP of MS soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>It's quite weird that with all the people, who are getting BIGGER testimonials from me, I share a very short period of interaction ranging from a maximum of 1.5 to 1 year and Adi is one of them. He is one of those guyz for whom I would have never imagined that he will become my good friend ever but now he is one of my closest buddies here. If I have to describe him in one word it would definitely be Mr. Gentleman. For me he is an epitome of knowledge. Be it browsing, studying, playing, music he is exceptional at everything he do. This testimonial might look too much arbit and not very well composed but it hardly matters because I wanted to put my feelings and I hope I did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We never interacted in the first year. He was the first one to own a laptop in our group and this was the reason I once went to his room to actually see how a laptop looks like. I so desperatley wanted to use it once but so many people were already present there that I left silently. The year passed on without any talks at all. His initial impression on me was of a total geek and a proudy guy who is so proud of his achievements that he does not like to people who are not upto his level. this was also one of the reasons which kept me from talking to him.<br><br>Then when I became the part of TB, interactions started. But still it would not be kept under the category of good friendship. We used to go out and he was the one who always beared the responsibilty of placing the order. Quite sophisticated, I must admit though he lost some of his sophistication to me and now I'm a little more sophisticated than him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He was one of the "Big 5" who were the ones who always planned to go out and never thought of consulting anyone. This sometimes pissed me off and this became another reason why I kept refraining from talking to him much.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2a</b><br><br>Initially in the first two years, he was a vegetarian and a non drinker. He was totally against nonveg and booze. We both shared the same opinion about these two though I had much stronger opposition. But eventually he fell  into the "darkness" of both <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and I used to think what a person he is who cannot stand onto his principles. But later when I myself did the same thing, my whole perception changed.<br><br>Then the things turned up drastically after the Goa trip in 3rd year. I drank for the first time there and fell in love with it <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Since then, there had been a very few occasions when we drank and Adi was not there. A regular boozer who rarely says no to Club8 outings. He became our pseudo wing mate. You could always find him hanging in my room on weekends. I am so fond of shopping and he is a total shopping freak. You ask him for shopping and he will never let you down (though I lost a bet for this once <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> ). It's always fun to go shopping with him.<br><br>Now coming to his knowledge area, there are a very few things on this earth he doesn't know about. You just ask him something, he will give you atleast some information about it if not complete wikipedia. This is why we often call him "Mobile Wikipedia". his greteast passions include Rock music, cars and electronic gadgets. Initially when I heard him leistening to Rock music, I often wondered how can one listen to such a music and go head banging like freaks. He introduced me to rock and man now I understand why people are crazy about it. You name a car and he will tell you the biography of not only the car but also the company. His favourite pastime includes browsing and reading something or the other.<br><br>Contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2b</b><br><br>It was his sheer dedication that he got an intern in Microsoft and later got placed there too. He is one of the laziest guyz I have ever met (after Raman) but this perception also changed after I saw him work day and nite for the placements. His work as the placement coordinator was commendable. Hats off to you bro for all that dedication. Frankly speaking, I and may others never imagined he will be able to do that much work and were quite shocked when he was appointed as placement cood. But he proved all of us wrong. He is also the most careless guy one can see.<br><br>Contd...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>I have shared some fantastic moments with him and MS party is one of them. It is definitely the most memorable party I have ever been to. Recent Maiden gig in Bangalore will be another one of such memories. It was a one-of-a-kind experience for me and it was freaking awesome. He is very brand conscious and never buys any stuff that is not branded. This is one aspect which I also adopted from him.<br><br>Its been said that daroo brings people close and here is an example which proves this. I think its the booze that brought us close and he became one of my closest buddies. I will cherish so many of those booze sessions in my room and outside where he was present and we just spoke our hearts out when drunk. He is definitely one of my closest buddies here and I feel very comfortable in sharing somethings with him which I find sometimes difficult to with someone else. I often turn to him in help and he never lets me down. <br> <br><b>Most memorable moment</b> would be MS party, Maiden gig and those numerous booze sessions.<br><br>No need to say that we'll stay in touch because you are placed in Hyderabad itself. I'm sure you'll do great in future. I hope the things will not change after you'll leave college because it would be very hard for me if something like that happens.<br><br>God bless you.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>Some memories associated with you that I will cherish throughout my life are - The outings in 1st sem to Pizza Hut, Prasads,Koti,  endless BC sessions in NBH-47, movies on your lappy in 2nd sem, dance party in your wing in 2nd year, numerous tutes that you have taken in 2nd and 3rd year and during placements, Goa trip in Dec'07, booze session on 3rd night of Felicity'08 , club8 outings, all the help you have given me during placements and many more.<br><br>Wish you all the success in the future bro and hope all your dreams come true <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. <br>God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br><b>Fav.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Never seen him getting emotional, even after getting drunk and stays very balanced all the time. But then there is always the daroo exception. Drunk Adi is a lot different from the normal one. He has so much more to talk to, so much advice to give to others and is really great to hang out with. Will always remember all those valuable advice you gave me in club8 in March'09 (don't remember the date <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and hope to implement them in the next phase of my life.<br><br>Has very clear fundes in life and knows exactly what to do so as to acheive his target. Very few around here have such clarity in their thoughts about their future career as this guy has and I know that he will make it big someday. A total brainy and extremely good at acads. Sleeps half of the time while attending any lecture and still in the end understands everything (wonder how <img src=Smileys/7.gif />)  and even has some doubts to ask as well. Got intern and PPO in Microsoft which is indeed <br>a commendable feat <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Also to mention is his obsession for MS and its products.  Madly in love with cars (his wishlist tells the same) and travelling with him along the Banjara, Jubilee side one can see him spotting different brands of cars and discussing them with Ganja. <br><br>Though aalsi a lot of times, even when he knows ki iska katne wala hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But the dedication with which he worked as a placement coordinator clearly belies the 'Aalsi' phrase associated with him and most of us were really amazed to see him <br>working day and night during placements. This is for your great job as a placement coordinator <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .<br>Always there for his friends when they need him and help in the best possible way he can. Helped me a lot after my accident on last Holi. Thanx a ton for that and for everything else you have done for me in these four years <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Adi aka Aalsi. He is one of the first friends that I made in IIIT. Still remember the days of our first year when He, Maroo and me used to hang out together. Back then he was very shy and reserved but when he opened his mouth it was all gyaan and no bakwaas . BC was something unknown to him at that time. But these four years have changed him a lot in some aspects.<br> <br>One of his core qualities is his never ending thrust for knowledge. The 'Mobile Wikipedia' or 'Mr. I-Know-It-All' of our batch has that much gyaan in his brain which any single human can get inside him and still has that inquisitiveness to know more. Be it technology, politics, economics, sports or any other field he has something or the other to contribute to it. The most sophisticated guy of our batch , machaate hue kabhi nahi dikhega <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is a gentleman in the true sense.<br>But one thing where his sophistication somewhat vanishes is when he hears rock. An avid rock fan and one of those guys who has still kept the rock culture alive in our college. The first time I got a taste of rock was on the rock night of Felicity'06 and I was quite surprised to seem him going wild doing hand-banging. He introduced rock music to our group and me and Pappu used to play tracks from Metallica, Maiden, Sabbath, GNR in full blast in NBH-47 as suggested by him. Even attended some gigs with him in OFD, X-bar, Durgam Cheru which were really memorable. Worked with all his heart for Felicity'08 rock night and played a key role in making it the best rock night in Felicity ever <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>He is shy initially but once he opens up he is a totally different bloke. Quite mature and really thinks a lot about people. Even quite particular about noticing minute niceties of others from their dressing sense to their behaviour and habits. But this can sometimes be irritating as well for the one who is being targeted . </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In the end:<br>For me, he is one of my all time best friends in the world. This person is really someone who'll always be there for me, cheer me up, and inspire me.I can blindly trust him. His words and advices really mean a lot to me. I find him really very honest. I can look upto him whenever in need. I can share anything with him. I have really enjoyed all the time we have spent together here. I would have been completely different not just academically but in many other things like interest and probably behaviour as well if he wouldn't have been my friend (Thanks to God for not doing that). I look upto him as my idol (good GK, good English, very sharp, intelligent, sophisticated, down to earth, and what not). He is the guy whom I admire the most in whole IIIT and not just in our batch. I assure you that you can always count on me buddy. Thankfully, you are also in Hyd(the best part is, in the same company) and hence, I won't loose the best company I'm having for the past four years with whom I can enjoy, I can play, I can be senti, I can discuss anything under this world, I can ask any bloody idiot question I want to without any shame. Thanks for being a part of my life here.<br><br>I wish you all the luck for your future. I am confident that you'll reach skies in your career. Go and conquer the world, nobody can stop you. "Sky is the limit" is the correct phrase to be used for you. Be the same as you are because you are the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>But if you are Adi's neighbour, then you got to appreciate rock sooner or later and same is the case with me. We both got an intern in MS where I and Bhalu irritated him a lot. Adi and me made a foosball team as well and we started doing quite well in a few days time. (Hope to continue this after our joining (whenever it comes) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ). Then I got a PPO from MS and I was praying like anything for him also to get the same. Actually, right from the time of Shakti (as we did all our courses and projects together and we were such good friends), I always had a feeling that we'll end up getting a job in the same company which came true when the result for his PPI came affirmative. That is definitely amongst some of the happiest moments of my life. Then of course, late night TT sessions also come in some of the memorable moments. And yes, how can I forget to make a mention of MS party here <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> !<br><br>I also made a law about him by observing a few things sometimes, which says<br>"Whenever Adi gets an opportunity to screw up something, he always screws it up." <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>and the best example is CogSci Term Paper but thank God, that matter got resolved.<br><br>He is also obsessed with Microsoft products (especially LIVE), wikipedia and automobiles. He always tries to get result from live search and only in some special cases, goes to google. This guy is damn sharp and intelligent. He grasps things in a matter of seconds. He is an NTSE scholar. His IIT-JEE screnning rank was 128 which is an achievement in itself. This guy remains fully confident at whatever he does. A perfect gentleman he is. Most of the time, all you can do is admire him for the things he is and will be capable of achieving. I'm proud to have met him. <br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Our friendship grew stronger as time passed. When 3rd sem comes to my mind, Shakti (Beeja di Shakti <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) also comes with it. How can we forget how we made our group (Chand, Vibhav, him and me) by requesting our individual group members and arranging for them some other group members, how hard work we put in to create a simple line using QT, how we spent a whole night trying to find a small bug(variable name matches with some not so famous keyword of QT) in the code etc. This guy never takes tension. We had a discrete maths exam next morning. I was in the library and I knew that he hadn't studied till then(neither did he listen to classes as those were quite boring) and when I returned from the library, I found out that he was sleeping peacefully. We took most of the courses together when all other went for various other streams. We failed at most of the projects we tried to do because of some reason or the other. We took a project under Dr Kannan in second years summer but he wanted us to do something related to research. Whenever we used to go to him, he used to say read this, read that. We didn't find any output coming and hence, lost interest. Then we chose Dr Kishore for summer project which also failed because of his less interest( he asked us to come after 1 month when we went to him and then, we never went <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). He asked us in parallel algo class after nearly 3 months that we were doing some project under him and we were like, what to say now? Then we took a project under Dr Zulu in Compilers where we couldn't get much documentation on Trimaran and hence, we didn't do that as well. But thank God, we finally achieved some success in BTP <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. His testimonial can't be said to be complete without rock. Yes, he is a big fan of rock and he introduced that to most of us. In my first rock show at college, I was sitting in workspace playing Stickcricket as I found that all crap, very noisy and hence, irritating.<br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Maroo used to come to his room for asking doubts a few times and we used to ask him to do a few sit-ups to get his doubts solved <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Once, he even agreed to do that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He saw me crying (when I had an argument with chand at the end of the first sem) aur jab bhi kuch rone ki baat par discussion hota hai aur log bolte hain ki manish ko kabhi rote hue nahi dekha, to kamina har ek ko naach-2 kar batata hai . He also loves arguing and he took part for sometime in famous Maroo/Mridul discussion at NBH-146. I have written this line in Chand's testimonial as well - He and Chand are the two guys whom I can ask even the dumbest thing possible and they would definitely reply back instead of getting irritated or making fun of me.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Going back to the first year, I still remember my first day when we were sitting on a comp in library and he was playing snooker and chatting with some random girl from my newly made yahoo account where I spoiled the fun by telling him not to chat from my account as someone told me that chatting from library comp is not permitted and action might be taken if you do that (What an arbit notion it was ! <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Later I found out that he was my neighbour in the hostel and hence, I found one of my first best friends at IIIT. I came to know a lot about him in a few days time - an amazing guy with awesome general knowledge (our mobile wikipedia), very intelligent, wonderful knowledge of computers, very good English, sophisticated of course and very lazy. One example of his laziness is the Human Desires exam when after the exam he told me that he knew the answer but "aalas ki vajah se likhne ka mood nahi hua". Actually speaking, he is not that lazy but when he comes to laziness, he crosses all of the limits. If you ask him to come for lunch in mess and he says, "haan be, bas naha kar aata hun" .... bas fir to, you have to wait for atleast 40-45 minutes (aisa kya karta hai yaar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). An extremely helpful guy he is. His C-programming was/is very good and I got a lot of my programs debugged from him. For me, he was the labcom (I still feel that he should have been elected as the labcom because of his knowledge and helping nature. ). Whenever I had some doubt(I used to have a lot of those as computer was/is(acc to him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) a mystery box for me.). He only gave the names manish88_a@yahoo and manish88.a@gmail and created the accounts which I have been using till now and will be using in the future also. We (Vibhav, him and me) used to study together during exams in his room. Remember, how we used to laugh sometimes madly and that strangely happened always during exams. <br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If I say that I have spent 2 out of 4 years of my college life in his room, then that won't be much of an exaggeration.<br><br>I first saw this thin guy with specs wearing an ornage colour T shirt(as far as I remember) tucked into a jeans in workspace where our discussion group had to meet for the first time to give our introduction. The first image of him to me was - very studious and a bit show off (as his English and Gk were/are quite good) out of which first one is not completely true(studious but not very studious) but second one is absolutely false. One of my best buddies. I definitely owe my CGPA to him as it was he who used to solve most of my doubts.</b></i></ul><br><br>

But in 4th year when I shifted to his wing .. we had a lot of BC sessions in our wing .. or in any of the rooms .. the TT sessions were awesome.<br>This guy approaches anything that comes to his way with such an attitude that there is no way anything can stop him (other than his aalas <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) to accomplish that, which was evident when the PPO interview at MS was just a formality in his case. A 'Good-mix' of humble, geek, smart, confident and pool of knowledge. I am damn impressed by his knowledge about anything to everything .. a mobile wikipedia as we say <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>This guy has been stereotyped as aalsi in our group .. but the effort he has put in for the placements is more than commendable.

But when he has put his mind at something, he makes sure that he achieves it. Microsoft <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And yeah, he is a perfect gentleman. Machate wai kabhi nahi dikhega <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He is very inquisitive when it comes to the world, so much so that he has been given the name "Mobile <br>Wikipedia". In fact, any topic under the sky (Or above it), you can come down and discuss with him. Rest assured, he'll have a fair bit of knowledge about it. In fact, if I ever get selected in KBC, he'll be the first one in my "Phone a friend list" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>All of his attributes and qualities leave no doubt in my mind that he'll make it really big in life, he'll get the Porsche he wants and get the hottest chick.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 3</i></b><br><br>Let me start from the day we met. You remember it, do you? When I had come to your room and we hit off immediately. We discussed a plethora of issues, right from his 100 odd rank in screening to computers to football to ragging. Ragging, remember that day when I came to your room right after Jain screwed the hell put of me? I was in a torturous state, and came running into Adi's room and said, "Abe saalon ne mujhe chod diya". And lo! There were Khare and Joy standing in your room! That day, when they asked us to do the weirdest errands possible, I was in the comfort that you were there. Things would be alright <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Twenty days later, it was hilarious looking at you enacting out the 'dirty' versions of various personalities on the last day of ragging. Introvert. Shy. Thats how Adi is at the start. He <i>does</i> take time to open up. He took a lot of time to open up in the group. But once he does, well hes amazing. Didn't I already mention that?<br><br>Then there were the arguments and BC in your room with Chand and Manish. Pizza Hut treats with Chirag. Mangal Pandey with Khatri and Saket <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Aakash house skit preperations (He was brilliant as the Bengali babu. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) Those lengthy BCs about frustrations in life. BC about politics, and all the other issues. Discussing our careers. Opposing the formation of Trailblazers. The October marathon outing. Discussing the follies of daroo and the way we pledged staying away from it (Look at us now <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) . You consoling me whenever I felt sad or hurt. Studying in library. Batch trip '06. Doing OS assignments together. Night outs in the Felicity stage, playing <b>that</b> game. Singing like crazy on the roads of Hi-tech city. Chats in the first year holidays. Your idea of creating the Marathe M'am fan club.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 2</i></b><br><br>Well, let me also tell you the reason behind that status message of mine. I had an altercation with two of my closest friends, Adi and Pagare back then. And I was at fault. It was also my fault, that I could not understand the hurt which my closest friend felt.. My lack of understanding of his sensibilities, in spite of spending nearly all my time with him. One of the few, but very crucial altercations we had.<br><br>I often feel bad that we lost it. He was my best mate in the first year. We spent <i>all</i> of our free time together. Most of the time, I would be hanging out in his room. I'd tell him my deepest feelings, share my best moments, cry over my problems like I have never done with <b>anyone</b>. We would laugh together, help each other, leofy people and have a blast! I share some of the most amazing memories with him...<br><br>Memory, what a fascinating thing. I mean I can just close my eyes and travel back in time. But the burn about memory is that you cannot change things in time. Looking at things which you liked is good, but there are also the memories you dont feel good about. You can just travel back and look at them. Come what may, you cannot change them. And that makes it all the more painful. Its hurts you all the more when the effect is carried on over time.<br><br>How I wish I could change some of those memories.. Some of those moments. Those which brought such a good thing to an end. But then, hasn't someone said that all good things must come to an end? In such a situation, I will (again) remember something which he himself had told me. "Lets forget all our issues, and revel in those good memories". To the good memories, mate. :cheers:<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i>Part 1</i></b><br><br>Here is the first testimonial I had ever written for Aditya,<br><br><i>" An awesome friend n a very down to earth guy.. dis is what I have to say about Adi. Dis whiz kid from Benaras provides gr8 intellectual company.. he's got brains to match!! Can be shy at first.. but can be a gr88 friend once he opens up. Wish u all the success in life dude.. n may our friendship last " </i><br><br>Lots of things in the testimonial which still hold. Some which don't. One thing to note, is the whiz kid part. He is one of those (few) guys who came here knowing that he wanted to be a comp sci grad, a clarity for the priorities in life at a very early age. And unless things change dramatically, hes going to stick around to this chosen line of career. How many of us had such crystal clear priorities back then?<br><br>In fact, Adi's views are <i>crystal clear</i> in most of the aspects of life and the things around him. He takes his time, does a lot of thinking, but has a clear, reasoned out response to every situation or question which is thrown at him. And this ability, to put emotions aside, think logically and clearly is amazing. The hallmark of a true engineer! Be it the elections, friendship, career, relationships, job.. This ability to think in a lucid manner makes him stand out in a crowd.<br><br>"Balance is the most important thing in life", was my status message one day. (This was in the first year). Adi immediately buzzed back saying, yes it was. Personally, I've seen very few people who are more balanced in life. And thats the attribute in him which leads to the clarity of thought and deed. If there is an issue to discuss rationally, hes the man!<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 2</i><br><br><b>Have been in a few </b>unforgettable incidences with him. The horribly tense moments during the Indian Ocean (mis)management <img src=Smileys/13.gif />, One night after Felicity when we were on a different plane and I saw a totally Kameena-type side (not at all) of him (still lol at that one as I write it <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), and today at the polling booth, where we both saw some sections of the society together which we do not normally interact with <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> These moments, in one way of the other, will always stay close to me.<br><br>He's one of the few people who have exactly the kind of work they want to do for a long time to come. He's sure about his ideological leanings, and knows enough of culture to appreciate the finer points of life, and has a sharp analytical mind to handle it all. Comes from a good background and is very soft-spoken and suave person. Overall a very well-rounded personality. Cheers and all the best for life! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1:</i><br><br><b>He is a gentleman. </b>Very sophisticated guy. He was the first guy I talked to in IIIT when we were standing in a never-ending queue outside BLN's office. He told me he'd got 100 something rank in Screening, and I was like, wow, This guy sure is smart! And he later very quickly went on to prove his smartness in the very few next days.<br><br>Of course the smartness and sophistication are still there, but a lot of things have changed over these years. I told these guys in the very first few days and I could tell that he was horrified. Bad decision, that was. But look at him now! Became a HUGE rock fan in the third year. Couldn't in my imagination have associated hard rock and drinks with him in the first year. <br><br>In the fourth year, we saw a different side of Adi, when after getting placed in his dream company, he took over the responsibility of placements and not just managed them, but also gave tutes and all. The stand on rock seems to have softened too, with him listening more of the softer variations these days. I think he's consciously worked hard on his personality and must say that ultimately reached a good balance.<br><br><b>In the third year,</b> I disagreed with his commitment to the TOTAL ROCK lifestyle, HRL, encouraging moshing, seeing it as a sign of success of the rock show and so on, but in general I've found that our views match a lot. Both like reading random stuff, have views about India, take interest in politics and have similar political leanings. Maybe these things will make us see more of each other, especially since we'll both likely stay in Hyderabad for the next period of our lives.<br><br><i>contd.</i></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>' E-maculate Gentleman ' is the phrase which comes to the mind when I think of Adi these days. He has been a substantial influence in my college life, more so in the first half. We got an opportunity to know each other during Fresher's skit prep. where I played an Arabian and he was a Bengali Babu( very funny he was). He was there with me in Aakash house and A-1 English group as well. I instantly disliked him because he answered a lot in class and was very comfortable with PC jargon and programming. I was none of it. Plus he used to wear those full sleave shirts and trousers most of the times to the class which <br> made me think - okay, not my kinda fellow. Not to say the least, he had similar kind of notion about me as well <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> By the time TB happened, we were cool buddies who used to attend English classes together and have dinner together. After TB, we spent more and more time together and were becoming extremely comfortable with each other. We had many discussions but academics was never the one (coz I had nothing to say there <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) I remember we going for Felicity '06 sponsorships to atleast 10 jewellery shops but all in vain. Finally, some lady at a random watch shop entertained us <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Come Felicity '06 Rock show and it was the nastiest thing I had seen <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And this chap was just head-banging away to glory while me and Maroo were sitting on the sofa and cursing the proceedings. That was my first stint with Rock music, not a good one though. But from then on Adi - The Rock God just dragged me into it and I still have not come out of it. NIB (Sabbath) and Unforgiven (Metallica) were the very first songs he asked me to listen to and I liked the feel of it very quickly. From then we have been the best of rock/metal buddies. The times we have spent together listening to music, watching song videos, attending myriads of pub gigs(escape,one flight down, spanish fly) and college-fest gigs have been truly amazing. Once we were so desperate to attend a gig at Escape(DR if I remember it correctly) that we went in the rains. And there we were in an hour head-banging all soaked up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> At all these gigs, half time <br>we would mosh and head-bang and the remaining half he would be giving me some rock-gyaan on the music, bass lines, double bass, lead guitar, sound-man, band's info. We would come back, read the gig reviews on HRL and next day bitch about the self-proclaimed reviewers <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Totally kirraakk those times were. These days my passion for rock music has sort of died down (me not going for the Maiden gig is a testimony to that) but he is still going strong and you can catch him listening to the stuff anytime of the day.<br><br>A metamorphosis which needs a big big mention is he going from a teetotaller to a big time boozy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Yes, I again would take the credit for that. That night we were sitting under the Banayan tree, Adi, Himank, Ranga and me. And I said so many cool things about booze that he actually agreed to it and the next day he made his debut <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Now he has almost become a conaaseuir of drinks and is very fond of it. He was always ready to have his room for booze, be it NBH or OBH and at a time there was collection of 100 plus bottles in his room which we later desposed in an air-bag <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>A testimonial for Adi is incomplete without the mention of Wikipedia and Microsoft. He is so very obsessed with these two words. Even before he was placed with MS, he had switched to IE and all the other MS products <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Also cars intrigue him a lot these days. He is always spotting one or the other biggies in Jubilee and Banjara. Also he did wonderful work as a part of the Placement committee. Frankly speaking that was the first time I had seen him working that hard for a cause ( aalsi sala <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>Memorable moments include me giving him a pep talk on a couple of occassions, once when he screwed his 3rd semester and another one when he was insecure about him not being a good dancer or a singer. (Who sys you dont know how to sing <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Then there was the KK night at GRIET, Riders on the Storm, the aalsi episode at NBH-47. But the Mother of all the moments would be the night out we had near hi-tech with just a single bottle of beer, trying to convince each other that boozing is not bad, the occassion being the arrival of my bike in college <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Another thing which I remember is that he was the one who was concerned the most when I had screwed up big time at Freshers '05 <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Things changed between us after summers of '08. Probably we are not as close as we were in the previous years but I would like to take that in my stride and cherish all the wonderful time we spent together, all the amazing BC we did and ofcous music <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And whatever happens in  future, you have my respect mate. We might not meet very regularly in future but you can always let me know when you are thinking of me. It would make me feel better and make me recall a certain <br>lanky thin fellow with very less hair on his head, glasses, a watch, woodland and a serene confidence on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Wish you a Porsche v v soon.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>SongS for you : Tanhai, Yaaron, Summer of 69.</b></i></ul><br><br>
