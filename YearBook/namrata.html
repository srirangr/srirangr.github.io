<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>hmm.. sorry I could not write my earlier testimonial well. night around 5:00 ki raasa. so here comes my new testimonial<br><br>namrata gurunchi naaku antha ekkuva telidu. these are the impressions I used to have before talking to her and will also write my recent impressions.<br><br>Earlier impressions: A very active girl. I saw her many times jogging. She never talked to me. I was little bit afraid and shy of talking to her. I used to think of her as a bond in any subject whose knowledge exceeds 1000 times than mine. It is true too. I think it is because of her school. Her school rocks (as told by yv)<br><br>Listened that she can read any novel in 3-4 days or even in hours <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . She is a good dancer too. Her western dance for last cultural night was good. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . Wish I was as active as you. <br><br>I think she can make friends very easily. Her testimonials prove that. <br><br>After talking to her: Listened a lot about you from spandana. She told me you are one of her best friends. That itself qualifies what you are. Your new hair style is good. Thanks for you and spandana for selecting the shirt. Finally, I too have a good shirt. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> From what I observed from the past few days I can say that she is very cool, caring, friendly, sportive. She teases me a lot telling lets go out <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>She like pearls a lot. Hope she can posses them. All the best. Inka raayala ?? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I can write more <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but don't have time <br><br>bye <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ramya.html>Ramya Yaragani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>nammu... very good dancer. A movie database...don't know how she manages to watch so many of them. She is passionate about WWF and games as well. I came to know her better during our CAT classes. She is friendly and very dedicated, at times woke up at 5 A.M for classes. she  reads a lot...awesome knowledge...she keeps on talking until u run out of topics. I will remember all the days when I had fun in GH corridors with u ra. All the best...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Early on in my B.tech (read 2nd and 3rd sems), Namrata was the girl with who I'd interact the most. We'd have marathon chat sessions, some of them lasting over four hours! Back then, we'd use Yahoo! messenger- and I loved some of the smilies both of us used. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Just like that! I must admit that I truly enjoyed talking to her. We'd speak about so many things - sports, gossip, girls, acads.. Ahh.. I loved it back then! That was also a time when I thought I'd found a good friend <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Unfortunately, we moved apart over time, so much so that we don't even have each other on our friend lists on the messenger! (Yahoo-> Google <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) . I felt that you had some problems with me, blame me that I never tried to rectify them either. The issue with you was that you never allowed people to get close to you, you always maintained a distance. But I guess, I'll cherish some of the convivial memories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Coming to her, shes among the smartest females I've met. Shes got brains to go with her pretty face.. It was fun discussing issues with her. Some of her retorts were awesome.. Shes someone who can actually pull someone's legs with her wit. And yep, shes got real good command over the language. I love reading her pieces on her blog (which btw, has a very interesting url <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) . Needn't mention about her dancing skills.. Shes as graceful as one can get.<br><br>Namrata is a feminist to the extend of <i>nearly</i> being a chauvinist. I remember all those girls vs guys chats.. Especially with both of us pretty immature back then! But the admirable thing about her is that shes a smart and independent lady.<br><br>I remember one little incident, when I'd told her, "You've become a little fat". Cardinal sin! A week later, Spandana comes and tells me, "Why did you tell her that? She just doesnt eat now" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Wish you all the very best in life! May God bless.<br><br><b>Person she resembles: Oprah <br>Fav memory: The marathon 5 hour chat when she first got her laptop.<br>Message for her: Keep thinking and rocking! </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Earlier I used to read her blogs and think of her to be a fodu, english girl.(no offence meant) <br><br>But once I came to know her, now I think of her as a normal telugu girl who is caring, friendly and sweet. I think she is a living encyclopedia who has very good knowledge about many fields <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>She is good at pulling legs too. I should have known you earlier. I regret it now <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>All the best. Hope everything goes as you planned. <br><br>Bye <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She's the Powerpuff girluuuuuu!!!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>It was third year second sem when I had first spoke to her (one of those MBA classes if I am not wrong). Before that most of the conversations took place only through blogging. She writes some real good stuff and any post of hers you can easily expect a double digit no. of comments. You can speak to her on any topic, "any". Just to name a few - WWE <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> (Undertaker is Legendaaaaary!), Cricket, Football (Liverpool - Gerrard - Torres = My school football team), Tennis (Federer it is!),TV shows (Gossip Girls - somebody kill me), Music. I think we must have covered almost every section of a newspaper in the conversations that we had. I was the first one to break the news of her being placed in BoA (get to do that very often) and my ears went deaf for a moment.<br><br>Good luck with BoA and if you ever plan to rob your own bank you know whom to contact first <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Thanks for the bday cake and do invite me regularly - "cake ke liye hum kuch bhi kar sakte hai" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Now this might come as a surprise but it would have been unfair it I wouldn't write a testimonial for my only dance partner from the batch. I never talked to her before Felicity inaugral dance practice where she was my partner. Our interaction was not that much but by whatever it was I could easily make out that she is very soft spoken, kind and a very sensible girl. She is quite decent and that is one quality which I like the most.<br><br>I used to hear a lot about her in the first years from so many of my friends that there is this girl who is tooo good in English that baki sabki grades ki waat laga di hai. She is reasonably good at academics. I have not seen her playing any games so cannot comment on that. But when it comes to dancing, no one can beat her and she is undoubtedly the best dancer in our batch. The beauty about her dance is that she looks very comfortable in whatever style she dances be it classical, folk, salsa or western. I feel its her greatest strength.<br><br>That's it from me now. Just want to wish you loads of luck and my best wishes. Keep dancing wherever you go <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She is the girl next door in the hostel and the girl next chair in the classroom <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sitting beside each other for four long years in most of<br>the courses, we have had many experiences both good and bad <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is a big fan of this "Tollywood" game which anyone who sits besides her<br>will have to get habituated to... She is full of energy all the time.. I have never seen her getting bored doing anything she is interested<br>in.. She is a big book of short stories of all kinds - humour, love, heroic and tragedy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is a die-hard fan of Federer... You won't believe she cried for one whole day when he lost to Nadal... And also a huge fan of football!!  She doesn't play many sports but yeah has a very good knowledge about many of them.<br><br>Her vocab is simply awesome!! Her blogs will speak about it all... Congratulations for getting into BOA =d< Good Luck!!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nammu!<br>It has been quite a journey with this girl. We were great friends in the second year, then some misunderstandings and abhi "sabh kuch normal <img src=Smileys/1.gif />"<br>She is very smart, you can  talk to her about anything, right from Movies,Football to Politics. Huge fan of WWE and HBK. She is a damn good orator. We both were there in the A2 batch. And her speaking abilities were amazing.<br>She is one of the best dancer in the batch and I remember your MnM performance <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.  She is one of the best bloggers in the batch, did I mention "her writing skills are amazing!". Like any other girl she is damn worried about her looks and figure <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, don't worry lady you have become thin, almost on your way to achieve perfect figure, ab khush. She is a "Female Chauvinist", we have had endless dicussions on this topic.<br>I remember, our CBIT fest trip and the fun we had together, all your school friends talks, your special gang "forgot the name<img src=Smileys/10.gif />" and how<br>snobbish your gang was. I remember, the Dumb C session we had had just before the main house event were we kept enacting movies. Lady gets bored when I get into Funda pelofying avatar.<br>She has changed a lot in these four years.<br>Back then in second year, I felt she was living in a protective shell and she never wanted to come out of it and now I see a very different<br>girl, self dependent and independent. I see her as a smart composed lady who has over the years learned to deal with situations, truly <br>commendable <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>We have spent some amazing time together,It feels nice to have a friend like you!<br><br>Cheers!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=john.html>Samuel John</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>my only interaction with her was during BTP vivas that too few words , she always has a gud smile on her face <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> and friendly with evry1 <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>best wishes <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>------- </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I guess this testimonial would be incomplete without mentioning the Federer-Nadal match incident <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Ok! i wont give the details because others have already written about it, but it shows how incredibly passionate she is about certain things. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Although we have different tastes in movies and music - she loves old b/w hollywood flicks and i totally hate watching movies released before the year 2000! <img src=Smileys/10.gif />; i love listening to indie and alt rock! and she's into more traditional rock, pop and sometimes country music ( country music?? seriously <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) - but we are not entirely different when it comes to these things. She's a huge Coldplay fan, so there's atleast one band we both like, that's a plus. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>If you talk to her a few times you'll know how awesome she is at narrating incidents and telling stories. I dont know about others but i was never bored when she keeps talking about things like her school life and all those interesting incidents and 'adventures' she had with her gang! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sometimes she has a habit of repeating incidents/stories but thanks to my poor memory <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and the fact that everytime she tells those things in a very interesting way you dont get bored!<br><br>One thing i've realized recently is that she's also a great listener ( i was slightly surprised to be honest <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) and she's incredibly mature when it comes to certain things. I think it's because she knows and understand things very quickly. I havent met anyone who knows and understands people like she does.<br><br>I wish i've known you before but it's been great getting to know you in this short time and it's been a real fun, interesting and first of its kind (i've never been on a rollercoaster ride before <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ....kidding! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) journey! and i really hope it'll continue to be equally fun and interesting, if not more, in future. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Just when i started learning to live with the fact that i made a huge mistake by choosing ece over cse, i've got to know you! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And then the "kicking-myself-for-being-in-ece" phase started all over again <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and i kept asking myself "why the eff did i not shift to cse at the end of 1st year!?!" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Again!, thanks to me being in ece and the lack of common courses, except for cog sci (and u dont remember i was there in those classes!!! ante le! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ), and since i was practically living in my own little cave all those years there was no proper interaction between us ( only those occassional 'hey's and 'hi's ) But i have to thank google for making something like gtalk (aah! was trying not to say anything geeky here! eff! couldnt control myself <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) without which all those interesting and 'historic' <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> chats wouldn't have happened.<br><br>We started talking because of all those tv shows we keep watching! I never thought there'd be someone who'd watch that many tv shows. she probably watched more eps than i did! that's like crazy!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> the difference is that she maintains a good gpa and i dont. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Seriously, how did u manage that!?!? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> OTH was like the most discusssed tv series in our conversations, we both are like huuuge fans of that show. She's also super crazy about Entourage, House and Friends, which are like the best shows ever (although i havent watched Friends i can guess its awesomeness looking at how people, especially her, can go on for hours talking about it! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> )<br><br>Among many things, what sets her apart is her awareness and knowledge in a variety of issues and topics. Whether it's sports, WWE <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , politics, movies, music or even celebrity gossip <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> she always has something interesting to say. I believe there are very few people who would understand and have an accurate idea/opinion on so many things!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>hmm...She was among the first few ppl I met in IIIT...we were wingmates in the first year ..<img src=Smileys/1.gif />...she used to tell us a lot od stories then spanning all genres : horror,romantic,...she is a good story teller...and then there were conversations when she used to tell us abt the Jail she lived in for two years and all...well she being on of the few ppl who could speak hindi fluently was one of my first friends in IIIT....Then we had our english classes together and she was teacher's fav student...<br>She is an amazing dancer as well as an orator...<br>I always liked the way she performs on stage with so much grace and beauty...<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>She is quite confident and knows what she wants.....one of the  rare occasions when I found her nervous was felicity07...<br>Reads a lot of novels ...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>You never run out of topics to discuss with her...she is always up to date ...be it campus news,movies,tv series,sports...anything...<br>She is shopping freak <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... if you are going for shopping just ask her out ...you thoroughly enjoy her company ... thanx for convincing me to buy that dress <img src=Smileys/4.gif />..I love it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>She is a disciplined person....used to be among the first person to have brkfast in mess...early to bed and early to rise kinda person...she is quite systematic....has her head at the right place <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...<br><br>All the best for your future <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...I hope you do something really good in literature...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Message for you:</b>Do watch your actions at time.<br>Good Luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first time I met her was during Freshers practice and we were all set to do Kajra Re ... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I know that the guys screwed it up but it wasn't that bad after all.<br><br>And after that she was all silent types till the interhouse singing competition. She had already informed us in advance that she can;t sing. But still we selected her coz there were no other girls in Agni at that time. I'm pretty sure there was no sync in our voices. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And the next time I saw her on stage was during Felicity '06... dancing with Tavva. That was an awesome dance re. And yet another time on the same stage, same day for MnM.<br><br>She;s a very talented dancer. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> And she's helped Agni a lot with all the superb performances.<br><br>She's a bigggg Movie/TV Shows freak, WWF freak (seriously wtf! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> how come girls like all such violent action!!), she's got fodu English vocab too. <br><br>She;s very quick at guessing movies which was like a boon coz she'd always win a prize in DumbC. I was personally so shocked to see that she knows so many movies when we were playing DumbC on rooftop. (especially Tarqeeb <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />). <br><br>Also she reads a lot of books/novels and writes nice blogs too. (well, I dont read her posts regularly <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). And inspite of being so active she still manages to get a decent CGPA.<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>And she;s very very good at giving presentations. During BTP Viva, our group was just after theirs and we used to watch from outside how she explains the whole content/algo while Samrat running/explaining the code in the background. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Doing BTP under Ramu was a great fun. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future da!

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Namrata and I</b> have had quite a unique relationship over these years. We've fought like cats and dogs - something which was both unwanted and unnecessary. But credit must go to her for having the maturity to forego her ego not once, but several times in the final year and meeting me in the middle on several issues. So much so that we can now laugh about those bygone days of fights and dislike and can take back a lesson or two from there as we leave the college.<br><br>As a person, I would say that Namrata is highly talented and has developed a personality which would really take her places. A fellow Agniite, she has participated in and has won several cultural and literary awards for Agni over the years. She's good looking, is smart and/ or disciplined enough to have quite a high CGPA, speaks three languages fluently, dances really well, reads a lot, writes well. Her database spans across topics like sports, politics, sitcoms and movies, besides (I assume) others. She was a finalist in Ms Felicity contest and is charming to talk to. What more would a guy ask for! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I mean, the way things look like, I see Namrata as a perfect high-society lady, hosting lavish dinners not too far from now. Jab aisa ho to apne is former ladai partner ko bhoolna mat, aur kabhie ekaadh parties mein hamein bhi invite kar lena <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I now know see her as a smart, composed and forthright person who knows what she wants from life, and doesn't believe in stereotypes. I like the way you stay comfortable in your skin and give a damn about people who don't matter. I wish we hadn't had so many misunderstandings, but all's well that ends well and I'm happy that we're leaving college on a happy note.<br><br><b>It's likely that we'll</b> work together, and I'm looking forward to it. Although in that case there'll be plenty of time to say all this, but I do would like to wish you here the very best that life has to offer. <br><br><b>Memories:</b> The conversation at coffee shop, cat fights.<br><b>Message for you:</b> Words can kill.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

So totally into sports, WWE, TV shows a complete movie buff she is, yet does great at acads.. We have had a lot of fun - chatting from others' accounts <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , god knows how many lives we have destroyed..

She is crystal clear about her plans and priorities - something for which I adore her..

<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nammu.. She is the one whom I first talked among girls in our batch. I still remember that conversation. She is very straight forward, friendly, caring, sensitive. She is an absolute puzzle for a stranger to understand her. She is a box of varieties. Many to their surprise we never have downs in our friendship. We built our friendship very strongly understanding each other and respecting each others' opinions and values. Many of our batch mates know me as just a box of PJs. But she is one of the best friends who knows real me. I some times gives small advices to her. But I never thought she takes them seriously. I came to know when she took my advice for taking the very important decision of her life. It is very difficult for me to hide anything with her. We became more close at the time of BTP and during Viva, she used to give me confidence when I get tensed and I used to when she was. I just want to say everyone that trust one person completely and never expect anything from the other side, it will definitely leads to a great relationship. <br>		Apart from our relationship, she has a very good sense of humor and great managerial skills that one should inspire from her. She is a well matured person and knows what to do at any situation. Sometimes I got surprised that how can such a lazy person works hard at times of need. She is the person who introduced me to Apprentice seasons and I enjoyed those episodes very much. I was a big fan of her on the dance floor. She is a very bad singer. Still we managed a group song and it was lot of fun for the listeners. I watch movies very often but coming to Eng movies, I watch selective list of movies given by her and I think she is the best critic of Eng movies.  <br>		She is one of the friends who lend me great support in dark days of my placement and filled me with loads of confidence. But to our destiny we got separated as I got placed in LPU. I really miss u a lot<img src=Smileys/6.gif /> I wish, I hope and I promise that Sammu-Nammu friendship never gets strained.

<b><a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nammu is one of the few girls whom I look upto. She is Bubbles when it comes to powerpuffgirls, Barkha Dutt when it comes to discussions, IBNLIVE when it is news-updates, Sobha Naidu when it is dance, an old friend whom you met after several years-when it is chit-chatting, Shakespeare when it comes to story telling and is herself when it comes to Federer or Justin Timberlake or Liverpool. She used to stay next to my room in first year and we thereby have many sweet memories to share. I used to play a tragic song early in the morning and now I understand how badly it must have hurt her. She plays equally awful songs to avenge that torture <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It is truly fun to be with her for she is a very good speaker and listener. Cannot forgot those fun-filled times when we used to walk to indira nagar to lose fat and have Chinese manchurian there <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, the late night journeys from VJA-HYD, munching more and more food in balaji and IEG and awesome games we play in IEIR classes. Hatsoff to your questionnaires! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> If there is anything more I would her for-I will have to write my whole 4-2 here because I'm sure we will have wonderful time together.
