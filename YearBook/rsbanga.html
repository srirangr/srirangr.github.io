<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Banga Sahb is simple, down to earth and always helpful. I have never seen him shout at anyone or use a bad word. Is simply brilliant at what he does. Any given situation if you need an optimal solution, Banga is there for you <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> like he is been there before <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. It was a learning experience for me to conduct placements along with you. The way you tackled situations, managed not to lose patience when interacting with GAG .. wow! just amazing <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. We have still lots of work to be done - both Samvedana and Placements and I am sure with you being as one of the leading hands, it should be a cake walk. <br><br>Wishing you loads of success.</b></i></ul><br><br>

I am impressed with your dedication towards anything you do whether it is studies or placements or social work. <br><br>I came more close to this chap when we were working for one single goal to place our batchmates. He is honest and hardworking. Lot of work is handled by him and aditya till me and sambhav were placed.

<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>he may be the nicest guy I ever met. very helpful to others. Generally people are helpful to others. But in his case its different. He helps everyone.<br><br>He do not want to trouble any person. Thats why I think even if he has some need or favour to ask, he does it by himself. Down to earth guy.<br><br>You are an amazing maan. Don in academics <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.

<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>          A genius, even the word genius sounds like an understatement when it comes to talk about you. All the interactions we had are always impersonal and of what I could know about him - he is this guy with an equal blend of religiousness and practicality, something which is not quite easy to find and to manage. It is quite difficult to balance equally both of them, but he has got the talent to do it.<br><br>           It is really amazing the amount of efforts you have put up as a placement lead <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . <br>I whole heartedly thank you for your interest in Samvedana and your whole hearted involvement in the initial stages when an individual dream was taking a shape into something concrete. Hoping to work with you for Samvedana, in Samvedana. Wishing you truck loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part1 </b><br>The only word sufficient to describe him is <b> "BANGA" </b>. The <b>PERFECTIONIST</b> of our batch. He really excells at anything he does. He has tremendous belief that one can do everything in life and excell at it. He is genius.... Think of any good qualities... All those you will find in Banga... Very noble hearted... Has great faith in religion... Very firm on morals and ethics... He is devoted to the noble work for the society....<br><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Itna soft speaking banda maine aaj tak nahi dekha... Very calm and composed <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....Main to sochta hoon kabhi to thoda gusse me aayega...Gussa to dur ki baat hai...Thodasa aggressive bhi nahi hota!!! <br>Lekin iska ek faayada hai- Kisi ko bhi pata sakta hai apni baaton se <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Waise ye batane ki jaroorat nahi hai ki Banga aajkal college me nahi rehta <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. Though I miss you a lottttt (really a lot) in the campus and so the group, I think you are doing the noble work and you enjoy it. If somebody will ask me what is banga's biggest quality? I would say - "Listening to the heart and not caring what others will say".  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Padhai likhai me to bhai Banga bahot bada bond hai... Grades se to usko bahot jyada pyaar hai... CGPA aise hi thodi na banati hai phir <img src=Smileys/3.gif />... Lekin jab grade kharab aata ho to kaphi dukhi hota hai... Discrete maths me 'B' aane ke kaaran bechara kitne dino tak sadme tha... <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <br><br>Banga ne mujhe bahot subjects padhaye hai... Banda bahot cool tareeke se padhata hai... Saamne wala kitna bhi dumb question pooche Banga har cheez ki bade aaram se aur pyar se samajhata hai... Great patience indeed <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>Bahot careless attitude hai bande me...Kahi pe bhi koi bhi cheez chhod ke jaata hai... <br><br>In first year he was very very innocent... Kabeer used to pull his leg a lot... used to take photo while sleeping... Ye bechara padh bhi nahi paata tha... Raat me kabeer sone ke baad Table lamp laga ke padhta rehta tha...<br><br>Iske room mates ne isko bahot tang kiya hai...Baba bhi kuch kam nahi hai...

Alok ke naam chillane se pehle sab log Banga Banga hi chillate rehte the...<br><br>Log isko sirf Banga ke hi naam se jaante hai... Ek baar kuch kaam se isne charan ko phone kiya tha...Banga bolta hai- Main Randeep Singh bol raha hoon...Charan bechara pehchaan hi nahi paaya, wo poocha kaun Randeep.... Banga laga raha- Arey Randeep Singh bol raha hoon...Do teen baar yahi hua phir bhi wo nahi pehchana... Phir finally Banga bola- Arey main BANGA bol raha hoon....Wo turant samajh gaya...

Jab dekho phone pe kuch kaam pe rehta hai....Bhai bada aadmi ban chuka hai....<br><br>Banga is an ideal example of selfless dedicated work.... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He has done commendable work for the Placement committee...

<b><a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Randeep Singh Banga ( Banga in short ), is a really helpful and friendly person. Very calm, composed mature as well. He's one of the guys I appreciate the most in our batch. I admire him for his hardwork and sincerity. He can sacrifice sleep just for studying for a mid-semester examination <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He's very religious sort of a person. About his helpful nature, he did lots of work during the placement sessions both in terms of helping people learn things, and doing the other necessary work of placement committee.<br><br>You are a really good friend to have, and I will remember you. One thing that I want to tell you is that you should have more fun and dont worry too much about some of the things <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><br>Randeep in general has a very calm , matured and a sweet personality. So sweet that he had to face teh axe of Bc for full 2 years, just because he won't <br>reply back partially for the fear of hurting anybody ( partially ue to the fact he had no answers <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) though it did hurt him a lot of times. but whatever it hurt him or not he nevr refused help to anybody ever.<br><br> <br>Having said all this, this is not what makes randeep what he is. What's so soecial about him is his pursuit for the ultimate truth.<br>His passion and zeal for knowledge far beyond other's reach. a tru sikh that's randeep for you. He has done commendable job along with dharmeet in the social service sector. Having said this he is subject to influence and was a nig time frusto due to gkB's aura in 2nd year. Thank God he got out quickly.<br><br>The time I spent with him in M$ was simply awesome. All the bakar we two did, pool and foosball matches we played and jo siyapa hamne paya hein together. The volleyball and tennis games <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Best times ever. Remember the cricket match we watched together? Chips , coke and 43 inch screen on ultra cool sofa set's and discussing how life is so good.<br><br>I think we ahve a special connection. Remember teh fight we had and the shopping sprees <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( read the testi he worte for me for details ).<br><br>WIll Miss you for:Won't miss you , u ain't going anywhere <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Most memorable moment:M$ and tutes   <br>Msg for u:learn to say no ( not to me though <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>Song for u: ramta jogi ..<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the qualities that defines Randeep is sacrifice. He will sacrifice sleep , food and almost anything else for his studies. He will<br>sacrifice his time and rest for teaching anybody who comes to his door for a last minute tute. Unlike others, he will give all he has  <br>and would genuinly teach everybody. In some ways I owe my degree to randeep. I remember the day before dld final exam. I had fared bad in first mid<br>-sem and played cz all day on this day. At 12.00 in night I turn up to banga and say teach me,Banga has been working all day and is tired and about to<br>sleep but when I said I don't know anything at all. He taught me  ( but we both fell asleep in 15 min and covered teh whole dld in half an hout next<br>morning <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ). By his efforts I passed in DLd ( C my lowest <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) . It was impoosible to pass any of the maths course without him either. Another example of his<br>dedication and sacrificing nature is teh effort he put in for placments. He was the only one who listened to even GAG seriously.<br><br>He is among the most dedicated people in IIIT. he is actually too dedicated <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, to such an extent that it frustoo's others <br>( read karan's testi). He can do almost anything for a good grade, used to study till he literally fell asleep. His room open, <br>tublight on, he with notes his hand and his mouth open sleeping is a very common sight in exam days. When ever I saw him like this I used to turn of the lights, wake him up and tell him to close the door and sleep but he wakes up too much he will study again <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> such is his dedication <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But if thi all <br>fails he will go the extent of patofying teachers for an A <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Randeep Singh Banga Aka banga is among my best friends in IIIT and one of the most poupular <br>guys in the batch. Randeep is gem of a person, he is like a tresure pile full of virtues, a tree which <br>gives shade to everybody who comes towards him. He is among the very very few people in life to whom I<br>might turn up when I feel like things are not going right ( almost never <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) or when I need advice.<br>Someone with who I can share everything, someone I can turn to when things aren't that right.<br><br>Like most of my friends in IIIT, I and randeep started on a wrong foot, but gradually things got better and<br>we became best friends. I think one of the factors which brought us closer was that we both have a well thought <br>out religious viewpoint of life and also we both were frustrated by our roomies <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Randeep's popularity in the batch is legendary <br>We all remember all the "banga banga" chants in the classes. Infact a lot of people didn't knew randeep by face but everybody <br>knew "banga". He is one of the most genuine sweet persons I have ever met and it shows in his every action. He laughs with u when u are happy<br>and soothes u when u are sad.He is very sensitive about people's feelings and nevr hurt anybody ( just like alok <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br> No wonder he is so popular among batchmates.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is one of the most sincere students I have ever met. Apne kitne saare batchmates ka isne udhaar karaaya hoga, shayad ye bhi nahi jaanta. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He always looks interested in any and every class!!<br>His face reminds me of the cartoon characters Chip and Dale (dude, no offence, but you look cute, hence the connection <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). He is very humble and hard working.<br>Once during a festival of Sikhs, I attended the celebration which included singing the holy songs and shabd (i hope that's what they're called), and I saw Banga taking active part in the whole event, talking about Sikhism and the Gurus, playing table or dholak I think, and singing as well.<br>All the best for the future!! I'm sure it'll be better although not the same as these days of our lives. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Banga saab apne ... one of the most dedicated person of our batch. bade vinamra swabhaw ke insan hain.

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Banga<br><br>Amazing guy. Very dedicated towards whatever he does. Asks doubts in classes. Very intelligent. This guy has innumerable qualities. Whenever I feel the need for dedication in myself, I look upto 3 guys: Vibhav, Banga and Karan. I feel more attached with him and Ankush because I feel their duo to be very much similar as that of Adi's and mine. I have spent some quality time with him. BC sessions in cellar at his room with Pankaj, Ankush, Alok and him can never be forgotten. We took almost similar courses in our Btech. If we remove our names and personal details from our resumes, then those will look almost identical and it'll be really hard to correctly match those again with our names - same intern in second year (Pramati Middleware technologies), same intern in third year (Microsoft IDC), BTPs sponsored by Microsoft Open Source, job in same company as well (Microsoft), almost similar courses. Seriously, if I don't feel like making my resume, I could have his <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I find him very intelligent and very much serious towards his duties which I admire in him. When we used to sit with each other before MS Open Source presentations, I would find Ankush to be calm as always and this guy, very serious and continuously reading and thinking regarding what will he speak over there, a quality which I admire a lot in him. This guy is very religious as well, a quality worth admiring especially in a guy of his age. This guy is a genuine bond and there is a lot to be learnt from him. May God give you all the happiness and success in your life. Keep rocking <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Cheers<br>Manish</b></i></ul><br><br>

I saw that in cellar, he'd sleep all day but study with such concentration that he woudn't need anything else. The MS PPO was totally well deserved, cheers for that mate! He is also pretty religious, is it so common among Punjabis? So much so, that he hardly spends any time in the college these days <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> .

I am damn sure even after he has completed B.Tech, if he wish he could go for Medical and will excel there.He does each and everything with the same <br>passion, and I seriously dont know if he has his interest in any particular thing. Jab banga sahab se hamari mulakat hui thi first sem mein to banga sahab bade hi seedhe saadhe bacche the. Inki batein sunkar to maine apna sir pakad liya...hey <br>bhagwaan mein kahan aa gaya... he was all about study, a bit philosophy and a bit religious. Aur cheejon ka to gyaan hi nahin tha banga sahab ko... so thank me for sharing all the knowledge with you <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... initially banga saab used to be at the recieving end of each BC session and that because of his all stupid acts. If he does not know anything, he wont accept it. Once it so happened that we asked him something and he pretend as if he was completely aware of that SOMETHING and later on he was caught by Ankush searching for the same thing in dictionary  and then us baat par to banga sahab ki bahut hi mari <br>gayee thi. Initially Banga was not at all sporty, aur gussa bhi ho jate the kabhi kabhi...ek do baar to shayad sachin aur pankaj ko sentiyan bhi maar chuke the... but maine kabhi bhi banga saab ko jyada pareshaan nahin kiya...kyun bhai..sahi hai na.. becoz either he or me was the soft target for everyone. Banga jitne dedication ke saath kuchh padhta tha..utne hi dedication ke saath hamein padhata bhi tha. jab tak sabko sari cheej samajh mein na aa jaye, banga saab haar nahin mante the.Phir Jab Saini ne laptop le liya aur uska sara samay bandiyon mein hi bitne laga, to banga saab ko bhi laga ki kucch maje liye jayein aur phir isne to hadd hi kar di..har samay bas bandiyan bandiyaan and bandiyan..chahe Hi 5 ho chahe yahoo messenger ya phir NIFT.. banga was so desperate at that time for making new female friends.. kyun bhai galat to nahin likh raha na.

In first week we used to  play TT very often. He is very good in TT and his service was difficult to pick <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He used to go home that time also but not frequenly he used to go now . Now its like he comes to IIIT <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. In ragging time I remember when Lohiya asked me to sing the slowest song possible and asked him to do bhangra as if some fast song is playing. It was fun watching you dancing on tracks of "Duniya mein hum aaye hain" from Mother India <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. In the exam times he just goes mad. He keeps studying till he falls asleep. He hardly sleeps for 4-5 hrs in exam time, but the good thing is after that he used to teach all of us <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.In first year , if someone is pulling his leg, and you try to help him, he will always brings you down with him <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. We made the golden rule of LET him being teased. Its better him than you <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .He became so famous among us by name "Banga" that we hardly remember/know his real name. Once I got a call from an unknown number, I asked "who is this?" The person replied "Randeep", I asked "Randeep who". Reply came "are yaar banga bol rha hoon" <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.In ITWS-2 class everyone used to shout "Banga" to point out "enough for today, end this class". He was too innocent and sidha-sadha bachcha when joined IIIT (not anymore <img src=Smileys/3.gif />), I remember we were talking about some adult stuff, and this guy sitting in the corner with dictionary in his hands was checking meaning of words we were talking about <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Has a great dressing sense <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. In starting of 3rd sem he gone mad for CZ.

Used to spend all his Sunday morning in Gurudwaras.You can always here "Gurbani" whenever you pass by his room <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Coming to acads he is in top 5 of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> altough he doesn't know how to format system till 4th sem <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He works hard for getting an "A" in the subject, by hook or crook <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Often finds a way to impress prof. by his intelligence.. When he flunged his google intern interview, he worked twice hard for his selection in MS . To me he always seems to be a Microsoft guy.It was great for us also you cleared the interview <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. The lovely MS outing  all Summer'08 was just awesome. I am sure you will have good time in MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>	His dedication and commitment could be seen in placement time.
