He laughs at his own jokes without even caring to see if anyone else is on his side or not. Most of the times his jokes are so hilarious that people like me literally <b>roll on the floor laughing my ass off, cleaning the corridor in which VV lives and people can't bear the smellll</b> in short ( ROFLMAOCTCIWVVLAPCBTSll .. courtesy urban dictionary ). <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. btw did anybady notice the extra "l" in the spelling of "smelll" ?? <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>He's got an awesome pic in orkut and girls keep sending him friend requests. Maaku koncham hellp cheyyi ra <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>This guy is with me in Verizon. Will have to bear him for more time to come <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Don't worry dude, I'll cover my nose with a cloth <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>That was the fun part. Now coming to Cricket. This guy is an awesome batsman and is very good at playing shots on the leg-side. He's so perfect that even if there are 4-5 fielders, he can find the gap. He's an awesome fielder too. As far as I know, he is the person who must have caught the highest number of catches in all the matches that we played in Summers 2k7 and during my 3rd and 4th years. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He's even good at studies. Not a Kasi candidate but the kind of a guy who can look after his own assignments and all quite perfectly.<br><br>He's also a very enthusiastic guy when it comes to leg pulling.<br><br>What else do I have to tell about you. As long as we are in Verizon, we won;t miss each other. All the best for your future and keep rocking as always.<br><br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2:<br>=======<br><br>Though he doesn't seem so, he is very very big "kasi". He's very talented and a hard-worker (a rare combination), very good at math. The devotion and commitment with which he does his projects, CAT preparation and BTP is simply amazing and exemplary. Yahoo and Hadoop needs a guy like you dood... <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. I envy you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>I hope you still remember those days when we use to rag juniors. Esp in 4-1 sem we used to gather in your room and discuss about ____ for hours together. Though we don't do it anymore, I've learnt a lot from you in those days. <br><br>You'll be among the very few friends of my life I'll never ever forget. Great to have a friend like you ra...

<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1:<br>=======<br><br>Writing a testimonial isn't easy. And when you decided to do it for this guy, there are so many things you could possibly write about that choosing the right ones and restricting to 3000 characters (readable) is very difficult. So, here it goes -- in two parts.<br><br>This guy's name is Chaitanya Krishna OR Chinni Krishna (in his childhood days). The word "krishna" is included in both the names. And rightfully so. For, it is evident from the way he flirts girls (though only in Orkut and Chatting). He's also called as "Vasana" VV or "Despo" VV or simply VV by us.<br><br>His day in IIIT-H starts after I wake him up for breakfast. Brushes his teeth for one hr, combs his hair for 1 hr and wearing sandals takes another 1/2 hr. He cracks very foul smelling jokes/counters justifying his nick "vasana". I don't know how many times Rama, Goti, Sha2 and I made fun of him in mess but you didn't lose your cool. Always tries to make sure that his nick "vasana" is apt for him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> You won't get bored when you are with him -- keeps on talking about something or the other. Analyzing other people especially girls is what he does all the time. And a pretty good one at that. This word "vasana" is so closely associated with him that he could literally see smell (or sniff at) and tell the bio-data of any girl. Always keeps himself up-to-date with current affairs, literally <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Kilometer dooram nunchi kooda despo ani pilisthe palukuthadu ee "pichi naa xxxxx". He's a loveguru. Or so does he think of himself? Half of the time you'll find him singing sentimental telugu songs which, obviously, is very irritating. Photollo choosi sambar lo kaalu veyyakandi... veedu pedda kantri gadu. Overall, a very friendly, helping, trust-worthy, hard-working and funny friend you'll become so addicted that you can't live without.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ma day in IIIT now a days starts wid VV and ends wid VV (in all da rite senses).. he patiently wakes me up in da morning though i keep sayin "inka 5 min ra" nd in da night v hang out together playing "business" lyk small kids wen da rest of da guys r off "boozing" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (no1 can beat our winning streak dude)..
