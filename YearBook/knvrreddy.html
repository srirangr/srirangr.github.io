<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>King Reddy/Rama Reddy/Banda Reddy/Banda Reddy Erra Cheddi/Local from Kukatpally/Reddy (as I call him)<br><br>Me: Arey neeku Old city telusa? Aanta naa area. Call me Khan.<br>Reddy: Local alias Ramareddy from Kukatpally<br><br>This is how we introduced ourselves in the first year. I must have spent millions of hours interacting with him on some non sense topic. He and Goutham (the perfect Laural Hardy pair) can go on and on and on .. they never run out of topics. And we three form the perfect sollu buddies. He is super intelligent. He sleeps in the class most of the time but still manages to get an A. Once a cockroach tried entering his room, but unfortunately it could not bear the smell of his room and died. From this we concluded that the scent of his room can be used to manufacture cockroach killing drugs. But it was worser than that. It even kept away humans and gottams from entering in his room. This lead to further conclusions that he is well know in kukatpally area for genocide acts and gets most of the chemicals from his room. <br><br>Its was great knowing you. Touch lo vundu.<br><br>In the name of all those cockroaches that died in your room. Amen! <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

I hope he gets his thesis done in another yr <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I dont think his prof knows abt his football addiction; or else, he'll b praying 2 God 2 make him work <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> With his new hair(band)style, I doubt if girls arnd him wud allow him 2 work <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>But seriously, he's one gr8 frnd i cud hav 4 my lyf! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's so understanding and wenever ne of his frnds is sad or in trouble, the way he consoles or solves their probs is truly superb <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He has a unique charm which makes his frnds listen 2 him and get convinced. He's 1 guy whom i can presume 2 b available wenever i need ne help <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The hardwork he's showing towards organising batch trip <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> is one piece of evidence 4 my presumption. I'm sure tht with his presence, I can enjoy my last batch trip in IIIT in the best possible atmosphere <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> U ROCK MAN!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>"Yo Pro -- We Pro" <img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br>Now before you start wondering what this stupid thing is and jumping to any meaningful conclusion, lemme tell you my dear friends, there are umpteen such seemingly stupid yet funny and addictive one liners uttered by this guy everyday which literally have no meaning.<br><br>Ram Reddy alias Ram a.k.a Remo Reddy a.k.a Banda Reddy is one of my very close friends who values friendship more than anything else in this world. A very talented, helpful, lazy, unpunctual and, dare I say, dirty guy but very kind at heart. He's very good at all sports especially football. We share many interests like passion for bikes and food. One thing I like about him is he never says no to anything asked; be it movie/restaurant/trip unless he's got an appointment with his favorite professor Anoop. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Always stays ahead when doing crazy things and teasing others with his slang.<br><br>He's the only person, as far as I know, who can counter "Counters" Goutham seamlessly breaking the monotony. And a very good one at that. Or so does it seem?<br><br>Be what you are and all the best for your thesis and future. Do invite me when you present your thesis. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Rama Reddy, one of five ECD bakras of our batch(me inlucded), When i saw him for the first time, i thought he would be one of dadas of our batch. But as it turned out, he turned out to be one of the brainest, coolest guys in our batch. I would always remember the first time that i went to his room (It left me speechless to be honest). Overall a cool guy to hang out with and do BC regarding our so-called MS.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
