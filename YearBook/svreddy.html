<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Vicky... An awesome guy.<br><br>I have known this chap from four years now and even today he's just the same. We used to copy C assignments in 1st year for which our names were listed out and from then on we never copied again(actually, he didn't.. but I did <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>He was also with me in A4 and was a very enthusiastic guy who asked about the meanings and usage of all sorts of weird words and sometimes confused her. But it was fun man! I'm gonna miss those days! <img src=Smileys/20.gif /><br><br>This guy is very tough. You can't leofy him very easily. He can kick your ass (oh! btw, did I mention his new nick .. WeakAss .. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> which is actually ironic <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). His room is always clean and crystal clear. We used to watch all sorta things in first year. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Is till remember I was watching dash in his room and I suddenly got a call from home. I lifted it and started speaking. This guy sala instead of decreasing the volume, he increased it <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. I had to run away from his room that day.<br><br>But as I remember it today, it was awesome fun man being with you in first year.<br><br>Also, this guy has a very bad habit of putting nick names some of which turn out to be the nick name throughout the college life. eg: SCP.<br><br>He's a linux geek <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. His stat mesg always starts with "Amarok: blah! blah!". He was the BTP partner of our dear Vinay and they did one helluva racha during BTP.<br><br>All the very best for your future mama ...

OS freak (just celebrated installing a century OS.s) spends half of his time in browsing thru wikimapia and other half in reading reviews (he even reads reviews for <b>pencils</b>)<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> he is the first guy i have seen who sweats more than me<img src=Smileys/4.gif />..<br><br>we had an excellent time in these past 3 years like the trip we had, countless laughs we had during our lunch and dinner and the time we spent doing BC and I hope to have a lot more<br>such moments..<br>Always keeps a smile on his face.
