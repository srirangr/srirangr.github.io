<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> Part 2 </b><br><br>        It was for SE presentation that we started talking, I know how difficult I was with everybody, pushing people to work etc. We shared the stage together for one really funny skit, eating chips on the dais, etc. We both were the victims of CVIT and used to tell our woes to each other, only becoming closer. Then Samvedana happened, and I am glad that it did, because, not just did we are trying to do something good to others, a lot of us have become a lot closer than we were before <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>	The innumerable number of <i>sollu</i> sessions we had in cog sci lab with you and bhargava where I just used to barge into the lab and start blabbering wasting your precious time. To top this all, the best memory would be the five hour marathon in cie lab quite recently where  you, sharat, sashidhar, prateek and myself were reading, or should I say, enacting what was written for him, by him .. ahem ahem <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. This I consider as one of the best memories I share with you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	Finally, I hope you reach the greatest heights which you aim for in your life. You can, I am sure and you deserve to reach there. Wishing you truck loads of best wishes <br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

So here goes a testimonial for Goki (sorry, can i call you so, or is it like <b>the</b> name which only <b>the</b> conferrer can use? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ).<br><br>	Jokes apart, Gopal is one of the persons whom I admire the most for one thing - sticking to what you like doing, even when the whole world is not really supportive. You like your good old culture, your traditions, your language, your principles, you want to stick to it. People around you sometimes mock at you, do not share the same passion as you have, and at some point of time, you slack and give up - This is the normal story, nothing new. But, there are few people who actually stand against the tide and it takes a lot of courage to do so and Gopal is one of them. I admire him for this from the bottom of my heart. <br><br>	 But, he is not conservative when it comes to dreaming big and working towards them. I admire him for the effort he has been putting towards his work for Muse, his own MS thesis and last but never the least - Samvedana. Its our brain child, I keep telling him and we need to nurture it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He calls me a perfectionist, I call him someone who stands one step above the perfectionist zone. I never really expected you can bear all the stupid jokes I crack about him, about others, in short my blabber <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 3 </b><br><br>Its always fun to play with him during the mess time. He never gets angry. Actually, he never uses slang and you can pull his leg for hours and hours and hours. The discussions in mess were always about his shirt or hair style. Oh! Now that I've come to his hairstyle point, lemme tell you about some(I can't explain all qualities here <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) of the important qualities of his hair.<br><br>#1. You can;t use a comb to comb his hair<br><br>#2. His hair can be used to make tooth-brushes.<br><br>#3. You need to have a gardening scissors to cut his hair.<br><br>#4. Never put your hand inside his hair. Its like a black hole. It seems last time a rabbit went in and still it didn;t come out <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>#5. Stay away from his hair during rains. They may expand in any direction<br><br>#6. If you ever see a parrot/bird making nest on his hair, kick it out.(with a stick ofcourse, usage of hand can be dangerous <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) It might die.<br><br>I think this is enough. Ain't it?<br><br>Coming back to acads, this guy has biiiiig dreams and he's working hard to achieve them, pushing his limits everyday. When he told me about his Cognitive science experiment, I was shocked. I read about such experiments on very high standard university blogs. Never expected that research in IIIT was of such a high quality. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> bro again.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br><b>Gopal is made for Google, <br><br>Google is made for Gopal. <br><br>Gopal and Google are made for each other. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>And hence his nick is Google Gopal. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> </b><br><br>Linux is his love, but Google is his life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (Heavy dialogue <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br><br>Ok enough of this Linux/Google stuff. Lets come back to Gopal. Oops! Till now, I've been making a spelling mistake. Its not Gopal. Its <b>Gopala</b>. Sorry dude! My lazyness won;t allow me to correct all the mistakes that I did in the above testi. I hope its perfectly fine <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Also, Mr. Gopala has an awesome taste for old Telugu songs. In fact Telugu language as a whole. Mozilla has officially declared his blog as the best for installing something. (gurtu ravatam ledu mama.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Also his blog got selected in some top level bloggers competition. Unfortunately, it didn;t win. <br><br>Ok. Where was I? Yeah. Telugu music and songs. OMG!! A live database of a hundreds of thousands of songs. But when it comes to Hindi, he follows my advice <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I likes it. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He's also a very nice singer. I remember him standing on the stage and singing some song for Vayu(-unsubscribe). The trio, (vibbu, Goki, Ambu) was looking awesome on the stage. Since I'm talking about the stage, lemme tell you people one more thing. On Felicity Singing prelims, I saw Gopala as the judge and he said "Vachesava! Kummeyi!" and anthe, I didn't give a damn and started singing "Masakkali" which was like my best performance on stage till date. Thanks for that moral support bro <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>

He knows a lot about a lot of things <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. And still, he's so simple and down-to-earth.<br><br>I met this guy through Bharat Ram in first year. We know each other right from the time of first mid-sem exams. He used to attend the famous Ambati tutorials. And Ambati was my neighbour. In fact, I attended those tutes too. It was during the tutes time that we spoke to each other. I used to do all <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> things and he was quite serious about the subject. But as they say "In the end it doesn't even matter". How true! Our GPA's were the same till the end of last sem (3-2). But sala he got an awesome grade in honors project and now his GPA is greater than mine. But does that even matter?? We both stopped caring about our GPAs from the time when we were chaddi-buddies <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Coming to the most most important part of this testimonial. If I don't mention about this in his testimonial I'd be an ass. (Donkey raa... tappu ga ardham chesukoku <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) And that word my dear ladies and gentleman is <b>  Google </b> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Gopal aka Koduri aka Koddri</u><br><br>Linux Geek, Bloggger and a guy passionate about his mother land and native tongue, these are the most visible qualities of this soft spoken, sweet natured and friendly guy. He is one guy, who u wouldnt think twice before asking for any help, coz you know he will always do his bit to help you out. He is a fellow passionate blogger, always ready to play his part in anything related to it.<br><br>Being a person, who feels strongly for his native tongue (Hindi), I have always admired his dedication to the cause of increasing awareness about Telugu. Dont generally people who are so dedicated to such causes. Gotta say your idea of writing technical posts in regional languages is a brilliant one, but being a lazy bum that I am, dunno how much I would be able to do in this regard.<br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future, may you get all that you want <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>An advice : Always keep smiling as you do now!</b><br><br>Cheers!!

<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Goki ante linux. Linux ante Goki. I don't remember how many times I re-installed my PC because I have enough support from this guy every time. I personally lot of times iritated him with linux issues but he clmly solved my problems. He is an ultimate lover of telugu, traditions and culture. He is still trying to protect these things in his own way. He is an ardent follower of telugu novels.<br>  He gets angry very quickly when comes to arguments. This is the only thing I suggest him to decrease his anger. Many milestones ahead of him. I wish him best of luck.<br>  </b></i></ul><br><br>
