<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=sagrawal.html>Shashank Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is a real academician. During my preparations of GRE he gave me some wonderful suggestions that really helped me. His ideas of reading The Hindu, the dictionary, NYT etc were really superb. <br>He is the guy converted to dual to pursue his ambitions. Had he sit for placements he would have got into some very nice(high package giving) company but he preferred research over it. Very inspirational indeed <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Now a days you can either see him in room reading some research paper or with Shikha. I guess in the near future he is going to named as Shashank- The know it all man. <br>A hardworking and persistent guy. Recently got selected in to Google Summer of Code. He is happy because he gets the money that he needs for sustenance. Now this attitude of finding a way against all the odds is something I really appreciates. <br>Bhai, dubara se khelna kudna shuru kar do. Khelte rahne se apadhai bhi achi hogi.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>MUX ke saath rahkar aap kabhi bore nahin ho sakte. Iska koi na kissa koi na koi baat appko hansa hi degi. Keep up this habit buddy. This habit of spontaneity is really god gifted. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>MUX ek zindadil insaan hai. First year main ye seniors ko kitna hansata tha aur mere saath apne dukhde share karta tha canteen main. <br>He is very unpredictable too. You never knows what he is upto. Marathe madam ki class main telugu padhta tha <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Aur ab to telugu ache se samajh main bhi aane lagi hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.  <br>He is an emotional guy. He plays pranks with everyone so many people say to him so many things. But he do mind things said to him and he can later ask for clarification. This is a very good habit MUX it really sometimes overhaul the relationship, this habit of confrontation. <br>Mux roj niyam se nahata hai,nahne ke baad pooja karta hai aur gayatri mantra likhta hai. Beech main kuch bhi nahin bolta hai. Parantu sab kar chukne ke baad jo samne sabse pahle aadmi dikhta hai use "Bahan" bolta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Best of luck dude for MS and MV <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Hope you get both of them as early as possible.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ninja is the guru of ECE-05,06,07,08. Maine pata nahin kaun kaun se subjects isse padhe hain. Bahut hi humble aur acha insaan hai. Dil ka bahut saaf hai aur hamesha doosron ki madad ke liye tyar rahta hai.<br>Second year main iska aur subroto ka room dophar main hamara adda banta tha. Iske ghar se aanewala khana hamesha  se hi attraction raha hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>He is very enthusiastic about everthing. He plays cricket, volly ball, table tennis football and all at a decent level. Very good in mathmatics too.<br>Acha ab bahut tarif ho gayi. Another of his speciality is his interpretation power. If you are chatting with him and wants to convey your message correctly then may god help you. He will interpret everything from that chat except the correct one.Everything is probabilistic to him. His works are random processes and he himself is a random variable.<br>He believes in planning. If he is going home tomorrow at 9AM then he will leave the college at 8AM, take a bus to Mehndipatnam, drink a juice at International Juice Center, take another bus to koti, will go to karachi bakery to buy fruit biscuits and finally reach the station. Now if he misses the train then it is not his fault!!!<br>A man of priciples he is. If he thinks something is right then only he will do it no matter what everyone is saying about it.<br>All in all, he is a very good teacher. Strong in his concepts, strong in his field. Lovely walon, you are getting a diamond please do not let it shine dim.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Itne sare testimonial! They are the certificate of his popularity in the batch. We have never talked much albeit general talks in the mess. I will remember him for his persistent and responsible attitude towards whatever he considers important. I can not forget the day during felicity when I came to you regarding the issue of prize money for Mystre' event and you listening to me carefully without a whit of smirk on your face that I was expecting due to all the commotion that was already happened. When I went back I had the faith in you that you will look into the matter. And indeed in the end all went right <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>I wish you all the best for your life. Do not forget us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Yuktahaar ke liye itna kaam karne ke liye award milna chahiye tha <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He is coordinator of yuktahaar for 2 years now and he due to him we are getting quality food their.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Tune mera pahla testimonial uda diya par ye le ek aur <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is a very hardworking man. First year main hamari banti nahin thi. Dono hi short tempered hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> to gussa jaldi aa jata tha. Workspace main hum dono ka password change karna, computer share karna, isko guest privileges dekar pareshan karna <img src=Smileys/3.gif />... ab sochta hoon to bas muskura deta hoon.  First year main to isko dekhkar paseena aa jata tha, jab dekho tab library, jab dekho tab library...<img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>Vaise ek baat main sach bataoon, competitions ki tyari karte samay main bhi aisa hi tha <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He is a very emotional man. I can not forget when we all recorded a song for someone he love so much. Us din bahut maja aaya tha <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>Second year main mujhe lagta hai ki ninja ki vajah se main, adi aur akash group ke anya sadasyon ke sampark main aaye. Hum logon se probability to hilti nahin thi tab ninja aur saurav hi assignment tipate the <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Tabhi saurav se baat tabhi jyada baat honi shuru hui.<br>Coming to final year now I know that I can say anything to him and he will not piss off. Because now he understands me <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Ya jyada se jyada kah dega... "Tau tum....". Isne jis tarah se Renaissance-07 manage kiya tha that was commendable. Gajab ki baat to yeh hai ki Bharat aur isne co-ordination se kaam kiya <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Abke tune testimonial udaya to dekh liyo <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is a guy that has learnt many new things in the college. We used to live in GHEB together. I remember his learning Guitar. I used to go to his room and listen to guitar sometimes. He refined his skills and became an indispensable part of Music club(later co-ordinator of the Music Club). He knew Tabla even before coming to IIIT and he played that during the visit of President APJ <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is the co-founder of IIIT's rock band Avant-garde(did I spell it right?). He also sings  and I really relished the song "Dooba-dooba" sang by you in 119. All in all I can say that if there is an award of "Musical discovery of IIIt" it would go to DVD(that is some of us call him) this year.<br>He is good in Maths and technical. I remember his tutorial session during exams in his room. Once we had this Maths-II end sem and we studied together in my room. We studied all night long and slept at dawn. That was one memorable experience.<br>He is simple by heart and slightly less self confident. This things makes him vulnerable to bad habits. Dude you are very good and very talented. Use your mind rather than letting other influence you when deciding something.<br>All the best. Capital IQ has found a multi-talented person. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I can never forget my days of GRE. I used to be very tense at that period due to too much of workload. I had my GRE in October and when the college starts in August, he came back from Bangalore completing his intern. He used to come to my room innocently search for Barrons and used to ask words non stop. The only respite I had that he had given me the exemptions of selecting word lists I want to give tests from <img src=Smileys/13.gif />!!!<br>Really his support in those days was commendable. I had my center in Bangalore, he asked me if he should go with me and I said that it would be comforting for me if he could go. We went there(in sleeper, although he had a pass but I did not want to spent money on AC). Those were the tough times and I will never forget what you did for me in those days. <br>All the best.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Prateek is a very humble person. His work in Samvedna is commendable. He is the person, from which sometimes I take inspiration. So much social work he does when he himself is not very sure about his future is really inspirational. He always seems so composed in every situation. He has so many friends thanks for his multi-lingual skills. He fits almost everywhere. <br>He is good at studies. Prateek, did you tell everyone that how impress RAMU IS with you and Mr. Sharma <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He is the creative guy of our group and he is using it in a good way.<br>All the best for your future. I will always be your friend.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He never takes too much tension. (Almost) Everything is "lite theeko anna" for him. Iske room masti center hai hamare group la. Kuch na kuch pakta hi rahta hai. Jane kaun kaun se log room par aate hain iske. First year, second year, third year sab aate hain. 2-2 ghanta baith kar bhi jate hain. <br>Iski kuch cheezain meri aaj tak samajh main nahin aayin. Yeh kabhi ghoomne kyon nahin jata? Yeh kabhi apne sentiments show kyon nahin karta? Haan yeh bahut cool hai par ise bhi acha bura agta hai. Par ye kabhi batayega nahin. Iske dimag main kya chal raha hai kisi bhi cheez ko lekar? Har cheez ko hansi main taal deta hai.<br>First year ke baad kafi time hum logon ne sath main bitaya hai. He is very helping. He has the nerve to teach you a subject from the start even if we had the end semester exam of the subject the next day. <br>Communications ke subject iski aur ninja ki vajah se hi main paas kar paya hoon.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Aaj to tu gaya!!! Bhai ko koi gali nahin de sakta nahin to vo chala jayega. Haan main kuch chand khush-naseebon main se hoon jinko Abhaydaan mila hua hai to thodi liberty mil jati hai. Aajkal luck acha chal raha hai bande ka, number mast aa rahe hain aur hamari taraf akal pada hua hai. <br>Bande ki memory or grasping power ultimate hai. Pahl logic thoda problemetic tha par mere tough <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> logical sawalon ki vajah se vo bhi strong ho gaya hai. <br>Adi ko safai bahut pasand hai. Ek baar ye dhobi ko gande kapde dene gaye to dhobi ki samajh main hi nahin aaya ki ye saaf, tah kiye hue, pressed kapde lekar kyon aaye hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif />? Room aisa lagta hai ki kal hi liya ho to poora saaf karaya hai.<br>Iske dost kam hain kyonki ye jyada baatcheet nahin karta. <br>Doston ke liye har kaam karne ko tyar ho jayega haan kitne time main yeh is baat par depend karta hai ki apke chehre aur awaz main kitni urgency hai. By default answer NO hi rahta hai meri tarah <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>"Main Adi DVD bhandar" kholne ka plan hai iska Ludhiana main. Uske liye second year se collection bana raha hai.<br>Adi, Akash, Harh and myself hum log first year se saath hain. Adi Finance Council main hai aur kisi ne IIIT main abhi tak isse acha finance nahin sambhala. Yeh project ke liye ghar se jaldi nahin a sakte par hisab karne ke liye inhe jaldi aana tha ek baar <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>Bhai, MS ki taraf bhi nazr-e-inayat karo. Ek saal bacha hai, prof ko pakdo thode apne busy schedule main se time nikalkar research karo. Aur suno jab paper likho to second author main mera naam bhi dalna. All the best to you dost.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bhai, bande main dimag hai. Haan ab dimag thoda tilt ho gaya hai(pata hi hoga kyon <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) par volume to utna hi hai. <br><br>He is very generous. He purchased a public conveyance for his personal use!!! He is opposite of me. He can not say "NO" to too many people  and I can not say "YES" to people I do not like. He is my argument partner. We fight a lot. Most of the time when I rebuff on some of his statement. But I think he is generous to forget and we still talk normally the next day, or the next to next day, or the next to next to next day.<br><br>Bahut hi alsi hai. No interest in walking until and unless the route is centrally air-conditioned with sub-way on either sides <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Plays no other <br>sport other than TT kyonki "SAY NO TO SWEAT", paseena aa jayega to nahana padega and that violates the first statement of paragraph.<br><br>He is good in public relations but he does not want to be a HR manager. I guess everyone of us facing the same problem It is the high time we all should start thinking what we really want to be, irrespective of what other people think about that. But I know he can do good in any profession. It is the question of 90% or 100%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met this guy on my very first day at IIIT-H. I guess he did not understand my name the first time[<img src=Smileys/14.gif />]. We were from neighboring places so we decided to share the room. First year was tough for me and cool for him. In those tough days of coding he was the only guy in the lab who used to debug my codes [<img src=Smileys/77.gif />]. Although he was more generous to Adi  but that is a different story. <br><br>He really loves to read [<img src=Smileys/4.gif />]. His daily average was 5 pages per day during the days of first year. Reading work as sedative for him.<br>Though now i guess it has improved quite a bit. But the book is still the same "Harry Potter". <br><br>He is lazy but whatever he does marks his perfection. He is not from CSE but knows coding better than most of those guys. Loves to tweak with electronics gadgets, laptop, mobile anything that has a chip inside. He can solve any problem if it is related to your laptop or coding. <br>"Akash yar PDF main kaise convert karoon isse." Akash bolta hai ,"abe ye converter le le mere paas pada hai, chinese main kuch aata rahega click karta rahio. Install ho jayega <img src=Smileys/1.gif />".<br><br>"Abe mujhe ye algorithm implement karni hai, do din se mara raha hoon, kaise karon?". Bhai bole, "Abe ek for loop laga, iske andar ek while<br>phir ek if condition, andar ek for then finally case lagakar break kar de!!!!". "Thanks akash, code hi de de <img src=Smileys/4.gif />"<br><br>What I think he does not know his strengths. His logic is remarkable. He is too good in solving puzzles, too good in algorithms. Wherever he goes he will succeed.<br>Buddy, we will always be best friends.<br> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
