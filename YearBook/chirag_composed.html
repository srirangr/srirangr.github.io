<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul aka Atal aka Chhaddami.The real cool DUDE of our batch. This multi-talented chap from Rewa is an awesome guitar player (founder of Avant Garde - IIIT rock band), phodu tabla player <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, quite good at basketball and most importantly BC. Bhai bande ne bakar mein Ph.D kari hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Has crossed all limits of BC in this sem and one can find his expert comments almost everywhere, be it in yearbook'09, BC forum, orkut photo albums or ug4 mailing list. <br><br>One of the most memorable moments with him is the batch trip of 2nd year when we composed some awesome vulgar songs and formed the P-band <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. His unique style of playing guitar really made that trip a lot more fun. I enjoy teasing this guy a lot especially on the Chhaddami thing <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and seeing is reaction to that makes it all the more interesting. <br><br>We became friends after the evening basketball sessions in 2nd year. Was one of my first basketball buddies. He really learnt the game quite quickly and is now  one of the best among the batch in this game.  Lots of memories to link with him while playing basketball like - all those small fights over fouls and apologizing each other at the end of play, leofying Bajaj when he is on the losing side <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, his rough style of attacking when he has the ball and not caring a bit about the opponents <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, infinite BC during and after the matches and many more (jo abhi yaad nahi aa rahi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br><br>All in all banda ye bindaas hai. All he best for your future buddy. God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Aur haan abhi-abhi pata chala hai ki bande ko ishq ho gaya hai . To ab hum yahi dua karte hai ki is Chaddami ki aloo chat jaldi se pak jaaye <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Soni - a bindaas guy and a bond mathematician. Came to know about him first when someone told me that a guy had 200+ score in AIEEE maths section and I was all praise for this guy even without meeting him. Got to know more about him when we did the trading domain project in ltrc in summer'07. Was really fun working with this brainy chap and the manner in which we extended a two week project to a two month long one was pretty awesome <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Always has a cute smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> which is good to see. Had a tough time during placements when he was really unlucky to not get placed for almost a week despite clearing every written test, but he never let the spirit die which is indeed commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your future buddy. You will really make it big some day. <br><br>God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Cricket is one thing on which we have done more BC than anything else. Have spent hours discussing shots, stats, records, players and recollecting classic matches almost everywhere, be it in NBH-47, 270s wing, TV room, mess or while walking to class. He is madly in love with this game. At times he gets some of the weirdest and wackiest ideas and even takes the initiative to implement the same. His imagination power is totally out of this world and can really make people around him go rofl <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Completely obsessed with pee-ing from different places and even tried doing the same a lot of times <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br>Friends mean a lot to this guy and is always there for them whenever they need him. Gets a lot sensitive when it comes to friends. In these four years we may not have become as close friends as I thought we should have, but koi na .. Pune hai aage ... picture abhi baki hai mere dost <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. We have had lots of coincidences like first sharing the same room, getting placed on the same day and now a job in the same city. This is what I believe means ... Friends Forever ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Loads and loads of memories to associate with him that I will cherish throughout my life. To name a few - late night BC sessions in 1st sem leofying Chand, cursing Jawahar after every assignment and lab test, imaginary fighting sequence <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, dost incident <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, infinite cricket chats, daaru sabha on 3rd night of Felicity'08, middleware aur BTP mein kaatna <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, discussing scores after aimcats and cursing Maroo and Bhalu for their exceptionally high scores, placements (first 8 days) and us getting placed together on the 9th day and many more.<br>Likhne ko to aur bhi bahut kuch hai, pages bhare ja sakte hai is bande par, lekin ab baat aisi hai ki tum bhi ja rahe ho Pune aur hum bhi aa rahe hai Pune, to aur likhne ki feel nahi aa rahi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Baki to aage bhi likhta rahunga. <br><br>All the best for your future bhai and God bless you! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Most memorable moment</b>- The Club8 outing on 20th March '09 when you and Vibhav you-know-what<img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Pagare aka Pappu aka Pups. My x-roomy and one of my first friends in IIIT. When I got to know first that he is a Bhopali then only I felt ki bhai bande se apni bahut jamegi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Ab in mahashaye ke baare mein aur kya kahe , vo kisi ne sach hi kaha hai - looks can be deceptive and this suits him the best. A cute and childish fella from outside, he is one of the those whom noone would like to mess around with. Extremely good at leofying people around him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> but when someone tries to do the same with him he will reply back with double intensity in an angry tone aur lene wale ki phat leti hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>Ab bhai bande ke talent ke baare mein kya kahe, isme to talent bhara pada hai. A good dancer, a phodu bowler, good leadership skills (great job in Felicity'08 cult. part), a decent orator, even good at writing blogs (though hasn't given much try to it) and an absolute genius when it comes to maths <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He was sure to become Mr. Fresher had he not done the last minute stupidity on stage.<br><br>A total BCbaaz and gets the sole credit for making NBH-47 - the BC room it was. Quite good at convincing people and can change their 'yes' to 'no' or vice-versa in almost no time. Even enjoys giving nicks to people, really a master at that and solely responsible for damaging the image of some of his friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Has this really weird habit of keenly observing and judging people right from the first time he meets them and then changing his opinion about them quickly. At once instance he will praise someone with all his heart and make him a hero and and at the very next instance the same person will become a zero in his eyes if he does a slight mistake. One advice that I would like to give you is to give up this habit and stop comparing others with yourself because everyone is different and unique in their own way.   <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mathur aka laal-peela <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The most bindaas guy of our group. Bhai banda MS kar raha hai lekin saale ko kabhi kaam karte hue nahi dekha <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bag lekar ghoomta hai lekin usme bhi bas 1 mouse, taki moka milne par kahi bhi CS khelna chalu ho jaaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Sitcoms, movies, CS, TT aur BC yahi iski life hai. He is the second Tinka of our batch. Hamesha kahi na kahi ghoomta mil jaega. Easily mingles with almost every group and one of the friendliest guys around. Got to know him when he became a part of our group. Most of our interaction took place initially while taking meals. He was one of my Yuktahaar buddies. Me,Pappu,Mota and Budhdha had a lot of fun leofying him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> during those meals in yuktahaar. <br>One of his peculiarities is the way he turns red now and then. Girgit ki tarah rang badalta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Bhai ko hamesha lagta hai ki iska kat raha hai, pata nahi kyu <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Tension na liya kar yaar, tera koi nahi kaat sakta mathure. A total nocturnal and has one of the most wierdest sleeping times. Quite good at playing TT and a bond when it comes to CS. A decent dancer(Vayu ka heera <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), though haven't seen him doing that for a long time. One of the leanest fellow in our batch who has made lots of futile attempts to gain some mass but all of no use <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Always has a cute smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and lightens the atmosphere around him. Isko dekhkar kabhi serious hone ki feel hi nahi aati <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>Some memories associated with him are - all those meals in Yuktahaar leofying you <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, playing basketball in 2nd year, Goa trip in Dec'07, preparing for SE(role-play part <img src=Smileys/24.gif />) and EPP presentation, the booze party given by juniors when you cried <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> and said some senti things to me, the volleyball match near CS when you got totally frustrated on losing <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and then pulled everyone's cheek and a lot more.<br><br>All in all he is one of my good friends in IIIT and really pure at heart.<br><br>All the best for your MS bro. God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 4</b><br>Lots of memories to associate with him in these four years that I will cherish throughout my life like - leofying him during late night BC sessions in NBH-47 in 1st sem <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, TB creation in your room, sleeping during GDs listening to Mitra ki bakwaas, teasing him for 4 countinous hours in summer'07 <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, helmet incident <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, Goa trip in Dec'07, booze party on 3rd night of Felicity'08, BTP mein kaatna <img src=Smileys/1.gif />, last diwali at your house, club8 outing in March'08 when I said something I shouldn't have, all the booze sessions and a lot more.<br>Thanx a lot Chandu for being such a wonderful friend. Socha tha B'lore mein saath machaenge lekin koi na, milte rahenge. <br>Bhai ko kabhi bhoolna mat <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your future bro. God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Most memorable moment</b> - Definitely the helmet incident in summer'07 <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br>Quite good at acads as well, really hard working and CG conscious. One must see him studying a night before exams. He is so much involved that he won't even look at you when you enter his room. Bahut serious ho jaata hai exam time. Midsems mein marwaega lekin end sem phod ke aaega <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Rota bhi bahut hai saala <img src=Smileys/20.gif />, especially when it comes to acads. Banda exam ke pehle roega, exam ke baad roega, grade aane par roega. Kaatne mein bhi expert hai saala <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Have given a lot of BTP vivas and presentations with him and the ease with which he handles situation, bhai manna padega. Always uses the phrase 'means...samajh raha hai na' <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> after every other word while answering some query and the person who asks him anything gets totally confused after hearing his explanation and simply nods making him belive isne phod diya <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>One of the biggest bewda and suttebaaz of our batch. Master of bottoms up, bhai daroo to pani se tez peeta hai lekin saale ko kabhi chadti nahi. Always ready to give his expert fundes about life after getting drunk, mann to karta hai botal maro <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Extremely good at leofying people <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and comes up with really wacky imaginations about them. But when it comes to leofying him banda bahut jaldi irritate ho jaata hai, though somehow manages to hide that behind his stupid fake laughter <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Aur bhai apne saath to kuch alag hi rehta hai, whenever I try  to leofy him he tries to supress me with the show of his muscle strength, isliye aajkal iski lene mein sabse jyada phatti hai, pata nahi kab muh tod de <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Goes really blank at times (Raman types) which is fun to watch <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. <br>Anger is something which you would not associate Chand with <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. It is a very rare sight to see him angry but when he does...bhagwan bachaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Thankfully I have never been on the receiving end and hope never to be.  <br>Always ready to help his friends in any situation. Whenever you are in need you can always count on him. Gave me a lot of encouraging speeches before CAT and placements which really gave my confidence a boost<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>One unique thing about him is that he is supremely confident in even the worst of situation. Even optimism will be a very small word when we talk of his level of confidence. Seeing his confidence in really tough times, even makes people around him start feeling the same. But one thing that I would like to advice you is that confidence is good only upto a limit but when in turns into over-confidence and then when you lose it hurts even more. So beware of that.<br><br>The Neta of our batch or I would say our college.  Right from security guards to students to faculties, har kisi ke saath unlimited BC kar sakta hai and everyone is open to discuss their problems with him which he handles easily. Can be <br>diplomatic a lot of times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and ultimately sabko khush rakh leta hai. One will never find him in his room except for his sleeping hours. Always involved in some or the the other issues be it related to friends, bachmates, juniors or college. The amount of selfless work that he has done for this college is really commendable, be it as a house captain, parliament speaker or pseudo Felicity coordinator <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>BCbaaz to shuru se hi hai. How can I forget those days of first year when he used to come to NBH-47 for the late night BC sessions. Me and Pappu used to leofy him a lot  <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> everytime hoping he won't come the next day lekin saala roz marwane aa jaata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. BCing with him that time was just like listening all about Chand. He never got tired boasting about himself and was  irritating a lot of times. But since then he has changed a lot.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Chand. Writing a testimonial for this guy is definitely one of the most difficult task for me mainly because there is so much to write about him and already so much has been written about him that I have no idea from where I should begin. <br>Hmmm .... the story of our friendship goes back to the initial days of ragging period. I entered a room filled with seniors and him. Back then he was a typical bengali bhondu <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> who was fat, had worst dressing sense and wore thick glasses.  We were asked to abuse each other. I went on and on and this guy was totally numb, had nothing to say whatsoever. But then he suddenly asked me to stop and uttered those three magic words - WTF <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> for the seniors and went out in rage <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.I was really <br>amazed to see the audacity of this guy <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. At that time I thought I hurt him and wanted to apologize but din't get a chance. The very next day he came to my room and started talking to me in a very friendly manner as if nothing happened the previous day and hence we became friends. And his becoming Mr.Fresher after that incident was really commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>Ab banda Mr.Fresher bana tha to talented to hoga hi. Is really good at dancing(Ari-Ari), acting (mimicry mein to bond hai ), sketching and a lot of other things which people have mentioned before and so I won't elaborate. Also a dedicated body builder who loves showing his muscles whenever he gets a chance <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is not a regular gym goer but when he does go, it is more like a ramp walk for him showcasing his muscles in front of every mirror, receiving compliments from people around and laughing in his own silly way <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.  Really good at managing things and relations around him, be it family, friends, acads, extra-curricular and or anything else. Matlab banda sab kuch karta hai aur bahut prem se karta hai which is really awesome <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Greatly fond of numbers and loves playing around with them, even while he is drunk <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Can do even the toughest of calculations in no time. Travel with him roadside and one can find him playing with numbers on number plate of vehicles and is fun to watch. Testimony to his love for maths are his exceptionally high scores in quant section of aimcats. Even managed to get a call from IIM-L without any preparation for CAT which is indeed commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Loves his music esp. Beatles and listens to a wide genre of songs from old hindi to hard rock.<br>Restless to the core and is very much curious to know about each and everything around him. A total nocturnal and a big time lazy. No matter how hard you knock his door during his sleeping hours, he won't care to get up and open it.  If by chance he wakes up, most of his conversations with other people takes place with his lying on the bed and others standing outside his room shouting through his window. One of the biggest suttebaaz and bewda our batch. Saale ko daroo kabhi chadti hi nahi, kitni bhi pila do <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Lots of sweet memories to associate with him in the past four years like - outing on Dusshera in 1st sem, his bhukkad style of pizza slices in pizza hut during Ramzan offer in 2nd year, endless BC sessions in NBH-47, infinite cricket chats praising Sachin, Goa trip in Dec'07,  Halo - typical Bhalu istyle <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, Kal ho na ho - har ghadee badal rahi hai .... again the Bhalu style <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, daroo sabha on 3rd night of Felicity'08, swimming sessions in Feb'09 and many more.<br><br>All in all Bhalu has been one of my good friends in IIIT. All the best for your future bro. Ivy mein macha dena hamesha ki tarah <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br><b>Fav. Memory</b> - The BC we did  on the entrance to Haveli after getting drunk in Club8 and cursing every single waiter that passsed by <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><b>Message for him</b> - Please thoda kum bol kar yaar please <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Bhalu. One of the first memories associated with him is the ragging period when one of the seniors asked me to find Himank Sharma and bring him to them. Since I was not aware who he was, they gave me a hint that the restless guy from your batch who goes on speaking and biting his nails. And as I reached NBH entrance, there he was BCing his usual way with some of our batchmates and irritating them. Back then he appeared a total ch***** to me <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. But as I got to know him more that image transformed into a totally opposite one. But one thing that still remains the same about him is unique style of irritating people around him. This was of the reasons why I used to avoid talking to him during the first year, banda sir mein dard kara deta tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br>The guru of multitasking who is always busy doing 4-5 activities a time and each one with perfection, wonder how <img src=Smileys/7.gif />.  Still remember those tutes in Shashank's room in first year when this guy used to just sit around with cellphone in his hand, busy SMSing people. Everyone used to get frustrated by his acts and I felt banda bahut hero banta hai, jab saale ki paper mein lagegi tab akkal aaegi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But still he was the one who understood more than anyone out there and paper mein fod ke aata tha.<br>Has immense love for blogging. Loves writing about anything and everything around and even promoting his blog by any possible means <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. One of the few who have kept the blog culture alive in our campus and even made attempts to encourage the juniors to do the same. A total BCbaaz who loves speaking and speaking. Cricket is one thing on which we had done more BC than anything else. Those swimming sessions in Feb'09 when we used to get so much involved discussing about cricket that we used to completely forget that we were there something else. When I put Bhalu and cricket together how can I forget to mention his obsession for Sachin. He is simply crazy about the little master. Don't even dare to speak against Sachin in front of him, he might even kill you for that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>Some memories associated with you that I will cherish throughout my life are - The outings in 1st sem to Pizza Hut, Prasads,Koti,  endless BC sessions in NBH-47, movies on your lappy in 2nd sem, dance party in your wing in 2nd year, numerous tutes that you have taken in 2nd and 3rd year and during placements, Goa trip in Dec'07, booze session on 3rd night of Felicity'08 , club8 outings, all the help you have given me during placements and many more.<br><br>Wish you all the success in the future bro and hope all your dreams come true <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. <br>God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br><b>Fav. Memory</b> - All those advice that drunk Adi gave me in club8 in March'09.<br><b>Message for him</b> - Get over your laziness, especially when you know ki tera katne wala hai.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Never seen him getting emotional, even after getting drunk and stays very balanced all the time. But then there is always the daroo exception. Drunk Adi is a lot different from the normal one. He has so much more to talk to, so much advice to give to others and is really great to hang out with. Will always remember all those valuable advice you gave me in club8 in March'09 (don't remember the date <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and hope to implement them in the next phase of my life.<br><br>Has very clear fundes in life and knows exactly what to do so as to acheive his target. Very few around here have such clarity in their thoughts about their future career as this guy has and I know that he will make it big someday. A total brainy and extremely good at acads. Sleeps half of the time while attending any lecture and still in the end understands everything (wonder how <img src=Smileys/7.gif />)  and even has some doubts to ask as well. Got intern and PPO in Microsoft which is indeed <br>a commendable feat <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Also to mention is his obsession for MS and its products.  Madly in love with cars (his wishlist tells the same) and travelling with him along the Banjara, Jubilee side one can see him spotting different brands of cars and discussing them with Ganja. <br><br>Though aalsi a lot of times, even when he knows ki iska katne wala hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But the dedication with which he worked as a placement coordinator clearly belies the 'Aalsi' phrase associated with him and most of us were really amazed to see him <br>working day and night during placements. This is for your great job as a placement coordinator <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .<br>Always there for his friends when they need him and help in the best possible way he can. Helped me a lot after my accident on last Holi. Thanx a ton for that and for everything else you have done for me in these four years <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Adi aka Aalsi. He is one of the first friends that I made in IIIT. Still remember the days of our first year when He, Maroo and me used to hang out together. Back then he was very shy and reserved but when he opened his mouth it was all gyaan and no bakwaas . BC was something unknown to him at that time. But these four years have changed him a lot in some aspects.<br> <br>One of his core qualities is his never ending thrust for knowledge. The 'Mobile Wikipedia' or 'Mr. I-Know-It-All' of our batch has that much gyaan in his brain which any single human can get inside him and still has that inquisitiveness to know more. Be it technology, politics, economics, sports or any other field he has something or the other to contribute to it. The most sophisticated guy of our batch , machaate hue kabhi nahi dikhega <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is a gentleman in the true sense.<br>But one thing where his sophistication somewhat vanishes is when he hears rock. An avid rock fan and one of those guys who has still kept the rock culture alive in our college. The first time I got a taste of rock was on the rock night of Felicity'06 and I was quite surprised to seem him going wild doing hand-banging. He introduced rock music to our group and me and Pappu used to play tracks from Metallica, Maiden, Sabbath, GNR in full blast in NBH-47 as suggested by him. Even attended some gigs with him in OFD, X-bar, Durgam Cheru which were really memorable. Worked with all his heart for Felicity'08 rock night and played a key role in making it the best rock night in Felicity ever <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>He is shy initially but once he opens up he is a totally different bloke. Quite mature and really thinks a lot about people. Even quite particular about noticing minute niceties of others from their dressing sense to their behaviour and habits. But this can sometimes be irritating as well for the one who is being targeted . </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>DJ Ranga. The first image that comes to my mind after hearing this name is the ever smiling cute little fella <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The most bindaas guy of our batch whom I have never seen getting tensed or angry over anything at all and handles every situation with his bubbly nature. <br>The one thing that really brought us closer was the Batch trip in Dec'07. Before that he was just another guy from the batch who was friends both with the people from north and south. But seeing his energy and enthu while composing songs for the P-band and his extremely friendly nature I felt like banda to apne type ka hi hai, apni isse bahut jamegi. Most memorable moment during that trip would be his abrupt ending of the song 'Chandu ke chahcha (p-version)' which made all of us <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . <br>Another incident that is still fresh in my mind is the booze session on 3rd night of Felicity'08. He was probably the only non-drunkard among the whole lot there and was a bit scared seeing people do some wacky things out there. Still remember the expressions on his face when I asked him to try the RDB-style from roof top, he was like WTF ! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Was an awesome experience teasing him that night. But thanx Range for handling that situation calmly and sorry if I had said anything offensive to you that night. <br>A total BC baaz and quite a good singer. His Masakali performance during Felicity'09 was fun to watch <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. A mobile library of songs and movies, just name any song or movie and he will come up with complete details of it which is indeed commendable. <br>Lots of memorable moments with him in these four years like - Batch trip in 2nd year, midnight snacks in his room watching movies like One Two Three, swimming sessions in Feb, the frequent Hi and Bye that we exchange from our respective wings, antakshari in 270s wing and many more.<br>It feels great to have such a nice, cute and dear friend like you<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>All the best Range for your future. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Fav memory - Booze session on 3rd night of Felicity '08<br>Message for him - Always remain the ever smiling Ranga we know <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>A complete movie freak and is always ready to do BC on it . A few days back when I told him that haven't seen Rocky to ye banda poora senti ho gaya <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and cursed me a lot for that. Has read around 500+ novels and quite good at narrating stories as well, especially if the story is about his village, some fights or has some horror element in it. <br><br>Inspite of many good qualities and all the smartness that he has, he doesn't carry himself well. Won't take bath for days, bhangi saala <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and his room stinks like hell. Room kholta hai to poore wing mein badboo faila deta hai. The most funny part to look for are his hair with each in a different direction <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and appears more like a comic character. <br>His anger is completelty uncontrollable <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> though it is a very rare sight. Got to experience that for the first time in Goa when he had a fight with some local guy there. He can literally kill someone when he is angry.<br><br>Always there for helping his friends whenever they need him and even ready to fight for them. <br>Some sweet memories associated with him that I will always remember are - grand outing in 1st sem, his debugging my assignments in workspace, BC sessions in NBH-47 and 270s wing, Goa trip in Dec'07, puzzle solving sessions before placements, the joy on his face when he is about to eat some delicious food <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and many more.<br><br>All the best for your future. Keep rocking in B'lore and shake the city to its core. <br>God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav Memory</b> - Goa trip in Dec'07<br><b>Message for him</b> - Get out of your room and start enjoying the real life.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>PK - the first thing that comes to my mind after hearing this name is Food <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Have met a lot of people before who are passionate about many things but haven't seen someone who is so passionate about eating like this guy. For his love for food I will just say 'Iske liye saari duniya 1 taraf aur khana 1 taraf'. There are umpteen number of incidents relating him and food in these four years and I guess pages can be written on them but I prefer to skip them for now.<br><br>Got to know him first during our ragging period but at that time our interaction was limited to just Hi and Bye. But once our gang was formed it was really fun hanging out with him. In the first three years we saw less of each other, except for some outings or BC sessions, which was mainly because of the proximity factor. But with him moving to our wing this year I got to know more of him. <br>The Sitcom King of our batch, he prefers to stay aloof alongwith his lappy  in his room for almost the entire day  watching sitcoms and comes out only during meals. Just give him lots of food and his lappy and he will remain in his room forever. Has an excellent memory when it comes to remembering dialogues of some sitcoms and will say them word by word with perfection. Does get excited sometimes about things around him due to which he got the knick 'Joshi' (coined by Pappu) <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Comes up with some  really wacky ideas of doing some things but never actually takes the initiative to do the same and all that excitement fades away in no time. <br><br>Has oodles of unutilized talent inside him. Like he can be a good public speaker and a decent basketball player (even used to play this game ages ago) but his laziness takes the better of him always. A total brainy, especially when it comes to coding and solving puzzles. Has a carefree attitude towards acads but worked with complete dedication and determination during placements and got one of the best jobs in our batch which is indeed commendable <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Gets angry very easily <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> but instead of showing his anger he prefers to remain silent. Just leofy him once and he will enter into his famous 'silent mode' <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> and won't utter a word for hours. Considers himself really mature, more like a dadaji <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and always ready to give his expert comments and fundes.<br>Helped me a lot on the last Holi after my accident by carrying me to the hospital, even though he didn't fully recover from the Bhang effect. Thanx a lot Budhdhe ! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Will always remember him for - the way he cries after getting drunk <img src=Smileys/20.gif />, his keep-my-room-clean syndrome, his silent mode, Holi 2008, bike accident in front of the college gate <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .<br><br><b>Fav. memory</b> - Booze in Goa on the first night, was a first time experience for both of us and was simply awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><b>Message for him</b>- Learn to talk</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br>Vipul aka Budhdha has always remained a mystery to me. Speaks so less that I have never understood what is there on his mind <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Got to know him in first year as Raman's silent roomy who prefered cleanliness over anything else. Though people say he has changed a lot in these four years but for me he is the same as was back in the first year, a very quiet fella. <br><br>Our relationship in these four years hasn't changed much. Still our conversations are limited to just casual greetings to one other except on some special ocassions. Sometimes his silent attitude can be irritating as well especially when you are willing to talk and he is very much unintereted to even listen to you. It is more of a monologue while conversing with him. You go to his room, speak for 5-10 mins and all you got in reply is a yes, a no or a hmmm. This is where I think he needs to change. Learn to talk more.<br><br>Cries a lot for every small thing, rotlu saala <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Gets too much emotional when he is drunk and sheds his tears <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> like some typical saas-bahu soap character. Never seen him laughing once when he is drunk. He is one of those guys who really is not a social kind of person and just sticks to his 4-5 close friends. Rarely  interested in doing BC with others. Even forms opinion about people quickly and then sticks to them no matter what. A little advice that I would like to give him is to start seeing things and people from different angle as well.<br>The most systematic guy in our group who keeps his room clean like hell. One can find all day-to-day stuff orderly arranged in his room and his room acts more like a storehouse for others in his wing. One of the best traditional dancers in IIIT. His latke-jhatke on 'nain lad jai hai' is fun to watch <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>Lots of sweet memories associated with him in these four years like - grand outing in 1st sem, RR incident, BC sessions in NBH-47, 12 July 2006, coke(cock) incident in Alligator <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, DBMS project, PT in summers after 2nd year, his crying even before getting any b'day bumps, NIFT incident <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, sleeping in recursion <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, vision 2020, the joy on his face jab ye pappu ki leta hai (which is very rare though <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), his peeking through the window of my room to see if I am watching the stuff, THE kand with Pappu last month <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, last club8 outing when he assumed the beer mugs to be dumbles and started working out using them. There a lot more to add to this list but I am unable to recollect now.<br><br>Thanx a lot RJ for all the entertainment, help and support that you have given me in these four years.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>All the best for your MS and your future . Hope you complete your MS by next year.<br>God bless you ! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav memory</b> - I won't write here but I think you know <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><b>Message for him<b> - Think twice before you speak but don't lose confidence.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Lazy to the core, but all that laziness vanishes when he receives a mail from Jawahar <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Inspite of all the BC that he does, he somehow manages to please Jawahar and complete his work on time. There is a complete change in his behaviour when he does his MS work, gets quite serious and enters into a silent mode with all his focus on his work. Never imagined a guy like him doing MS in CVIT (esp. under Jaws) but now seeing him work I feel that he will complete his MS on time.<br><br>He is definitely the undisputed champion when it comes to doing 'Kands' <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Not a day passes when there isn't something hilarious about him to speak of. Looking back at all these years I must say a complete book can be written about all his famous Kands. I wish I had video recorded all the famous acts he did in these years and I bet that would have been better than any sitcom ever made. With his presence in the wing there is a different atmosphere altogether.One can see other wingmen listening to his latest deeds and rolling on the floor laughing after that <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>Inspite of all the fun that we had in these past four years, he is one of those guys with whom I had the most number of fights, sometimes for some really weird reasons. But the best part is just within hours after our little skirmish one of us <br>initiates the conversation and things are again back to normal and the bond of our friendship even more stronger. He is one of those guys who never thinks before speaking and says whatever comes to his mind without caring about the consequences. A lil piece of advice that I would give him is to think twice before you say anything to anyone because you may be taking it in a joking manner but it might hurt feelings of others. Everyone has certain limits and you should beware not to cross them.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Raman aka RR aka Sotla. Got to know him in first year through Daddu and looking at his abnormally thin built made me feel he was a survivor of some concentration camp <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Back then he used to visit our room a lot and me and Pappu had sheer fun <br>leofying him <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. A total bindaas guy who never cares about things much and takes them in a very light manner. Never seen him getting emotional over anything at all. He is a victim of constant bullying by a lot of people of our batch and he rarely feels bad about it. <br> <br>His obsession with sleeping is indeed amazing. 'Duniya mein kisi ne kisi se itna pyaar nahi kara hoga jitna ye sone se karta hai' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Can sleep almost anytime and anywhere , even while standing in a bus. Hats off to his passion for sleeping <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Becomes really dumb at times when given to process a lot of information in a very short time and comes with some hilarious replies <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Even goes blank at times <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> when things go totally over the top of his head and thus got the knick - Mr. Blank.<br><br>Quite good at playing TT but never plays to his potential in inter-house or inter-batch matches. Even has a good voice which he showcases through singing in the wing but is overshadowed by the way he messes up the lyrics and is fun to watch <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Can't sing the same line twice with the same lyrics, always has something more to contribute to it. From time to time there comes a josh in him to go for body building and comes to my room and says - 'yaar chike ... ab se roz 4 ghante gym, 2 ghante subah, 2 ghate shaam, kya bolta hai '. But all this enthusiam subsides in the blink of an eye. A 'chuimui' who has almost zero tolerance power and makes a rotlu face <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> even when someone pats him lightly. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Has immense passion for photography and takes some really nice pics. Just give him a camera in any situation and his magic clicks will produce some really beautiful snaps. The enthusiasm with which he worked as a coordinator of Photography Club and organized those photowalks was commendable. Also did a great job in Felicity'08 in Kalakshetra and the campus decoration part <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br>He is one of the founding members(along with Mota) of the constant machaana in our wing <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Has really loud voice, a loud speaker I must say and when he shouts the voice keeps echoing in hostel for hours and sounds more like an Aakashwani. Doesn't need a phone to talk to his family members, his voice is enough. Always ready to do BC and even crack some really weird phattes which no else can really make out <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Does get angry sometimes when someone tries to give him bumps and responds with his famous line 'Dhar ke dunga' <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. A person who is really pure at heart and never keeps ill-feeling against someone. <br>Quite mature and knows exactly what to say to whom so as not to hurt anyone.<br><br>We have had lots of memorable moments in college like basketball matches in evening, little skirmishes on court over some fouls, numerous outings (especially in October in 1st sem), BC sessions in NBH-47 and 270s wing, attending Literature and CAT classes in 6th sem (Bhaagooo ..... <img src=Smileys/21.gif />), composing songs in his room in 7th sem (Badhal Ganj se aaya Ganja ... dhik-chik dhik-chik dhaye-dhaye <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ), placements, club 8 outings (kela incident) and many more.<br><br>It feels really great to have a friend like you.

<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Shrikant aka Ganja aka 'Aksay' Kumar aka Nagraj aka SNS .... and the list goes on . Vaise to hai iske naam anek fir bhi ye hai hazaaro mein ek <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>In the first sem he was just a guy from Gorakhpur living in cellar who was Shashank's roomy. At that time we had very few conversations and that too were mainly when we went for an outing or while playing basketball. But with us sharing the same wing after coming to OBH we got to know more of each other and the bond of our friendship became stronger.  <br>Was one of my first basketball buddy. He learnt this game after coming to college and now I must say he is quite good at it (especially faking his opponents). A total bindaas guy who never worries about things much, especially acads and one can see him going for marathon movie sessions just a day before exams. <br><br>He is the one guy in our group who is being made fun of the most <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and he never feels bad about it. Always has a smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> which is really good to see. Probably has more nicknames (around 25 when we counted the last time) than any other person of our batch and his t-shirts, hair density and most importantly his tashan have contributed a lot in giving him those names. Considers himself  'Aksay' Kumar (the real action hero) of our batch <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, due to which he hot the knick - Ganja Pandey and has this dream of jumping from one roof top to another of our college buildings. Got a new nick - Hairy-man <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, who uses hair as his superpower and is much stronger than Spider-man.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>Loads of memory associated with him in these four years. Some memorable moments still fresh in my mind are - dost incident in 1st year <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, BC sessions in NBH-47, attending an unknown marriage in Durgam Cheru when he played the part of Rahul to perfection, dancing in some random marriage procession, ITWS-3 project (beeja di shakti) with him working and pappu, bansi and me leofying him <img src=Smileys/21.gif />, daroo sabha after Felicity'08 (RDB ishtyle), rain dancing during last summer, his constant machaana in THE wing in 7th sem, last club8 outing when he performed the hip rotation dance <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, DB tutes during placements, memory games and nite outs in train while returning from Bhopal and many more. <br><br><b>Fav memory</b> - The club 8 outing last month when he laughed and danced continously for 3 hours without uttering a word <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><b>Message for him</b> - Don't get so emotional and thoda roya kum kar.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>A total brainy  and a bond coder. Still remember how he debugged my assignments in first year with such an ease. Transformed into a total studious guy <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> in the 3rd and 4th sem when he got the title 'Guard of the reading room '. Was really unlucky to get a F in DB due to a small mistake when he clearly deserved an A. Really worked with all his heart for the placements and got the highest package in the batch which was a really great feat <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>He also has this hobby of making sisters. Sees a sister in almost every girl that he interacts with but still has made a gf which is really hard to believe and still puzzles many of us <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. Went on his first date to a temple and his idea of a <br>perfect honeymoon is visiting all the four dhams <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Considers himself a romantic superstar due to which he got the nick - Romantic Khan <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Very emotional kind of person who is always there for his friends whenever they need him. Was really motivating when I used to get frustrated during placements. I never hesitate to ask for his help whenever I need it and he is always there to lend a helping hand. Still curses me for ruining his last Holi when he and Maroo actually saved my life after the accident, carried me to the hospital and stood by me awake all night. Really helped me in every possible way they could <br>have and helped me recover. Sorry and Thanx a lot Mote ! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Piyush aka Mota aka Haathi. The story of our friendship began from the first sem. Though initially I feared him and avoided talking to him due to the way he used to bully people around him. But gradually with his frequent visits to our room to meet Pagare, I came to know more about him and thus began our friendship. And now, I must say,he is the one of those guys whose <br>company I enjoy the most. The main reason being when he is around we always have some laughter sessions <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> over something or the other, be it leofying someone else around or cracking phattes. His sense of humour is really great and is really fun to watch jab ye kisi ki leta hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>Creativity is something inherent in him and from time to time one can see him making some of the awesome sketches. Testimony to the same is the really commendable work he did in Felicity'08, especially the poster designs and the campus decoration part <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Quite a good singer and listening to him singing makes me feel 'iski awaaz mein ek ajeeb sa dard chupa hai' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>A total cry baby <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> who always finds some or the other reasons to cry for, especially a day before the exams and when he cries the most, he scores the most. He simply goes crazy while giving b'day bumps to people and appears like a mad elephant set free in a jungle who is ready to crush whoever comes his way with his heavy feet. But when the time comes to return the favour he starts crying again <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. Another peculiarity of his is his laughing style <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He goes on and on laughing, clapping his hands and moving around and sometimes it irritates the person on whom he laughs at. Always ready to do BC anywhere and on <br>any topic. One thing I really enjoy the most with him is cracking phattes silently in his ears and seeing his reaction to that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>The self control that he exercises is really commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. When people used to watch stuff on Maruti's PC in workspace in 1st year this guy never even bothered to turn back and sincerely did coding sitting just behind that PC. He is the only one in our group who has abstained from drinking alcohol (though his red eyes tell just the opposite tale<img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and I really admire him for that <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br>One more thing about him is that he wants to be a hero. Sometimes passing by his room one can see him dancing with complete actions and emotions on songs from Krissh <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He even gets irritated easily when leofied at <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> which can be easily seen by a change in his way of smiling and by his act of physically suppressing the one who tries to make fun of him. But still everyone around him esp. Bhalu, Budhdha and Maroo enjoy teasing him and watching his reaction to that. Sometimes when he has nothing to BC about he would just pick some random song from some super-flop movie of 90s which one would have not heard since ages and start singing and then everyone around him would be like ... WTF ! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> . He also has some previously formed notions about somethings and sticks to them. Here I would advice him to be little flexible and to see other side of things as well.<br><br>He is really a kid by nature who never keeps ill-feeling  against anyone and really pure at heart. Some of my favourite memories associated with him are - grand outing in 1st sem, BC sessions in NBH-47, dance party in his wing in 3rd sem, Graphics tutes, my accident on last Holi when he stood by me all day long in hospital (thanx a lot for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), OS tutes during placements, phattes in gym (esp. the Metallica one) <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, volleyball near CS and many more.<br><br>Microsoft is really lucky to have you Manish and you will surely take it to new heights.<br>All the best for your future.

<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Manish aka Jaat is one of those guys of our batch who has transformed himself a lot in the past four years. Still remember the good old days of first year when I used to visit Chand and his room, I used to always find him studying and fared not to interrupt so as to provoke his anger. At those times our interaction was just limited to mere 'hi' and 'bye'. But after the formation of TB we got to know each other more and more and now it feels really great to have a friend like him <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>From a studious guy in first year to a total sports freak, this guy has achieved perfection in almost each and every field that he has tried his hand at. I would say he is perfection personified. One must see his attitude towards approaching things. He is never scared of any challenge and hates losing. Has this confidence that he can be the numero uno, which eventually he does through persistent hard work. Be it working out in gym, playing TT, badminton, volleyball, CS, FIFA or public speaking, he has proved his mettle in all. This is for his never say die spirit <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  which has really been inspirational for others.<br><br>Always manages to keep a smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> which is the best part. It's really great to be in his company as he lightens the atmosphere around him with his short phattes <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Initially I used to get irritated a lot with his phattes and felt like I should just seal his mouth but now with him being around and not cracking any PJs it feels like something is lacking. <br>A total brainee, which is quite evident from his academic feats in these four years. Used to study a lot till 2nd year when he realized that whether he studies or not he will end up getting an A/A-. He was our 'crack the interview' during the <br>placements and helped us a lot through the OS tutes and helping in every other possible way he could have.

Memory </b>- Felicity '08 (esp. booze session on 3rd night)<br><b>Message for you </b>- Be more flexible, control your anger and get out of the time-table mode.<br><br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br>The control that he exercies over many things is really remarkable. Never does anything in excess, be it eating, sleeping or some other because he has this fear that this will harm him in some way or the other. But this is where he misses the fun <br>part and I would advice him to stop being so particular about things and just let things go. Does get aggressive a lot, especially during GD or debating and can scare the living hell out of people. He is also adamant at times and it's really impossible to persuade him to do something which he is not willing to.<br><br>Felicity'08, now that is one thing in which I saw him at his best. Being the coordinator he played a pivotal role in making it one of the best Felicity in IIIT till date. He managed each and every aspect of it with such discipline, dedication, enthusiasm and ease that it was worth being a part of it and for that I would just say <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  The time just when we hugged each other and he broke down at the end of Felicity was the most emotional moment associated with him. <br><br>Always there to lend a helping hand to his friends and help them in any situation he can. He is the best example of - A friend in need is a friend indeed. Who else can better understand this than me  especially after the incident on last Holi. He and Piyush were the two people who actually saved my life on that day, stayed awake all night long in the hospital and helped in every best possible way they could have to help me recover. Thanx a lot Maroo for everything <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Talking about his dedication, what can be a better example than his preparation for CAT. It was his passion and worked for it with all his heart. He deserved a lot lot more than what he actually got and I really hope that if he gives it a try again he will surely make it into IIM-A. But still getting through IIM-I is really a commendable feat <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Even durings placements, he deserved to get placed a lot earlier but somehow the luck was not on his side. <br>Speed is one of those qualities which separates him from the rest. Given the speed and enthusiasm with which he performs every task,  be it reading, writing, typing, speaking, eating  makes me believe that he has got some extra energy genes in him. Always full of energy and excitement, he has been a source of inspiration for many around him.<br><br>He also has this immense love for cricket and is simply crazy about it. Made a lot of effort and finally succeeded in being a part of IIIT's bowling attack, though he still has to work a lot on his batting. He also had umpteen BC sessions and debates on cricket in TV room, OBH wing, almost anywhere and everywhere. The Gossip Boy of our batch, always has some or the other happenings in the campus to gossip about and enjoys narrating them with a lot of spice and exaggeration. Hanging out with him is lot of fun as it's easy  to leofy him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and he never feels bad about it and just reponds with his cute smile <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>He is one of those guys who has changed very little since first year. Still has the same enthusiasm and dedication towards any work that he does, be it attending classes, preparing for exams or any other. A total time-table guy I must say. One thing that he really needs to control is his anger <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He does get angry a lot and sometimes for some weird reasons and when he does it's really difficult to face him. Some people are not able to talk to him much mainly fearing his anger and I must say, sometimes I am one of them. So bhai Maroo, thoda gussa kum kara kar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1 </b><br>To write a testimonial for Maroo is really a tough task because there are so many dimensions to cover of this multi-faceted person that it's impossible to put everything into words, but still I will try.<br><br>Madoo or Mr. Perfect as I would like to call him is one of THE ideal person that I have ever some across <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and it feels really great to have found a great friend in him . The all rounder of of our batch who does each and every task with utmost dedication, sincerity and perfection. His time management skills are simply superb and knows exactly how much effort is required in each task to come out with flying colours. Be it CAT, Felicity, acads, cricket, blogging, BC, friendship or any other, he has proved his mettle in all <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>Our friendship  kicked off right from the first year. At first look he appeared a total nerd to me <img src=Smileys/26.gif />. Still remember him wearing those thick glasses as he always does and noting down names of our batchmates right before the English test on the first day as part of some ragging assignment. Pappu and me had a good laugh on his sincerity towards such an unimportant task <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. But from then on our casual greetings turned into friendship in a very short span and had some awesome time together. Some memorable moments of first year are the grand outing in October, giving him bumps in workspace, TB formation, cricket debates in Adi's room, countless BCs in NBH-47 and many more. His knowledge of slangs was really poor at that time and even faced some embarassing moments because of that in workspace which was fun to watch <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He had this time table thing right from first year(Raju time-table) and used to get annoyed if anyone interfered with that. But still I had my slice of fun leofying him on that and sometimes he too enjoyed that. <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
