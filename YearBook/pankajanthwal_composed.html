<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abey bade aadmi, aisi badi baatein nahi kiya karte <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. We can definitely be the best of friends. In fact, for me a friend is someone who can be trusted. And for that matter, I always trusted you so, for me, you've always been a good friend. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>That we have different priorities and have slightly different takes on life is an altogether different issue, but I really don't think what we aim in the long run for ourselves and for the others is drastically different in any way.<br><br>I never tried to handle any ragging cases, just wanted to be friends with the freshers, but guess it all bombed big time <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Well, Karan is a <b> very hard working, extremely dedicated, and even more extremely emotional and sensitive person </b>. Kyon be, theek bola na? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And then of course, the leader and manager that he is, ab tak to gaon gaon mein bachcha bachcha ye baat jaanta hai.. no use rambling about his organizing and managing capabilites. Excellent ra!!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>What appeals to me most about this person is his <b> innocence, simplicity, and very sincere, dedicated and super-emotional self </b>, that reminds me of myself of a few years ago <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> [Only the super-emotional part <img src=Smileys/5.gif />]<br><br>Brilliant at academics <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> [pata nahi kitne log to isey padhte dekh ke complex ke maare hi underperform kar gaye honge], and cricket, abey tu bowler to hai hi badhiya <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, batsman bhi bahut achcha ho sakta hai.. self-belief chahiye bas.. ye meri paarkhi nazar aur nirma super dono ka waada!!! <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Baki yar wo felicity mein tumhari help nahi kar paya kyunki bahut zaada pareshan tha apne issues mein, believe me aur koi baat nahi thi.<br><br>To fir bugge, all the best for future!!! Make sure, you are yourself no matter what the situation is and you will always be a winner. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> And may you attain your ultimate goal <b>to live with continuous happiness and prosperity</b> soon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hey Vipul, I was amazed to see how well you read me and have a feeling that the priorities that kept me away from you people might have denied me some wonderful friends <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Thanx for the nice words anyways. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Well, Vipul dances very well <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> and is quite serious about academics and I think he has done quite well on that account. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Didn't have much opportunity to interact with him in all these years but from now on there is more than required time on hand for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May you always achieve what you aim for, wherever you go. All the best!!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Amazing sportsperson <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> (Vayu's backbone for 4 years in sports <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and a thoroughly professional academician <img src=Smileys/26.gif />, Prafafti <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> is one person I have seen excel in every endeavour that she has undertaken. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> She is someone who never looked perturbed anytime in all these years, and all throughout has been a very calm and composed personality, someone you would always want to resort to when in deep waters. Unfortunately, I never knew her well enough to actually go ahead and take her advice on any matter <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br><br>I have always felt that you are a very sensitive [which is not a weakness <img src=Smileys/4.gif />] person. Be like that always <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>You have a wonderful future ahead <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Go out there, make all the moments count and have a wonderful life from here on <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vrktavva.html>Tavva Rajesh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Rajesh Tavva - besides being batch mates in the same section, we were in the same small group for the English classes. He is such a dedicated, serious, hard working person that if you see him concentrating on something, you'll bet your life on him having never smiled his entire life.<br><br>And then, you see him flash that broad cheerful grin, that bright colgate smile, <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and you think you are looking at a totally different person. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br><br>And then the mimicry artist that he is, a brilliant actor and extremely energetic and expressive dancer, he is very creative, sincere, and original in whatever he does. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>A very dedicated performer, and very sincere and hard-working student, <img src=Smileys/26.gif />, Rajesh is someone who goes to the root of a concept in trying to understand it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And that with all the humility, simplicity and willingness to help everyone who needs him, makes Rajesh an extraordinary human being <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Looking forward to teaming up with you for some more creative fun filled stage performances like the one we did in Felicity '07 <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best in life <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. You are an inspiration dost <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Just one thing, let that colgate smile out more often <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bhanukiran - extremely sensitive, a passionate singer, promising poet, a very talented actor, always ready to take up responsibilities - he was one of my earliest friends in IIIT-H simply for the fact that I could relate to his sensitivity and innocence.<br><br>Quite a simple and uncomplicated person, his poetry works are quite good [I don't know if you keep writing regularly. If you don't, I suggest you start doign that <img src=Smileys/4.gif />] and reflected the intensity and passion that are the characteristics of his personality.<br><br>Bhanu thinks with his heart and is a very caring and gentle person to talk to. Someone, with an uncorrupted mind, someone you could trust to not misunderstand you and even if he misunderstood, would not stop talking to you.<br><br>Very hardworking and equally daring, Bhanu always speaks his heart out and his social life [unlike mine, I know you would want that aspect of me to change. I assure you it will <img src=Smileys/4.gif />] had been very active during last four years. He gave it his best shot whenever it came to doing something for the students. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Wish you all luck, wherever you go Bhanu. Be the passionate, sensitive [believe me, it is not a weakness], innocent Bhanukiran that you've always been <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Popularly known as D.J. Ranga, Sri<b>rang</b> is really a colourful personality and has been like a personification of cheerfulness over the past four years. Not once did I find him gloomy. [I hope you never were, and wish never will be] The pic here speaks all about the person [No matter which pic he uploads, the vibrant energy and the cheerfulness will always be reflected <img src=Smileys/4.gif />]<br><br>He is one of those rare people in college who never misunderstood me and I always felt a soothing calmness about him, something that conveyed to me - <i>"Don't worry, everything will be fine. Look at me, it's not very tough to feel happy, to smile <img src=Smileys/1.gif />"</i>. Thanx for always being there for me as a friend, and for all those encouraging words you spoke to me every time I either was going to perform or had performed on stage and of course for that wonderful testimonial you wrote for me. You are one person whose admiration always encouraged me a great deal <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Bhai Ranga, you have the gift of spreading joy through your ever so charming and refreshingly simple attitude <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Keep putting it to good use as you have been doing for the last four years.<br><br>Aur kya likhun, to summarize it all -- <b> "Humare Pyare Chalte Firte Smiley <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> Hamesha Smile Karte Rehna <img src=Smileys/6.gif />" </b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Tall, (very tall), and cool -> Sunil bhai is one of those few people who I felt never judged me. It's a pitty that we didn't stay in touch very often after the first year. But I remember very well how you had been a very good friend initially during those days <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>I must apologize for that day when I made you wait outside the workspace <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Tall Sunil is very good at sports and speaks very good Telugu and Hindi and of course English. By origin, I think, he is a marwari, though -- multilingual chap <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I remember you enjoyed pulling my leg and calling me a "Kameena", I don't know till date why <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <br><br>A warm guy at the heart, Soni is a wonderful person and friend to be with <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Thanx for all the support, I'll keep looking for it from you in future.<br><br><b>All the best for the future ra!!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> </b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mere pyare dadde, sabse pehle to I must apologize you for doubting you in the past. For all our difference of opinions, I now know you never intended to make me unhappy or win any argument, you always intended to tell me something valuable you knew. <br><br>Abey, 1st year ke baad maine perform hi kahan kiya. Abhi dekh, ho saka to tum logon ke jaane se pehle ek performance ho jayega <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Ok then, Sanket is a witty wily old fox, with the sense of humour that if targeted at you would drown you in embarrasment after knocking you speechless and sometimes it may take you a little while to understand that he is having a go at you. The confirmation comes with a wicked dimpled grin and you know you were being mocked at. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>But, that's the best part of him, no matter how serious the matter is, he would always end it with a smile making you feel that even though there might be a disagreement on opinions, there would never be a strain in the relation <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>A good manager, leader, and public relations maintainer, he has the knack of resolving the most serious of conflicts somehow. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> And that's all most people think of him. Don't know if anyone knows (I doubt even if he himself is aware of the fact) that he is a very sensitive person deep within. He hides it from the world and from himself, for it would portray him as a weak person.<br><br><br>Bas, aur kya kahoon, had the best of days with him initially in the college. Then did not get to share thoughts and time with each other very often. But Dudz, don't you miss those days.. everything will be back, just the way it was.. tere dost ka promise <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br><b> Aur is baar wo Doon ki tarah dhokha nahi dunga. Waada!!! </b> Hamesha aise hi khilkhilata, chamchamata, muskurata, motiyon se daant dikhata, doston ki udaata rahiyo. All the best for future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Milne aa jana kabhi kabhar Bank of America se, main to pada rahunga yahin, Kannan ki god mein. Waise, kahan hai ye bank? America mein? Wahi to nahi jiski wajeh ye sab recession ka lafda hua? <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vivekprakash.html>Vivek Prakash</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bicky baikoob (the way I fondly address him), is, as all other testimonials of his suggest, a mean green technical machine. Genius personified!!! <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>I always believed there were two kinds of students in this world - one who go to the core to understand a concept at its roots, and one who are produce the brilliant results, fast and furious. And then I met the third kind - bicky the great, he goes to the root of any concept, makes sure he doesn't stay there, comes back and produces wonderful results. A perfect blend of a researcher as well as a developer. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>While most people know about his intellectual strengths, few, almost none here in IIIT-H know the person he is. Easily, one of the most misinterpreted people in college, he is very innocent and extremely sensitive. It's sad to see people who don't even know him, conclude about his intentions. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Koi na bicky, hum hain na tere saath <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>With all the brain power, he is still a little kid with the kind of energy and enthusiasm you would find in a 10 year old. Few people know that he is quite agile and a fighter in every kind of sport.<br><br>And equally enthusiastic about doing some creative stuff like play writing, singing, playing guitar, etc. He is one person who gives everything his best shot without worrying about what people think about in case he is not good. <br><br>And that is the reason why he has pulled a rabbit out of his hat in every field he has tried. A true winner and all rounder  <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>You'll succeed in every sphere of life champ <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We are there for you always <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Dhokebaaz!!!</b> Akhir nikla na tu hi ultimate dhokhebaaz... mujhe nahi le gaya farewell party pe.. jaanta hai na kis sandarbh (context) mein batiya raha hoon main?? <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Harsh Vardhan Bansal, the personality is as great as the name itself. Harsh bhai batch ke sabhi logon ka khayaal rakha karte shuru ke dinon mein. Quite a mature person, we could always depend upon him to take up responsibilities on our behalf. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>A very sensible and understanding person, it is always good to share thoughts with him. Par bhai, jab discussion debate ban jaye to fir khair nahi.. he will dig you out of your grave to make you listen to his point which more often than not you find quite valid. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Having all the qualities mentioned above, it is only natural that he takes up the biggest of responsibilities and carries them out well. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Quite intelligent and hard working, no wonders he performed well and will always keep doing so in the professional arena. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>A very serious thinker, he is quite philosophical and equally daring to back his thoughts and ideas. The last ingredient that makes him a wonderful human being is <b>sensitivity</b>.<br><br>He is one person who I always felt understood me, and from whom I would not want to hide anything. Someone, who would understand you, take care of you, he was one of those rare people for me in college. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>All in all our Harsh (Fred Flintstone) is a gem of a person and a wonderful, reliable, behasbaaz  friend <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Aur haan ye sun le... <b>Table mein koi feelings nahi hoti. Jab feelings aa jati hain, tab wo table nahi rehti. Sab tere dimaag mein khalal hai</b> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
