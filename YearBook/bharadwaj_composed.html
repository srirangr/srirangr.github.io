<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Looks are deceptive and i can show you to prove it. One of my good friend on and off the field (criketish style), "was" my new ball partner and "is" my captain. Very calm-going, kool and awesome guy to be with. Well i dint know that you dont have a gf, man common act like a man <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>All the very best for your future,<br>Stay in touch and haa.. we SHOULD play cricket in the future.. plan for it... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers<br>Rohit</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I was expecting my first testi from you, thanks man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>So karan,<br><br>Met you for the first time on the cricket ground and I had this feeling of competition with you because it was one of us who will make to the final-11, and I still remember me saying to kiran that I bat well than you (that day I was extremely uncomfortable saying that, coz I knew that you also deserve to be in the team), thank God, things went on well and now we are playing together. <br><br>You always amaze me with your dedication and "tension", both are at extremes. I was expecting you to crack CAT and be an IIM-A grad (hope you will be one and my sincere wishes will be with you). Was co-ord for one of the best ever Felicity and that shows your character, dedication and hard work <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> You are one of my inspirations for starting a blog, thanks for that too <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I know that this testi is in bits and pieces but words are coming dimaag se nahin dil se <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>One small suggestion: Cricket ball can do nothing for you, catch it confidently and don't get afraid of it and haan.. don't ever drop catches in my bowling <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future <br>stay in touch<br><br>cheers,<br>Rohit Bharadwaj<br><br> <br><br><br>  </b></i></ul><br><br>
