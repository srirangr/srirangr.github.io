<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She is good at heart too. She deserves <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> for her dedication to samvedana. keep it up. <br><br>She can also pull your legs. Many don't know about this. She is very good at it. ela dobbutaavu alaga. daaniki kuda oka <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. It is very funny when she is playing with someone. But it is easy to play with her too. I think she is childish and thats one of the reason I stopped playing with her. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (protecting myself in cases when I am silent) She is very sensitive so be careful.<br><br>She loves her family especially her father and uncle. half of the time she talks about them and the other half about their school friends. Her taste for fashion is also good. Thanks for the shirt. awesome selection by you and namrata.<br><br>Most of the time you can see a blush on her face which is cute. She can bombard anything on your face. A straightforward and a frank girl. This is good in many cases. kasidi kuda. She takes a decent care of her academics.<br><br>You are amazing with all the qualities you have now. In one line she is the person who cares, shares, a good comedian <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, family girl, a good friend, fathers daugther, punch dialoguer, kasi and many more. chaala <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> What I can suggest you is to discard your laziness (go for jogging <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), be rough (don't be sensitive), and less straightforward (with your close ones). Thats all. Sorry if I have hut you somewhere.<br><br>Thanks for being a good friend of mine. <br><br>Bye <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first encountered her during my R & D showcase demo in 2nd year. She listened to the whole crap (my project demo) patiently which left a good impression of her on me. From then I used to observe her but never minded much about her.<br><br>The second encounter was during my placement tutorial. She listened to my complete tutorial which should have been painful. This further left a good impression of her. Then I decided to talk to her and know her and be a friend.<br><br>After that, now and then she used to ask some linux doubts which I worked hard to clear <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. In this way I was able to talk her. During IEIR assignment, I started talking to her very freely. After knowing that she is from a village adjacent to my village, I was shocked. How can a village girl from our area enter into IIIT. vurudaaanaa <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. That is really amazing and inspiring. kudos to you <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> At that moment, I decided to be a friend of her. <br><br>Coincindentally, I was present during her crop presentation and asked some doubts (the topic is interesting <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). After that some miracles happend, we were finally very good friends. <br><br>On the first day of our freindship itself, she told me everything about her as if I had known her from many years. This is amazing. I seriously appreciated it <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. She is like an open book who does not hide any secrets. <br><br>OMG for the first time I listened to her joke and forgot to laugh. I was thinking how can she make such a joke. How is her brain designed ?. <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> Its really tuff to understand her joke. Normal way of thinking cannot help you. I felt bad that I missed several jokes of her in the past. She might have come from PJ. Please release the book which pratheek was talking. I will buy the first copy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Very down-to-earth in nature. OMFG!! you seem like one Bigg PJ Queen, Goddess infact, who is capable of making even Sashi slap himself. I bow to thee. I really like the sheepish smile that you give after torturing people around you. May you have the best in life, take care.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The most creative girl of our batch. She is frank and helpful. Your jokes are simply superb <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. If you ever plan to write a book on your jokes, I would love to be the co-author. Remember we had a chat of robbing BoA. Now that we have many new entries, I am thinking of writing the script again. In the mean time you decide on the casting crew. Oceans 7 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> will surely be a big hit. Thanks to Samvedana that I came to know more about her.<br><br>You raack girl!<br><br>Good luck with you future endeavors.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Spandy... is the name I have given her in the very first year and everyone calls her the same <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One would get the impression of a "calm<br>and innocent" girl after seeing her, but believe me she is neither of the two <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Its all sounds the same if I start talking about her comic skills <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> all over again when most of the people already did.. They can describe her better than me as I stand "speechless" for her oneliners.. Ofcourse, sometimes speechless for the sharpness of her brain and sometimes  speechless just thinking.. "Oh God y me???" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Anupama is the only girl who sincerely likes this girl's so called jokes... Hats off Anu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Spandy is very lazy.. One can surely address her as the "Lazy Lattif".. Whatever might be your proposal to her, be it going to a movie or the pani puri or atleast the coffeeshop... The answer is "Abba opika lede".. We are all tired of listening to her excuses <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Also, she is the person listed next to me in the top-10 list of those who sleep for most of the time <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>She is almost into tears even if she doesn't write a class-test well.. "Asalu baga rayalede" is what she says after every exam. She cannot at<br>all, at any cost and by any means control her excitement whatever the situation might be. Never watch a horror movie along with spandy, even if you watched it earlier or not. Suppose you watched it earlier, then she kills you every minute asking for what happens next which highly irritates the latter and suppose you din't watch it earlier, then you need not watch it any further as spandy reveals out the suspense (infact tries to <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) which almost kills your excitement <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future Spandy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Will definitely miss your one-liners. Keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>IIIT ki ragane ee NKP saruku Spandana Gella ninchi Spandy ayipoyindi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>      Spandy...the very utterance of this name gushes back all her jokes to my memory. She's got this Oh-dear-Lord sense of humor. You might think this is an exaggeration but nooooo...you have to be there to believe it. Hear her jokes and kill me if you are not stupefied. I'm always awestruck with the level of complications involved in her jokes <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Sometimes she had to explain how she actually came up with that joke and that joke actually meant <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> There are few classics that have left our minds scarred forever...like the Pushdown Automata, Aditya 369 (this one was actually good <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), chandramukhi, pushpa-this one is the latest (oh yesss...we have actually titled these classics <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). We also had this idea of creating a community of all the PJs dedicating it to her but I don't know why but we never put that into practice (yeah...now, too, is not too late <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) The moment she cracks a joke, you can always see her blushing with a wide grin and Anu next to her clapping and encouraging her <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> But I must confess Spandy, our lives at IIIT wouldn't have been this great and lively without you and your sense of humor <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>      Along with this awing sense of humor, God has also gifted this lass with tons of sweetness. She is an amazing friend. She has a lot of patience and is always very helpful and caring. She is very dedicated and sincere to her friends and acads...Yes, she is a very hard-working gal. <br>    <br>    Hey Spandy...I will always cherish the time we spent. You are a real person for me. Wish you all the good luck in the world and success in all your future plans. Be the way you are...You are just amazing. Will miss you and your jokes. Love you lots spandy <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>She was with me in the</b> english classes. Didn't used to say much, and I never bothered her, thinking maybe she was too conservative and all. We participated in the Rangoli contest in the first year and took the first prize <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Also, she was one of the people who I interviewed in my first year for the article on JV and I was amazed at how candid she was in expressing her opinions. But well, I never did talk to many of my batch girls, till the final semester. Course after course passed by, with Spandana only coming in at the last moment to sit beside Khatri and would give the attendance and walk away. I don't even think we passed as much as a smile to each other. But yeah, we did used to leofy Khatri a lot after her.<br><br>One fine day, in the final semester, the two of us alongwith Dharmeet went to the old age home in Kukatpally. That trip itself changed a lot in me. Besides other things, I also talked to Spandana for the first time, and I was amazed at how completely candid a person she was. Talked about a lot of things. Hat's off to her for going to school 30 km from her home to attend classes. I wouldn't do that for the life of me.<br><br>After that, I somehow felt like I should never join in the leofying of Khatri we do in her name. And I've stuck to it, more or less. Have interacted with you a few times since then, and you always come across as an innocent person without many inhibitions. It's a thing I admire in people. There aren't many like that. <br><br>We somehow always talk as if we're very good friends, or have made a pact to become very good friends. I like that a lot. I hope we work together in BoA and have fun. And any time you want a tree to be climbed or any mangoes to be picked, you have my number <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br><b>Memories:</b> Interviewing you in the first year, picking mangoes.<br><b>Tags:</b> Girls, Samvedana, BoA, 8th sem.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I have had some interaction with this girl when we used to be physics TAs. we used to have fun when we had to correct papers. Shivudu anna always tries to play pranks on her. From what i know she has a childish heart and easily gets frustrated over things. I think she is a bit lazy too .. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>But greats me nicely when ever i meet her. sorry if i am wrong .. all the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I know spandy from my inter 2nd year days. She was my brother's class mate. Never spoke to her before coming to IIIT. Just knew that there's a candidate called Spandana from my brother's batch. Thats it!<br><br>After coming to IIIT, I came to know that Spandy is also in the same house as I am. I thought she will be very active and can be a great help to the house. But I was wrong. She never does anything for the house, except for the singing competition in first year. That was an awesome performance. We sang "Sasivadane" and her voice always standing out of the group. Win/Lose doesn't matter all that matters is fun <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Also I cannot forget about her "Randaka randaka" performance in Felicity '06 for which they won a prize. I know you would hate me having written this line here. But to be very frank, as an audience, I seriously enjoyed the performance. (did full racha racha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br><br>And the next time I spoke to her was in 3rd year, when we were going to Spoorthi. And again, it was fun. I kept pulling her leg for not knowing Hindi <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and she couldn't do anything but give back a smile in reply. It's always fun to tease you spandy. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>And then comes 4th year. IBCT finals. Well, it was she who started the topic of cutie pie and all. I didn't say anything. ANYTHING. And somehow everybody came to know about G1 and G2. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> It was real fun teasing you guys on the ground. But the story took a twist with the entry of G3. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>"Kasi" in studies. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>So there's spandy still cracking all PJs, teasing others and in an illusion that she speaks quite fluent Hindi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>But she's truly a great friend. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I always behave as if I've taken someone for granted. So incase, I've ever hurt you please don't take it to your heart and take it easy.<br><br>All the very best for your future and keep rocking as ever.<br><br>yours<br>Cutie pie <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of my best buddies of my life. We've spent 6yrs studying together. I never know that after my higher secondary I'll study along with her in the same college. When we met for the aieee counselling in NITW, I was so excited that we both got admission from the same University. <br><br>Well, she is a very nice girl and very funny too. One thing I get angry up on her is, whenever we ask her to accompany us, the same old answer is "assalu opika ledhe".. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> she always used to ask us to wake her up in the morning for PT, but when we do, we've got the same answer or "naaku assalu ontlo baaledhe" <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Got fed up with the same answers every time. But she is a very funny girl. <br><br>She is very caring and actually tries to help everyone in need. Talks a lot. And her sense of humor.... hilarious!!! <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>She is one of the few people who are actually very close to me and always used to give her best to help me. <br><br>Hope u'll remember me no matter you make new frends in your life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Luv u loads sweety.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Spandy as she is popularly known <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> is one of my bestest friends. She has supported me through thick and thin and I will always love her for being there for me coz I can be a pain sometimes <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>      She is a very genuine person who thinks twice before doing anything coz she does not want to hurt anyone. Hardworking, dedicated and loyal, I am sure anyone who meets here will realize that she has a wonderful presence and can be a lifelong buddy. <br>  <br>   Enough praising... Spandy could actually give Chuck Norris a complex. Her jokes (or whatever that is <img src=Smileys/3.gif />) keep us in splits and her creativity is mind boggling. I will remember her for her awesome one liners, the trips to the icecream vendor, playing bingo in practically every class and the list is just endless.<br><br>      I am sure we will have many more fun moments in the future coz we will be working at the same place. Spandy you are the best !!!!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
