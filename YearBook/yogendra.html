<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I like Yogi's chubby cheeks and round eyes. I remember the night in 2nd semester when he, I<br>and few others were sitting and talking, all of us 6 or 7 pointers. Yogendra said, "ab se dhyaan se padhna padega yar, waise abhi bhi possible hai apni CGPA improve karna, hain naa, maine seniors se poocha tha aur unhoone kahaa tha ki kar sakte hain." and lo! in 2nd semester he became a 9 pointer!<br>He takes efforts to make best use of life, he studies a lot, plays soccer, and also asked me for suggestions on some good books to read, as in literature.<br>He's a hard worker who gives good importance to academics.<br>For some reason, his face reminds me of "Majid Boo" from Dragonball-Z.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hashmukh bhai is also from the rocking city of Vizag <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I remember that in first two years, whenever we had holidays, we'd discuss as to which train each one of us was catching and when <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . We never got about to booking tickets together, but we did meet up in the train <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is an amazing chap who <i>always</i> has this smile on his face! Hence the name Hashmukh.. He can almost be used as a smilie <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Just like that. He is also quite dedicated to his acads, and does very well in his sphere. <br><br>All the best in life!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vinzamuri.html>Bhanukiran Vinzamuri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yogi another Vizag ka chokra. He is a very nice and decent guy. I remember those days in first year when i, yogi and another guy were ragged by seniors. He was supposed to be aishwarya rai,me vivek oberoi and some other guy salman <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ha ha u were good man <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .Though he is from Nagpur his telugu is pretty good. Ha ha we had some real good times in NBH mess especially when Vikas tried to pull his leg once and he gave one hell of a telugu satire <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Hint ( Baloons vudtava, Arey telidu raa neeku ...) hope you remember this one <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .<br><br>Jokes apart he is very hardworking and disciplined chap. Wish you all the best man hope you go to IISC for your MS.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Yogendra aka Hasmukh</u><br><br>Have always known this guy as Hasmukh, always seen him with a smile on his face, Always cheerful. Its been such a pleasure whenever I have interacted with him. I will always remember that his was the first time where I did BC, used to interact a lot with him in the first year when I was in B section and he used to be sitting behind me. The guy is quite dedicated to his studies which has resulted in very good performance when it comes to academics. The guy would always greet you with a smile whenever you see him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> bringing a smile to your face even if you arent feeling nice. Will always regret that I didn get the chance to talk to him more.<br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future..<br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=arsreddy.html>Raja sekhar reddy A</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>yogi and me same branch, one of the talented guys , very cool guy , <br>All the best ra </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yogi urf Yogata urf Ramu <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... the saving acc. bank in IIIT, wateva money you lend to him, just forget it, it goes to ur saving account, u wont get it back before 3-4 months <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> . Anyways, he is the bookworm of our ecbc group. He taught sampling theorem to all of us. Be careful when u bring some food to your room, yogata will definitely smell it and come to ur room <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . Style mein bilkul hi simple, but soon rock star banne wala hai (thanks to me).<br>You are good whatever you are, be like that, don't change urself. You have a bright future waiting 4 u.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yogendra a.k.a Yogi a.k.a Yogata a.k.a Motu a.k.a Hasmukh<br><br>Undoubtedly he was a Dawg! in his previous life.(This part of the story will be explained later)<br><br>The cool dude of IIIT Hyderabad. Down to earth and simple living - two things which Yogi believes in. His mind is made up of clay - anyone can mould it. For instance in the morning he might be supporting your opinions, but by the time its evening he could be on the other side. I cannot forget the innumerable number of discussions that I had with him. His knowledge about Signal Processing is turly awesome <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  Wake him up any point of the day and give him a problem, he is always there with a solution. Thanks for taking those useful tutorial sessions during placements. A lot has been told about Yogi's activities/goof-ups, but those are some of the best moments captured during my stay at IIIT Hyderabad. I had great fun hanging out with you and I'm surely gonna miss you. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Now coming to the Dawg! part. Like Al Pachino could smell women in the movie "The Scent of Women", similarly Yogi can smell food. His sniffing range can be around 10m radius. Its an impossible task to hide food from Yogi's sight. He has a strong affinity towards Murgi. Plays TT and Football; Drinking Tea; Washing Clothes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />; are some of his favorite hobbies. <br><br>Wishing you loads of luck. Hope you get through IISc Bangalore become bald some day <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part2<br>Tera jaisa dost shayad hi ab milega, I will miss you dude <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .<br>Hope ki jo tune rab se chaha hain woh tujhe mil jaae aur rab teri acchi jodi bana de. Best of luck for your future.<br><br>character he resemble - Shahrukh khan of Rab ne bana di jodi.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yogendra bole to yogata 'the cool dude'. Chutiyapa karna inka janam siddha adhikar hain lekin tht's top secret <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> . Phir bhi inke kisso aur massomiyat ke kuch namoone pesh karna chahunga jo loge ne nahi bataye hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>II year mein GHEB se NBH ke bahut round lagaye hain, kabhi pen lene jaata tha to kabhi hum nahi milte the <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>II year mein ye hamesha bolta tha ki mein **** nahi dekhta hun and then subroto used to click <br>his recent and told him ki tune dekha hain. Yogi hamesha kehta tha ki tujhe kaise pata chalta <br>hain? <img src=Smileys/7.gif />  <br>Inke computer ko param computer naam de diya gaya hai hamare maanniya bengali ji dwara<br>To lijie pesh hain param computer ki kahani ninja ke jubani: Ek samay ki baat hain  ja hum iske room par BC kar rahe the and found ki kahin se system chaloo hone ki awaaz aai but we were wondering ki nonone touched his system from last 15 minutes....(tht's why it is called as param).<br>Haan inke bahano ke baare mein to batana hi bhool gaya itne ghatiya hote hain ki anyone can caught him redhanded. For ex:- Movies dekhne kyun nahi jaa raha- abe naak mein dard ho raha hain etc.. <br>Hamesha paise nahi hain kehte rota rehta hai. Waise inko paise udhar dene mein aadmi 10 baar sochta hain kyunki pata nahi baapis milenge ki nahi.<br> Lekin Dil ka seedha saccha bandha hain. Inke concepts bahut hi jyaada tagde hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> until there is no involvement of mathematics .   He is cool person but looses his temper while discussing some issue. Ab to iksi ikcha hain jaldi se shaadi karne ki islie saare time saajan movie ke gaane sunte rehte hain <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. we used to have lot of discussion about real sensible thing like- ECE in IIIT, Contribution of Engineering to society etc.. Pehle to bahut hi seedha bandha tha lekin inke priya bengali baboo ne inhe bigaad dia. Ab to ladkiyon ke baare mein baat karta hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.  he helped me a lot during times. Ab to Yogata IISC bangalore jaane ka plan bana rahe hain wahin phodega. We have played, sung, worked, enjoyed and done almost everything which can't be described in words.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Iske itne kisse hain ki un par ek kitaab likhi ja sakti hai ya movie banayi ja sakti hai. Aur yeh un kisson mein samay-samay par additions karta rahta hai. Kisi chhoti shop se yeh mobile recharge nahin karvata kyonki ise achchhi shop se mobile recharge karvana hota hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Academics mein bande ne phod rakha hai. Pahle sem mein 7 SGPA laane ke baad isne 2nd sem mein seedhe 9.17 par jump lagayi thi. Uske baad se to banda phodta aa raha hai. Electronics ke subjects mein ise apne-aap hi interest aa jaata hai, lekin agar computer science ke subjects padhne pad jayein to iska mood off ho jaata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Jis subject ko isne achchhe se samajh liya uska yeh bond ho jaata hai hamesha ke liye. Probability isne aur Ninja ne milkar mujhe pass karvayi thi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Koi bhi kaam karna ya na karna iske mood par depend karta hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Agar iska mood na ho to yeh cricket mein run lete huye pitch ke beech mein ruk jaata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Fielding karte huye ball ke peechhe bhagte-bhagte ruk jaata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Lekin TT aur Football khelte huye iska mood kabhi off nahin hota aur dono mast khelta hai.<br><br>Hamesha cool rahta hai aur gussa kam hi karta hai. <br><br>Ab LPU mein isne Senior Lecturer ki position haasil kar li hai aur mujhse Punjabi aur Punjabi ladkiyon ko pataane ke tareeke seekhne ki koshish kar raha hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hasmukh bhai, yogo, yo2, yogi, pata nahi kitne naam hai iske !! <br><br>but sab naam se bubbly types feeling hi aati hai !! <br>Always there with a smile until iska mood kharab ho jaye !! inki hasi bahut achi lagti hai !!  <br>Chicken ko bahut prem karte hai !! <br><br>Sports main inhe bada interest hai !! <br>Inki harkato ki dastan to logon ne yahan pe bayan kar hi di hai !! <br>But he is a very innocent and down to earth guy !! <br>Iski conceptual understanding of the subjects he like is wonderful!! GATE podhne ke saath saath hi inhone Lovely institute main professor ki position bhi pa li hai <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> !! <br><br>Good luck for your future buddy !! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sagrawal.html>Shashank Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yo se yogo...Lovely yogo...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Yogo is very sweet. He looks at the good side of people. Simple banda hai - enjoy karta hai. Its easy to make him laugh, and he laughs so heartily that it makes everyone around happy. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I would never forget one incident - actually accident. It left marks on both of us. Culprit was obviously me. We were returning from a lunch buffet and I had a class at IIIT, so was driving very fast and carelessly. Yogo cautioned me a hundred times against doing so but I didn't listen to him. Unfortunately, when we slipped I had nothing to say. We were bleeding all over. I thought Yogo will scold me like hell. But inspite of the excruciating pain, he kept his cool. Didn't say even a single word to me, not even an angry look. On the contrary, when he found that I was feeling guilty, he said, "Abe ho jata hai". Hats off to you man <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> At least in this life, I would never forget this accident.<br><br>Apan dono thode research type bande hain isliye mast baatein kartein hain. Kaye cheezon mein view point bhi match karta hai. Jab main kise ki buraaye karta hoon toh yogo khoob hasta hai. I really enjoy talking to him. Concepts bande ke katlimate hain. Classic samajhata hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Yogo has lappy aur uska gussa, dono hi bahut khatarnaak hain. Dono se bach ke rehna chahiye <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Best wishes and lot of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yogi ... he is a real 'masterpiece'.<br>I think I will take the responsibility to document the numerous accounts of this great personality - so that they are not lost in the pages of history.<br><br>1. He wanted to edit a picture in notepad.<br>2. Once he knocked someone's door for about 20 mins ... because he wanted to wake him up. Later someone told him that the door was locked. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>3. He started creating ppt in notepad. But later someone saved his day by giving the idea of trying it in MS powerpoint.<br>4. He went to a shop for recharge coupon. Then later he asked shopkeeper - "Fresh hai na?"<br><br>.......... ab mujhe kuch aur bhi likhna hai.<br><br>Yeh hain hamare sweet yogi ji. This person is one heck of a person - as sweet and simple as anyone can get. <br>He is a bond in things he likes. He doesn't care about the things he doesn't want to know about. Has his own little, cute ways of doing things. I can never ever imagine yogi using any harsh word. He is very very innocent. Jokes ultimate crack karta hai.<br><br>Hats off to you!<br><br>Remain the same - we need good, humble, innocent people on earth - to define what 'all good and no bad' is.<br>All the best and may you conquer peaks in all the paths you take in life!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yogi, the coolest one. Iski harkate to ultimate hoti hai. Yahan likhoonga to pata nahin kitne testi's likhne padenge.
