<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is one fo the chocolate boys of IIIT. I wonder how jrs missed him in that category. We have done NLP project. I managed to get a reasonable grade only because of him. He gave instinctive answers in the presentation. We played cricket in OBH and when he hits six he gives a peculiar childish, innocent smile like that of SRT.  He has great communications skills and knowledge. Because of that he cleared interview in the first attempt.<br>                   My best wishes for your better future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br> Sanket a perfect organiser, a perfect leader and a very good friend of me. The first impression that came to my mind is he could be a good politician when elections for CR candidate were conducted and he told a manifesto while campaigning. While others are just confident of their so so blind supporters. Any subject he takes, he presents himself in a very impressive and convincing manner. I personally observed this boy doesn't have regional feelings at all and thought that he has some qualities that resemble me and we came together to work for batch trip. Here our friendship got stronger. But felt sorry many a time for Sanket for many reasons. I'll say the reason at the end of the batch trip. <br>         I felt bad when you didn't concentrated on MBA. You are the perfect person for that and I really wish you a success in your future. <br>           If you want to form a political party I'll be the first member <img src=Smileys/4.gif />   </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I had very less interaction with her but I feel she is very wonderful person. I think she and Navatha (vayuites) rules the allrounders list.  She gives her best in Academics, sports and organisational activities but never shows ego at any level. It wonders everyone and she is the perfect inspiration for the Juniors.<br>           <br>              She is the best caption for Vayuites and I tried a lot to join vayu but failed because of frustrating IIIT rules.<br><br>All da best for your future. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Very good friend of mine. He is the one who always wishes me with a smile. Cool attitude. Prashasti is correct in her testimonial. I also personally feel First impression is the best but one shouldn't stick to it. I never forget the day when you said that " May be today is your day get ready for it" at the time of placement sessions. It helped me a lot.<br>         He is the typical IIIT guy plz never go to his room. All da best for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Navs<br>Still I remember our first meeting when me and Charan greeted on your birthday in the lab. She is the one most trust worthy person in college. She is one of the best frns in our college. But every one to their surprise and ofcourse me also we never talked to each other for one and half year for no reason. I'll never forget the day when you again talked to me.<br>        <br>           Apart from our relationship, Personally I vote her as a best alrounder in IIIT. She gives her full heart at what ever she does. She and Prashasti tried a lot to convert me from Agni to Vayu as I was discouraged by lack of opportunities. she is very attentive at her looks. Literally I survived from DLD exam only because of her. She has great skills in explaining. I personally give her an advise to do Ph.d and become a professor. not in LPU <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .<br>She does things in extreme levels. telugu lo " athi vrushti anaa vrushti la"<br><br>Ne ways Best of luck for your future. Miss you <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>"V for veer" suits him very much.<br>Straight forward person. He is a very sports person and plays cricket very well, even analyses the situation very much. Thoda aggresive hai lekin is cricket me yeh bilkul jaroori hai. He is the person who recognised my cricket talent and spirit right from the first year. But he finally convinced the team in the final year showing IPL stats to include me in the batch team. He encouraged me and in the process of match he used to remind me of my strengths and boosted me.<br><br>All da best for your research.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nammu.. She is the one whom I first talked among girls in our batch. I still remember that conversation. She is very straight forward, friendly, caring, sensitive. She is an absolute puzzle for a stranger to understand her. She is a box of varieties. Many to their surprise we never have downs in our friendship. We built our friendship very strongly understanding each other and respecting each others' opinions and values. Many of our batch mates know me as just a box of PJs. But she is one of the best friends who knows real me. I some times gives small advices to her. But I never thought she takes them seriously. I came to know when she took my advice for taking the very important decision of her life. It is very difficult for me to hide anything with her. We became more close at the time of BTP and during Viva, she used to give me confidence when I get tensed and I used to when she was. I just want to say everyone that trust one person completely and never expect anything from the other side, it will definitely leads to a great relationship. <br>		Apart from our relationship, she has a very good sense of humor and great managerial skills that one should inspire from her. She is a well matured person and knows what to do at any situation. Sometimes I got surprised that how can such a lazy person works hard at times of need. She is the person who introduced me to Apprentice seasons and I enjoyed those episodes very much. I was a big fan of her on the dance floor. She is a very bad singer. Still we managed a group song and it was lot of fun for the listeners. I watch movies very often but coming to Eng movies, I watch selective list of movies given by her and I think she is the best critic of Eng movies.  <br>		She is one of the friends who lend me great support in dark days of my placement and filled me with loads of confidence. But to our destiny we got separated as I got placed in LPU. I really miss u a lot<img src=Smileys/6.gif /> I wish, I hope and I promise that Sammu-Nammu friendship never gets strained. My best wishes for your futur</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is one of the matured guys I have seen in IIIT. He is one of the good frns of mine. He has gr8 command on his senses. He smokes for some period of time and when he want to leave it he will do it. same with the case of drinking. One should take him as a inspiration for having command on his will power and senses. He is a practical man and responsible in his acts. Other than these qualities he has gr8 chemistry with Charan, Abhilash etc., pics do speak abt him. He is a good reader of any person.<br>Apart from personal qualities he is a very good cricketer and encouraged me a lot in my bowling aspects. He has a gr8 potential in batting and reads the situation very well. Though he was not the better captions like Sachin but he has gr8 sporting spirit like him.<br>My best wishes for the completion of MS.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Goki ante linux. Linux ante Goki. I don't remember how many times I re-installed my PC because I have enough support from this guy every time. I personally lot of times iritated him with linux issues but he clmly solved my problems. He is an ultimate lover of telugu, traditions and culture. He is still trying to protect these things in his own way. He is an ardent follower of telugu novels.<br>  He gets angry very quickly when comes to arguments. This is the only thing I suggest him to decrease his anger. Many milestones ahead of him. I wish him best of luck.<br>  </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the most studious girls I have seen. I first met her as an Agnian. She has got some different style of worse humour in the early days of IIIT. But now she changed a lot. It became even worserhttp://172.17.8.64/yearbook/Smileys/24.gif <br><br>Very sensitive. She was very friendly and sometimes I feel she is very smooth, beautiful and delicate glass to handle. I still remember the days when I gave tips for running in sports meet and she got prize as well. She was well known in IIIT for accidents.<br> One should get inspired for her work nature, helping nature, cultural activities and leaving many more for the people to explore.<br>My hearty wishes for the future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dgkreddy.html>D Girish Kumar Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He is unique, special, different, determined, psychic. Everyone still surprises how I managed with him as a roommate for 2 years. He is subtle in his words and none understands him for the first time. If we try to understand the inner meaning then we can know the actual Girish. He is well attached to everyone and gives a typical stand for friendship. I didn't encounter such a personality in my life and may not in the future.<br> I always argue with him regarding Sachin Tendulkar. But all to the surprise we both are gr8 fans of him.<br>My best wishes for his future. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=charan.html>Charan Thota</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Charan aka cherry aka Pilla P****. Vadi gurinchi nenu chepte veedikanni positives vunnayaa anipistundi meeku. One of the best frns of mine. One canot understand him if you are not close to him. His acts differ by time and situation. I think he can become a great leader iff he overcomes his laziness. He is IIIT manmadhan. He every time tries to counter me, but every time he uses the same technique. I wish he will try differently. I thought of doing doing spoof for Billa with name Pilla. Here Cherry gadi ootha padam "aalta veesta" chinese lo deeni ardam " arey nidra vastundi ra lepakandi" . He gives great value to friendship and does anything for it. I'll never miss him at any point of time. <br>I wish he will achieve greater heights in the future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bhargav the style icon of IIIT. If I were not placed I thought of opening a showroom "Bhargav's  collection". He is a very good designer, hard working and always tries to break my counters. He is a silent killer. His creativity and work nature is very good. I wish both of them go well in the future.  </b></i></ul><br><br>
