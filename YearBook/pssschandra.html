<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>PSSS - THe first image I pictured when I heard this name was of a dark, lean, not-good looking and a typical south pappu kinda guy. Well aaabviously I stand corrected. He is totally different from what I expected him to be. Fair, veryyy handsome, got a great smile...gotta confess he was looking just awesome on the Farewell day <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Of course...the rap written for him stands totally true <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I never really had a chance to actually talk to this chap but from what I know of him he is an extremely cool guy and yes...his English - toooo good man <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I really wish we talked more <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br>All the best for your future dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I met him first time when I was in desperate need for help to pass physics I course. Apart from his prowess in physics, his interest in comic books and science fiction was another reason for our discussions on different ideas of possible stories.<br>I really liked his story, SNAP. Hope he writes similar stories or better ones in future.<br>The first time I met this guy, I was reminded of Luke Skywalker as he was wearing similar kind of a shirt with hood.<br>He and Srirang were the coolest roommates I've met. Their room oozes coolness. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And after moving in OBH to 2nd floor wing with Sashidhar, Maruti and Bhargava in the neighborhood, their wing would surely be the coolest one.<br>I remember the various wacky things they did this semester and Sharat's pics.<br>on the rocks kept in facebook. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Frankly speaking I was surprised that he was a native of hyderabad! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Maybe one day we could create a sci-fi graphic novel.<br>What I would like to take from him is his prowess in logic and his wonderful imagination in the domain of science fiction.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Well the previous testi is how Sharat would be if he would have born in the mfking detriot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Cut the crap, lets write something sensible now <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Sharat is THE CHOCOLATE BOY of IIIT. Pata nahin kitne bandiyon ka crush hai. He is also one of the most humble guys I have met in whole life. Genious is a small word to describe this guy, iski Maths esp. Geometry is totally phodu <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Though he is an EC guy, he was the part of the programming team which went to amritapuri in second year. This guy is damn creative, have never met a creative guy like him !! <br><br>We had a small stint "Alien Homies" his comics were totally ROFLMAO-maaal . Colgate pepsodent banke kya kya likha mama. He was one of my fav. bloggers ( though he blogs rarely <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) . I loved the story he wrote for his English literature course. Summary:- Jo kuch bi likhta hai totally awesome likhta hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .<br><br>Bhai sahaab, the way he laughs is totally ROFLMAO. He always gives his fav. Colgate smile when people are taking pics <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He also makes people laugh with his awesome PJs and Jokes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>He is a big foodie, he can eat anything which looks remotely edible. <br><br>The best thing I like about this guy is that he knows what his dreams are and also knows how he can achieve it. And I am damn sure he will achieve them pretty soon <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>Kuch bi rehnde, ye hyderabadi chindiya bolta. Baigan yaaroon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>All the very best for what your startup, and ya mera job pakka hai na ? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Keep in touch ( thoda door se plz <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  ) <br><br>Peace </b></i></ul><br><br>

His room is full of P.I.M.P.S and Hoes ... Sashidhar is his chela , bt he didnot allow any hoe to go near him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He has been smoking pot since the age of 6. His life is all about drugs, sex and rock and roll .. wait rap too <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br>He is starting a new company, bas naam ke liye .. its actually a undercover for his new international mawali gang. <br><br>Best of luck for your future and sorry for spilling the beans to everyone <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..<br><br>PS: Stop smoking man !

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>By far the most sophisticated and genuine guy I have ever met, PSS is someone who has so many things to be learnt from. He is very soft spoken. His socialising skills are too good and this is why he is among those very few guyz who are at very good terms with most of the batch.<br><br>He worked day and night for the Literary Dept. of Felicity and made it a grand success. Hats of you you <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Now he is working very hard for Samvedana and taking it to new heights. He made a software and planned for a startup. He's currently working on the backend and I hope he'll get something great in that front <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Good luck for your startup.

<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>PSSS aka PSS aka Sharat</u><br><br>Almost 2 years ago, I wrote an Orkut testi to him, mentioning that he is the guy who defines the word <b>dude</b> and two years later, I still stand by what I said then. He is just way too cool. An awesome person to have as a friend. One thing which is always assured is that you can never be bored in his company, always fun to hang around with. An extremely sharp and creative fellow, you just have to listen to his ideas to appreciate the genius that he is. One bond that I share with him is the Astronomy Olympiad, we both have been to the camp which is organised in Mumbai. Actually this was one of the starting point of our friendship, I very well remember the time n first year when we all had made our sites as a part of ITWS-1 course, didnt know the guy quite well at the time, just a casual hi-hello type. The guy comes up to me and starts talking about Astronomy Olympiad telling me that he had also been to the camp, that was the first time that I had a feeling of kinship with the guy and since then its always been upstream. Have always been a fan of his out of the box thinking. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Its always fun to talk to him, displayed by the fact that he is one of the very few guys who I have had long conversation even though we talk in English(which I dont like at all <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, the eng part not the conversations <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) and the dumbass that he is, even though he knows Hindi, he prefers English and although it may sound like show-offing if somebody else does it but with him its just normal. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Bow to thee <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Here's wishing you all the luck for your future and hoping that you rock the world with your entrepreneuring ideas.<br><br><b>Most Memorable Moment : The sutt we shared on the rock night this felicity</b><br><br>Cheers to the DUDE of IIIT..

<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Pee Sharat Chandra a.k.a  PSS  a.k.a  P(i)SS  a.k.a  Konda  a.k.a  Neuron  a.k.a  P Triple S. <br><br>It was the first working day in our college and it started with general conversation - AIEEE rank, School, IIT. And when it came to Sharam Coaching - Sharat "Stop I say! Arey mama Srinu ra <img src=Smileys/77.gif />" (a typical sharat expression). And then the discussion continued day after day; Any random topic any class we didnt really bother what the Prof was teaching. Sollu was our prime objective. Joined by our very own local celebrity Prof Prudhvi Vatala (Om Sai Ram!) we had gala time in the first year. He has got great analytical thinking power. He help a lot in my physics course which was way over my head. Prof Mukku used to just keep on writing text/symbols on the board which wasnt a familiar lingo. Only Sharat used to nod his head. Twam mahan ho <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>Then came first year Quiz Club. It had phodu members like Satvik, Samaba, Aseem, Arun amongst the seniors and Sharat was the only one who opened his mouth when it came to Juniors <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Best moment in 2nd year was during course feedback time. Sharat was so pissed off at LA course that he decided to write a one page write up about the professor's way of teaching and the course, got few printouts, distributed them to the junta and asked them to staple it along with the feedback.<br><br>A total food freak and enjoys to the fullest whatever he eats. You can call his tummy a Garbage Can. Apart from that he enjoys Programming, Wiking, Doing Weird Stuff, Quizzing. Day Dreamer and ever smiling face - that's Sharat for me. Standard "eeeeee" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Happy Dent White moment) expression when it comes to giving a pose for a photograph.<br><br>Ask me to pick one person who has got out of box thinking ability - Sharat would be first one in my mind (Followed by Scientist). A lot has been said about his work during Felicity 08 <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Good luck with your plans. You raack mama! Stay away from "the chick" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Will miss you at times when there is excess food in my room <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nvkartheek.html>MNV Kartheek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He is a very cool guy ....has got a lot of creativity .. resembles "eminem" ... all the best for u buddy ... waiting for u r "Muse"...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>baboi veedaa!! I have never across a creature like this ..he has a got a  memory like an elephant ... I couldn't understand most of the things he speaks about He is truly a geek <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ....you should have seen  the way he answers the questions in contests ... I feel gr8 to have such a friend<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>To give a description of his personality  his face is the ideal smiley <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> always smiling, remains totally cool...I haven't seen him getting frustrated anytime always lost in his alien world and responding 2 mins late to the  real world and that's the reason we entitled him with nickname kondaa!!<br><br>He does lots of things ...you should of seen his to-do list. He has a passion for hatke type of words/phrases and whenever he finds them they become word of the week, he uses those words all long the week no matter wat the situation is ..some of his fav words which i remember are Racha!!, cliche, pandga cheskoo, vachi naku <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>although the words seem simple but when he says in his style u know wat it is like ....<br>    <br><br>recently we have started solving crossword together and every time I end up with you r a geek type of expression on my face<img src=Smileys/77.gif />!! he has lots of patience in him, he answers all my questions patiently. I am sure I don't miss him after IIIT since we all r planning to have the same flat<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>there is this funny experience with him which goes like this .... he came to my room to solve crossword..hey buddy just a moment i gonna use bathroom..k sure...returns and started solving ...after 5mins heads back to bathroom again ...on return  i asked him watz up ???... he replied me "sry i was quite unsuccessful in my first attempt"<br><br>finally all the best for ur muse  and keep rocking !!! btw  your new cellphone promotion campaign "Nokia 36-24-36" rocks!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[contd...]<br><br>We started talking during Felicity'08's video making..Before that, (atleast I was) completely unaware of his existence. We were in the video team and also in tech team. Thankful to Felicity that I am, it has given me some of my closest chums. Then we started hanging out for start up saturdays and I fail to recollect when we became this close.. All the awesome night outs our 'gangsta' has <i>marofied </i>, my birthday night when we all were sitting at the banyan tree, fighting over constellations,or the recent one - you, me, prateek chicha and bhargova in front of GH - eating biscuits, oranges and talking arbit crap, commenting every couple which crossed our way <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Also, the emosiional chat we had - usurping MSIT's balcony.. Great times, aren't they? <br><br>	Oh, and by the way, he sketches quite well <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> [Thats right, you know what I am talking about - the elephant one :X <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ] Not a big mouth really, but when he is with his closest chums, he goes berserk doing <i>racha racha </i>..  I so much wish we ought to have met earlier and not at the end of our stay in -H <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ..<br><br>	Every single person dreams, dreams of doing what he/she actually likes doing. It is only very very few people who actually take those dreams seriously and push them to a next level and believe me, it takes a lot and lot of perseverance and will power to not give up, to not go where the crowd takes them, to not be just another face in the crowd.. You find that perseverance in Sharat, he never compromises at what he likes or what he wants.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>	I really wish he joins CIQ..We can do total <i>racha</i> there man..Think about all the fun.. Kidding...Muse it is!!! Wishing you loads of good luck <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> Recipe:</b>  3 table spoons of Chandler's sarcasm, 4 table spoons of Joey's cuteness a million table spoons of Ross's sweetness.. Blend all the above ingredients and well.. <b>DO NOT FORGET</b> to sprinkle Phoebe's crazyness all over the dish and bingo!! You have got a "Sharat" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>	Yes, I am quite aware of the countless number of hearts I have broken for being close friends with the one guy on whom "every girl" in our college has a liking <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> This is gonna be a shower of all the ahhsomeness you possess buddy.. He is adorable, cute, he is innocent yet amazingly and unimaginably creative.. Brilliant with literary stuff, something because of which I think we started binding initially and we just keep talking and never stop until somebody around us gets annoyed and asks us to shut up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	A real nice guy, he has got quite a lot of names conferred upon him - sharbat, neuron-pokes,hippo etc.  A complete foodie, teendi potu to be honest, veg, non-veg , mutton chicken, you name it.. If it is teendi, then it has to reach sharbat's mouth. We have a lot of things in common we both loooove chocos, F.R.I.E.N.D.S and fight for Chandler <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. We have overlapping likings - be it music, TV shows , people <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> - he is a victim of all the stoopid homo jokes I crack..But of course, he is God like when it comes to current affairs and all the tech stuff, he always has got something very interesting in his mind to share with me. A good listener and great at sarcasm that I am, we have a total blast every time we talk <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> So very talented and yet so not-assertive about it, man.. you are awe-inspiring <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	Everything he does is so <i>hatke</i>.. Be it the birthday "gift" he gave me or the ahhsome complicated hexagonal thing that I got from him quite recently.. Thanks to my eye injury incident, he now on wheels, bent on finding an eye patch for me to give me a complete pirate look <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Right from the first year when he, along with somani and abhilash, used to crack all those coding contests, i used to wish i had some of this skills and qualities. He's an amazing coder and the most creative person i've met. He's insanely aaahsome and has this very unique style when it comes to writing. His creativity with words is simply superb. Thanks to felicity, many people know he's unique in many more ways. <br><br>Sometimes his actions make him look like the geekiest person in the batch! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I think he lives in his own fantasy world sometimes! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We always catch him daydreaming or should i say, thinking about something totally different from what we all would be discussing! And it's because of this, Vinay ( the most notorious member of our gang! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) leofies him! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He's smart and intelligent but in certain things he's still a kid! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And yeah! how can i forget about food!<br>He's such a foodie, he doesnt care what he's eating sometimes. If it "looks" like food then it has to go into his stomach! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>We had our share of dull moments but i believe it's because of these ups and downs that we've gotten to know each other better and our friendship has grown stronger.<br><br>We had so many ideas for many creative projects (blogs, comics, short films, spoofs and many more), it was mostly because of my laziness and the lack of proper time management on my side and my involvement in many things at a time that most of those got confined to the white board. But i'm glad we'll be working together for atleast for a year more and i'm sure we'll make atleast a couple of them a reality <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>aah! so much more to write...will write them down after i've written testimonials for the rest of the Gangsta Gang! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Dont really remember when and how we started interacting, i guess it was during<br>one of those bc sessions that sharat, prateek and prudhvi keep having, in the class<br>sitting behind me in B section. OMG! these three used to do so much raccha, gani<br>and i ( we were like the 'accha bacchas' back then, "trying" to listen to the<br>lectures <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ) used to laugh our asses off! Then the English classes!!! It was<br>'heaven' for all of us in B2! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We were like the luckiest bastards! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> If anyone<br>saw our English class, it would seem like a scene straight out of Happy Days<br>movie! <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>There are so many aaahsome memories like these right from the first semester, so<br>many interesting conversations, hours of bc - most of the time they were on<br>the lines of "How different it could've been if we werent in ECE!" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I remember,<br>both of us were in this huge dillema, whether to shift to CSE or not and for<br>some stupid reason we decided not to (and we kick ourselves even now, for not<br>taking advice from the right people). But we've realized everything happens for<br>a reason and probably we wouldnt have had the chance to work together on all those<br>interesting project and ideas if we werent in ECE!<br><br>It was because of those projects and the time we spent in trying to make all <br>the new ideas/plans, which we keep having every other day, a reality that we<br>got to know each other better. there was a time when we used to get new ideas<br>for the "next big thing" like every day! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And i used to spend hours making<br>"5-year plans" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> right from the design of the logo for that application/product<br>to dreaming about the millions of bucks it would make! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>It didnt take much time for me to realize we're similar in many ways ( he's<br>little more g33kish than me though <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) and we were in similar situations and had<br>similar plans for our future. He doesnt want to be just another guy in the crowd<br>and he doesnt have to try to be unique. He does things "jaara hatke" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I so very agree with Aniket when he says that Sharat is the definition of coolness - in more ways than one. I have never seen him agitated. Most of what you say is going to be met with a sweet smile <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And yeah, he nods his head to whatever you say. I remember all the lit meetings during Felicity '08, it was amazing to see him maintain his demeanour always. He was pretty good at all the stuff he did for the fest. The lit part was almost entirely revived by the efforts of Kharkwal, Narang and him. <br><br>The thing with Sharat is that hes always bubbling with ideas, in whatever sphere it be. His ice cool demeanour allows him to analyze and situation and come up with creative solutions. A few days back, I was amazed listening to his idea about extending the domain of 108 to local colleges. Similarly, his ideas for Felicity were brilliant! I think hes a guy who can be a brilliant entrepreneur or consultant <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>His exploits in the literary domain are well known. I love his writings, they're pretty cheesy and whacky. And yeah, hes not far behind when it comes to fooling around and having a good time. Refer 3rd day, stage events, Felicity '09 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Character/person he resemles: Dexter, Rajdeep Sardesai<br>Fav memory: Lit meetings for Felicity '08<br>Message for him: Do think of a career as a consultant <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Part 1</i><br><br><b>Sharat, another among the people </b>I came to know well only in my final year. All in good time, I'd say, as I probably wouldn't have been able to appreciate them had it been any earlier. Sharat is one of the coolest guy around. In fact, in many ways, he defines what I call cool. <br><br>In my first year, I saw him when he had moustaches and I thought he was a chutiya. <br><br>In the third year, he was the main Organiser of Literary events at Felicity and was the organiser who would shake his head in agreement at every suggestion of yours, making you feel as if you were the smartest and the brightest guy around, and would later never ever let you know what all events he was organizing, let alone ask for suggestions. That was as well, now as well as then, for he redefined the Lit events, and that's what we had aimed for. Kudos <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>I came to know him properly </b>only in the final year, and a few things will always stand out. The way I gaped at his CV for the first time when I came to realise that every SINGLE project was an outcome more of his imagination than of anything else. Then of course there was the paper he and Abhilash had written on their own. And the absolute chilled out, no-tension manner in which he handled the placement season, and got placed. And the previously taken decision of not taking the job, but going for a startup on his own. The amount of freshness this guy has interms of ideas, and his absolute confidence in his grey matter and his hard work, that he is not afraid to take those ideas forward is just amazing. And what sets him a class apart is the clarity, the transparency, and the genuine, good natured smile that's always there. There's no Ayn Randish self centered arrogance or apathy for the world, despite the absolute individualistic approach to life, but a goodwill and flexibility towards everyone on the personal front. The laugh is not only still child-like, it's also plentiful.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maheshraja.html>Mahesh Raja</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>lol @ Vam's post<br>Sherry as i call him is a uber cool dude, Always smiling and hanging out with friends. He is intelligent and tries to innovate .. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We used to discuss a lot of things as we are nocturnal. Its really easy to make him laugh .. he laughs even to ur faintest of jokes (alpa santoshi) <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>All the best ra sherry for ur future projects <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Sharat, there were innumerable things we did together. We are programming team partners, remember the first year days during which you solved numerous geometry problems. We also did some projects together. The music similarity function, the blog similarity function on which  we wrote a paper and also got it accepted. The adventurous 4 meb bike ride that we went for on a mid night. The discussions we had on a wide range of topics (acads, life, girls, etc)..The list goes on and on..I will never forget these.<br><br>I must say, you are an *Imagineer*. You imagine things that if existed would surely make a difference to the way people peceive this world. For example, the msf, what the food, brands etc. Stick to these ideas and you will surely succeed my friend. <br><br>You are a good quizzer, programming contest organizer, problem setter. You also write scintillating magazine articles. A good basketball player too.<br><br>the curse of ECE didn't leave Sharat too. The day you got a 'D' in LA, you wanted to convert to CSE. I remember the phone call from your parents raa. But none of these stopped this guy from imagining. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>I didn't speak about the *choclate* boy. The guy who flatters girls on the fly <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I will not speak much on this. <br><br><br>All the best for your future.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
