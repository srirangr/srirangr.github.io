<b><a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Abey bade aadmi, aisi badi baatein nahi kiya karte <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. We can definitely be the best of friends. In fact, for me a friend is someone who can be trusted. And for that matter, I always trusted you so, for me, you've always been a good friend. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>That we have different priorities and have slightly different takes on life is an altogether different issue, but I really don't think what we aim in the long run for ourselves and for the others is drastically different in any way.<br><br>I never tried to handle any ragging cases, just wanted to be friends with the freshers, but guess it all bombed big time <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Well, Karan is a <b> very hard working, extremely dedicated, and even more extremely emotional and sensitive person </b>. Kyon be, theek bola na? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And then of course, the leader and manager that he is, ab tak to gaon gaon mein bachcha bachcha ye baat jaanta hai.. no use rambling about his organizing and managing capabilites. Excellent ra!!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>What appeals to me most about this person is his <b> innocence, simplicity, and very sincere, dedicated and super-emotional self </b>, that reminds me of myself of a few years ago <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> [Only the super-emotional part <img src=Smileys/5.gif />]<br><br>Brilliant at academics <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> [pata nahi kitne log to isey padhte dekh ke complex ke maare hi underperform kar gaye honge], and cricket, abey tu bowler to hai hi badhiya <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, batsman bhi bahut achcha ho sakta hai.. self-belief chahiye bas.. ye meri paarkhi nazar aur nirma super dono ka waada!!! <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Baki yar wo felicity mein tumhari help nahi kar paya kyunki bahut zaada pareshan tha apne issues mein, believe me aur koi baat nahi thi.<br><br>To fir bugge, all the best for future!!! Make sure, you are yourself no matter what the situation is and you will always be a winner. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> And may you attain your ultimate goal <b>to live with continuous happiness and prosperity</b> soon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Itne sare testimonial! They are the certificate of his popularity in the batch. We have never talked much albeit general talks in the mess. I will remember him for his persistent and responsible attitude towards whatever he considers important. I can not forget the day during felicity when I came to you regarding the issue of prize money for Mystre' event and you listening to me carefully without a whit of smirk on your face that I was expecting due to all the commotion that was already happened. When I went back I had the faith in you that you will look into the matter. And indeed in the end all went right <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>I wish you all the best for your life. Do not forget us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Karan aka madoo ante speedster. <br>Whether it may be speaking or writing english or solving logicals <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. You co-ordinated the felicity-08 perfectly <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Jhagde to hote rehte hai kyunki jindagi isi ka naam hai. Batch cricket team mei bhi hai bole to all rounder <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.  <br><br>Hope u achieve what all you set out for yourself.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Hey!<br>Thanks for the testimonial ya..That's truly sweet <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Sad that I dont know him much but can certainly tell that he is a very nice person. Harshita's courtesy. Awesome blogger and impeccable english. The way you speak the language is quite adorable!<br>A guy who is excels both in acads and cricket.<br>Shabash boy! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Finally, sorry if you felt bad for that telugu incident ya! I have started watching my words since then <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I got to know more about him only during Felicity. Rest of the time it was only commenting at blogs and greeting whenever we met accidentally. It was he who had inspired me to blog and I sincerely thank you for doing that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.Undoubtedly of the strongest pillars of Felicity 08 and yes we did set standards which cannot be broken so easily. Remember the night before Felicity - You, Me, Chand, Harsha, Pagare we were all on the stage that was being set, trying to predict all the possible outcomes of Felicity 08. Though Felicity 08 didnt have any major sponsor, Maroo had brilliantly planned the entire Felicity 08 with the limited budget was available. And the outcome was maximum celebrations, highest level of bonding, bringing out abilities of the batchmates and various other things that brought a +ve wave throughout the batch. I wouldnt have recognized my managerial skills (which I still need to work on) had it not been you who had trusted in me and given me responsibilities. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. One person whom I would love to consult for an opinion be it in any field - acads, career etc. Lots has been told about his acads, his abilities. For me you are a superhuman (after Felicity, before Felicity you were <img src=Smileys/26.gif />).<br><br>Good luck and wishing you loads of success. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Karan Maaro...aka Maadu, the inspiration of lot of people. He's smart, dashing, optimist, hard-working, intelligent, extremely cool, BCbaaz and is very close to each of us.<br><br>He was one of our Felicity Coordinator, and it was due to him we had the best felicity ever in our campus. The way he managed entire fest was amazing. We had a lot of setbacks during felicity, but he didn't give up. Hats-off to your dedication Karan <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Studies mein bhi bande ka koi saani nahi...bahut phodu hai. I still remember during Jawahar Sir's assignment he was the one of not many to finish them very early. Final year mein thoda casual ho gaya studies ko lekar, but still manages to get nice grades <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Maintaining a nice CGPA.<br><br>I also admire him a lot for his in-depth knowledge and uncomparable General Knowledge <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Whatever is the topic, he has a lot of arguments regarding it. A very good orator too. He has won various prizes in debates <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> This paid him during his IIM-I interview, jo isne phod diya. Reading his interview, everyone was sure that he'll be selected....and truly so. U can refer<br>http://karanatiiit.wordpress.com/2009/02/<br><br>During placement, I still remember the amount of preparation he had done was really appreciable. I pray to God, ki Maroo ka jaldi se ho jaaye kisi company mein, because everyday he clears the written test...and many of us feel iska hoga uske baad hi hamara kuchh hoga <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He also gave me a lot of moral support during those tough times <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>He is also an integral part of our cricket team, the strike bowler. Although came in picture late, but once he got a chance to play, proved himself. Mixes his pace really well and is always on target <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Whenever we need a wicket, he is the one to get the breakthrough. We had nice memories of winning the Inter House and Inter Batch Tournaments. The Eat-Street outing with him is one I'll cherish lifetime <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Forgot to mention, he is a big fan of Sachin. We also watched a lot of matches together<br><br>All the best Maroo for your future<br>For You <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the smartest guys of our batch and someone who is not afraid to speak his mind - Karan is one of those guys who I wish I had interacted more with but I was quite a jerk early on in my btech <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is extremely organized and has always been good with managing his acads and extra-curricular activities. I remember the time in second year when there was this controversy he got embroiled in and he handled himself with a lot of dignity and calm which is commendable <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br>Was the co-ordinator of Felicity 08 and am being totally unbiased when I say that it was the most well planned and executed Felicity that I have attended in the 4 years of my stay here and it was a lot of fun as well <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Congrats on getting into IIM-I and on securing a good job. You deserved 'em both. I know you will be extremely successful at whatever you chose to do in your future because you have all the qualities that define success. Loads of good wishes and keep rocking. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u>Maroo aka Madooo aka Raju Time Table aka CAT Guruji</u><br><br>So finally I sat down to write the testi for this guy jiska nam hai Maroo...<br><br>Starting from the beginning, we werent too close friends in first sem or so. Rewinding back , I seem to remember that it was almost always in pagare's room or first floor that I met him. The event of me going to his room or he coming to mine was very rare, infact I cant seem to remember anytime when he came to my room <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Although I remember the outing we had in the first sem, which was almost courtesy Maroo, he was the only guy who knew about Hyderabad and thats why he acted as a guide to us. To date that outing remains one of the most memorable outing we have ever had. Thanks a lot Maroo for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Along with Adi he was the person who was completely against the concept of the formation of a group <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, a view point which tahnkfully was over ridden by the majority and we got TB as a result, which has been one of the best thing which most people in the group consider as the best thing to happen to them in these 4 years. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The formation of the group led to a lot many outings, one special feature of many of these outings used to be that, we used to roam around on roads in search of Autos and kept singing songs like Road-side mawalis, which used to be a source of frustration for him, Maroo always the excited guy wanted to sing along with us, but since we used to sing Old songs, he would never know the lyrics and get frustrated <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>Although we were friends but it was only in the second sem when he shifted to cellar as a roomie of Pk, who was my previous roomie that we starte to bond well. After all pehle vo 3 floor upar rehta tha.. main thehra aalsi, itni upar kahan jata and vice versa for him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of the most significant event in the 2nd year was when he sorted out the differences between me and Pappu, I still remember he used to go on long walks with us (and tab tak he used to be a pakka time table, itne baje padhna, itne baje khana, itne baje sona), he sacrificed his time table for our sake. Finally thanks to his effort there was peace between Me n Pappu, can't  thank you enough for helping me regain a friend whom I almost lost.<br><br>3rd year for Maroo meant just Felicity, all his time, energy n  thoughts were dedicated to Felicity and almost everything he did was related to Felicity, which resulted in him growing apart from people without him even realising it coz he was too busy with Felicity. I remember many of us had the same problem with him. Even I didnt interact with him much except talking about Felicity but I dunno why, but I never got the feeling of being detached even at that time. Even in those times, he always remained as close a friend as he was before this Felicity tamasha.<br><br>Ofcourse when I talk about Felicity how can I forget to talk about his dedication towards Felicity, He lost (and regained ) many a friends coz of it, he screwed his grades, he screwed his time table. He basically screwed up with the principles on which he had based his life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> The quoute of <b>Early to bed and early to rise</b> was given a toss and the whole semester was filled with night outs, one after the other.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>And then came the final year, which is definitely the Golden Period of our friendship, this is when he came to our wing. Since then it has been nothing but a joy ride <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Had a lot of fun with this guy. So many things we have done together in the wing be it <b>Mathur ki Chop, Manish ko chu**iya bachha bol ke uski marna</b>. One of the ROFLest thing he started was, when he had to fill his water bottle at times he would drag the whole wing to the water cooler to fill their bottles, during one such trips, mathur's room was opened forcefully and he was dragged away while he was watching STUFF <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and ready to do something <img src=Smileys/3.gif />  Will never forget the look on his face at that momemnt <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Talking about CAT prep, he was always sincere about CAT and since I too was going to give CAT, he bloody used to keep poking me to work for the bloody exam. I had left giving Mock CATs but it was only due to his effort that I started giving them again. All the effort I have put in the prep of CAT, which involved analysing my mock CAT papers and doing some DI papers was courtesy him. I have never seen any guy so concerned about someone else's preparation as he was for me. To this date I mantain that his contribution in me getting the IIM call is equal to my contribution in it. I will never forget the 2 and half hour rebuking session conducted by him (assisted by Chand), and that too when he was averse to wasting time as it would hamper his preparation. Man, I have never founf anybody so concerned about his friend as you were for my CAT prep, thanks a lot for everything you did back then, will never forget and will never be able to repay you back. You were just too awesome man.. THANKS A LOT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I always wish that you are with me the next time I give my CAT coz next time it would be more difficult for me to prepare as I would be working the next time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>Next came the placement season, me and him had to go through the pain of clearing so many written tests and returning back disappointed after failing yet another interview. We would be sitting there, waiting for the interview, give our best, do well in the interview and then come back dejected and rejected together, curse the company and then go next day and clear yet another written exam and the porcess going on. By the time we got placed (in the same company) I was the guy with highest interviews and he was the runner up <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I still remember the day I had my NVidia interview and I was returning back dejected, tired almost finished, not able to speak. I and Adi went to Suraj, and there came Maroo's phone, he told me <i>"Chinta mat kar, dulhan ani to hai hi, bas date pakki hone ki baat hai (or something like that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) </i>. He also had the Nvidia interview and he too faced the failure and yet he called me up to console me. Love you man for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> One of  the most memorable phone call in my life.<br><br>I wont write too much about how excited he gets, or how dedicated he is, or blah blah.. Or how people at times are afraid of him, even I am afraid of him whe n I do <b>You Know What <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b> but at other times he is the nice shishya of mine....<br><br>Ofcourse how can I forget our Guru-Shishya ka rishta, he always calls me his guru, and both of us the <b>"Guru-shishya"</b> jodi leofy people together, be it Manish in the wing, where we forcefully christened him <b>Janice</b>, or the <b>Chu**ya bachha, HPS</b> nicks I gave him which we popularised <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and told almost everybody. Another enjoyable thing would be the <b>Leofying of Maglu </b>which is our fav time pass in the mess, we keep leofying him about his love for Australian team.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>[Part 5]</b><br><br>My most painful memory would be when you told me that you were finally going to Indore, <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I just couldnt hold myself together, it was as if someone had taken my lifeline away from me. For others it didnt come as that big a shock but with you it was that you might stay here in Hyd which was the main reason for it hurting more. I just couldnt see you for a long time after that and came to my room just after that as I wanted some time in solitude to digest this fact. Luv u loads man <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> I always wish you hadnt given me this moment <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best.... Hope to see you as a succesful CEO some day who is fodufying the business he is in <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br><b>Fav Memory : That phone call I guess <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Song for you : Tere Jaisa Yaar Kahan, kahan aisa yaraana<br>An Advice: Dont join I, you deserve nothing below "A", you are the BEST</b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>    This might have come off as a suprise, but here you go.<br><br>	Karan is one of the guys I have always looked upto for what he does and for what he is. The way he manages his work, his relationships and all the extra curriculars - be it cricket, be it organizing any event, is just amazing. We would really like to hear from you  few of those <i>How-to-efficiently-manage-your-time</i> lectures. Everything he does, he does it with perfection. Its exams season and you can always spot Karan either in library or in the reading room. Its <i>masti</i> time, and you find Karan being the first to pull others legs. Its time to take up responsibility and you have him as one of the major head. Its inspiring Karan, the passion you have for what you do and the way you do what you do. From placements to Felicity, he has always given his best shot for everything <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I have never really known him at the personal front but I do know that he is the gossip girl of -H, if you ever want to share some news to the whole campus but don't know how, you need to pass that info to one of these three people - harshi, karan or chand, and your wish is granted.<br><br>	Wishing you truck loads of good luck and hope you always achieve what you dream for, because you deserve every  bit of it! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>	</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>He likes to argue with me sometimes on a level in which I generally speak, during meal time in mess. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>For some unexplainable reason, he reminded me of Akshay Khanna when I interacted with him for first time.<br>I still remember our visit to a company for sponsorship (don't remember the name). He told the representative of that company that I was responsible for the technical decisions and she asked me a few things, sadly I couldn't reply<br>but Karan jumped in and handled the situation. Phew!<br>I made a deal with him that we'd go out for drinks party but I declined later because I fear I might puke. He was quite excited about it though! But I still went to Club 8 and had 5 mugs of beer... he was quite surprised, so was I...<br>chadi hi nahi. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>He is quite an achiever, he's a 9 pointer, a pro at cricket, was the coordinator for felicity and recently got into an IIM, isn't it enough to tell<br>about the awesomeness of this person.<br>Add to it, he's quite a down to earth and helpful and actively takes part or organizes events. It was also great to have taken the Eng. Lit. course in 3rd sem with him.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

Then I came to know him as karan. <br><br>Then I don't know how we became known to each other. Became close during felicity. I was really amazed by his dedication to felicity.

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part I<br><br>Madoooooooooooooooo<br><br>Maroo & Me(sounds like Marley & Me)<br>This testimonial is for one of my closest friends in IIT and for a person I truly admire and respect. My first impression of him was of some kickass stud, but baad mein baat karke pata chala bhaiya to kuch alag hi hain. He came from Sri Satya Sai school had not interacted with girls for<br>like two years <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We both got along from the day one. Back in the first year, we used to have BC sessions with him and Mridul arguing over stupid issues like how many runs were scored on the 43rd over of some random match. He was all phadaku types in the first year. He used to come to our wing in the first year to ask doubts and we would ask him to do sit ups before asking a doubt<br>and he would naively agree. He had the highest collection of porn in the first year which sounds pretty logical considering the fact that<br>he was in some Boys schools and had not seen girls for almost like two years. I still remember our antics on his roommate , Karan ki Kiran and irritating him by just saying one line "Maroo tu gay hai?". He was damn organized from the first day but interestingly this never relflected in the state of his room. He would plan out his day and used to sleep sharp at twelve.But that was Maroo in first year. Many people have testified on how dedicated he is  towards his work and I am<br>just going to substantiate that.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part II<br><br>Maroo for me is an epitome of dedication and sincerety. I still remember  My orkut testimonial to him in the first year. I had written how much I have learned from him. And even after four years the equation remains the same. He has surprised us with his dedication, I still remember when he was back after writing CAT, he underperformed and was not expecting many calls.<br>He was dejected, but the next thing he asked me was "What should I study for placements?"<br>He woke up at 6 am the next day and started with placement preparation. Maroo, has defined priorities , he knows what he wants to do and works for it. At times he has missed on some good moments because of his commitments. But, he has<br>always made up for it. He worked his arse off for our seniors Felicity'07. No doubt, that he was the Felicity Coordinator of Felicity'08. Maroo is straightforward. He will tell you right on your face about what he feels about you. Tough, he changed a lot during his coordinatorship journey. Bande mein thoda ego hai and at times he behaves like a kid. He would say "main usse baat nahin karunga kyun ki woh mujhse baat nahin kar raha hai<img src=Smileys/10.gif />" But bhai ke liye , he never got his ego in the middle. Whenever we had an argument one of us<br>would take the initiative and phir se BC chalu.He has immense respect across all the batches. I still remember how the whole batch supported him when he was caught in the "ragging case".<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part III<br><br>Coming to the lighter side, Maroo is more or less blind. Has uncanny resemblance with Akshay Khanna.<br>Has a weird laughter. Interestingly, he changes his style of laughter with people.Has all the qualities of a Marwari. For him, 120 bucks Chocolate Avalanche is cheaper than 15 bucks Dosa. He is the only person who is as good as me in Hindi. Loves debating. He can debate on any arbit and senseless topic. Likes to carry his angry young man look, best part is when you disturb him when he is working on something and the "oh! I will kill you" look is damn hilarious. Its quite easy to leofy him. He knows this and recently after following the footsteps of his guruji he has managed to leofy others as well.<br>For the record, he is an awesome orator, decent cricketer, phodu in acads and a pathetic dancer, pathetic in biking. I will miss all those BC sessions we had ranging from Girls, politics, College, who is better SRK or Aamir! He would come to our room and ask us to accompany him to fill water bottles. How can I forget, small fights we used to have over mobile charger. How much he gets irritated over our late night BC. Every morning he would come to me and<br>say "I couldn't sleep properly because I could hear you laughing all the time". Me, Manish and Bhalu always chose the part in front of his room for our Late Night BC. Maroo bhai se sabh darte hain, we are all chickens in front of him because you never know when he is going to blast at you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part IV<br><br>Felicity '08, perhaps the most important chapter for both of us. We had a point to prove to our seniors, who never really believed we could make a fest bigger then theirs. I still remember how irritated we used to get whenever they mocked at our batch. It was an awesome ride, We had<br>our moments working for the fest. He is damn organized, which really helped our Fest. Every step was well planned and executed. Aah, his attachment with the fest was so much that he really stopped socialising. I have worked for three batches Felicity and for me you have been the best coordniator. I know how important and precious it is when you have someone at the helm of the fest who believes that all his peers are the coordinators and not him. Me and him, we both have organized many events together, right from<br>freshers to Felicity. We have had endless BC on "Campus sudharo" topics. On the third day of the fest, he drank for the first time and got damn emotional. Man, he cried for the whole night and kept praising each and everyone in the batch.<br>Four years with him, we have had many cherisable moments. We have been through our share of ups and downs. It was sweet of him when he came to me and said "for you I will never have my ego in between" and I can only say that neither will I.<br>Some Memories, First years leofying, organizing Freshers, getting you drunk on the last day of the fest, every bit of Felicity'08, your dhissum dhissum, TB ki ladayi(the meeting you organized near the old felicity stage), your love for LP and how much we hated it, your tantrums for me not taking you home, our recent club 8 trips and for all your support. Maroo, you have been an awesome friend. I know you will achieve success in whatever you do. All the best bhai aage ke liye...<br>Phod dena!<br><br><br>Cheers!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

You were sincere, passionate, open, and like a leader carried everyone with you <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Although he lived in cellar for a year, I hardly knew him that well, apart from his characteristics like time-table <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, fodupanti, a good speaker, his passion for cricket and his worries about getting a good CG. I think this few of his characteristics has made him winner in every phase of college life. He is now popular, is friends to many and a totally dependable guy for all the batchmates. He has really made his success path. Kudos to you dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The felicity after night party was the first time we opened ourselves (whatever may be the reason <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) Since then its not just "hi" here and there , we talk often, during BC sessions, Dinner, lunch and whenever I meet him, we can always have something to talk and laugh about <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .

But I'm telling you, if you remain here we'll have loads of fun for sure. But take the right decision after considering all of the things. Don't make a haste in this decision. I know you will definitely make a big entrepreneur some day. Hope you reach the heights of success. I know I can contact you whenever in some need or trouble. I assure you that you can always count on me. Be the same as you are because you are one of the best leaders and organizers of all those I have ever seen.

<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 4<br>Mujhe roz subah breakfast ke liye uthane ki zimmadari ab buddhe par aur ispar aa gayi. So, these guys used to wake me up for the breakfast and we used to go together. This responsibility is still with buddha and him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I go late for lunch and dinner, so I don't find anyone to go to mess with me. But here also, Maaddoo hai na. He also goes late for his meals. But he has to wait a lot in mess coz of me as I take a lot of time to eat but he never says anything. But haan, kabhi-2 jab bhalu bhi saath hota hai, tab ye bhi shuru ho jata hai uske saath dukhi karne. Yahan aakar ye kamina Bhalu ka shishya ban gaya. Ab ye dono milkar mujhe khoob irritate karte hain. Pehle har ek se marvane vale bande ne ab maarni shuru kar di. I was amazed to see his dedication for CAT. But we(Chand, Bhalu and me) disturbed him a lot (Sorry for that buddy). We daily used to have our BC sessions from midnight 12 to morning 4. And when we would wake up, we could very easily see frustration on Vipul's and his face. Once they got so much irritated (remember that dumble incident when we were trying to wake Sambhav up from Chand's room) that they decided to leave the wing. Badi mushkil se bhailog ko manaya humne. Some of the memories include "Mathur ki chop karna (even if he is not around.... ek baar to bechara Bangalore ya Chennai mein tha, tab bhi uski chop karke use SMS kiya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), light gayi - light gayi thing, going together to fill water bottles (aur jo bhi na aaye, use jam kar irritate karna), Manis-Janice(u have already mentioned in my testi but it needs to be there in yours too <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), going together for our meals - be it breakfast, lunch or dinner and of course, endless BC we did on various topics and many times, without any topic as well... just completely random.<br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 3<br>He is also popularly known as "gossip boy" of our batch. College ki koi bhi news chahiye ho, Maadooo hai na <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . We played TT a few times and he was like, sprinting from one end of the table to the other in excitement thereby hurting himself a few times by falling down. But his attitude was, do anything to win. And it's not just TT, its for everything, be it CAT or organizing events like Felicity or anything for that matter. Cricket should definitely be mentioned in his testimonial. It has been a treat to seeing him from not being in playing 11 of the batch team in first year to being in playing 11 of IIIT cricket team now. His dedication to whatever he does is amazing. In second, third years as well, we remained very good friends but a million thanks to budhau for bringing him in our wing - THE wing as he says <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br>As far as I remember, I first met this guy in NBH-146 having some argument with Mridul. What an argument that was !! Legendary I must say <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Later I found out that he was in the same English group (A1) as mine. We used to have all the classes and labs together. We also used to have our meals together and we became good friends quite soon. I found him very sincere, studious, hyper at times and very much dedicated in whatever he used to do. He knew C-programming before coming here and helped me whenever I asked for. A kid at heart .... pata nahi chalega kab kis baat par gussa ho jaye <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He used to come to Adi's room during exams for asking a few doubts and we used to say " do 10 sit-ups, only then we'll tell u the solution". Poor guy even agreed to do once. At that time, we were definitely good friends but not that close. But I thank God that our friendship grew stronger with time as I found a real good, caring and helping friend in him who will do anything to help you out and get you out of the trouble. At that time, his image was somthing like this - "jab bhi kisi ka kat raha ho, isse dekha nahi jata aur ye apni marvane ke liye beech mein interrupt zaroor karta hai" which remained the same till 3rd year but he changed in 4th year after joining THE wing about which I'll be talking a bit later. So, going back to the first year, he was the guy along with Chand who encouraged me a lot to take part in Hindi elocution competition and I think I must thank him for showing so much confidence in me and encouraging me that time. He was "early to bed and early to rise" kinda guy and tried to remain the same until he could. But his dedication for Felicity made him to leave that practice and I think our whole batch would be thankful to him for organizing the best Felicity IIIT has ever seen. Seriously, he is a perfect blend of amazing organizational skills, hard work, dedication, intelligence and management. I think he'll make a good manager.<br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>

You can talk with him on almost everything under the sun - sports, politics, economics, history, etc. <br><br>He has always been supremely confident. Be it studies, oration or sports. He likes to stick to his arguments. Sometimes, arguments with him get heated up as well. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Only a few gather the courage to enter in a word-fight with him. I can take the honor of being one of those.<br><br>He has always been a career-oriented person. He has set goals and is someone for which career gets a priority over other aspects of life. Right from his starting days at IIIT, he had his guns aimed at getting an MBA from IIM. His kind of genuine belief in pursuing management is to be found in very few. Five years from now, don't get surprised if you see him in a swanky BMW talking the investment banking fundes. He has high aspirations in his life and with the kind of commitment and dedication he approaches things, he is definitely going to make it big.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>PART 1b</b><br><br>One could see him work overtime in the build-up to Felicity 08. Day in, day out, he worked meticulously and left no stones unturned. A lot of credit for making Felicity 08 the grandeur it was goes to him. He had a special connect with Felicity. Right from the first year, he played a very pro-active role in the organization of Felicity. It is tough to find a person with such prowess in event organization. <br><br>I have never seen anyone at so such amazing time management skills. One will hardly find his wasting his time. During his entire course of 4 years, he has always been up to something big - Studies (1st year), Sunday Carnivals, Other Campus Events (2nd year), Felicity (entire 3rd year), CAT preps followed by Placement Prep and then IIM GD/PI prep in the 4th year. Adding to that, he was one of those sincere chaps back in the 1st year. He would start solving the C assignment the day they were handed out while I could never start before Saturday. Although he cares so much about assignments, he is still sincere in spirit. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>PART 2</b><br><br>He likes to take a serious view on anything whatsoever. Where would one find a person who gives his 100% in a friendly match as if it were the tournament final? Anything he takes up, he does it with all his heart and soul behind it. You gotta watch him play TT or foosball!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>As a friend, he constantly motivates and provides astounding moral support. He always had a couple of cheering and motivating words to say whenever I was down. I remember an incident when I was not performing well in 2nd sem exams due to some other commitments; he sent me a series of 3 motivating SMSs. (I lost that phone<img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) It may sound childish now; back then it really mattered. <br><br>In other incident, I was very disappointed with my 3rd sem result at the beginning of the fourth sem. To that cause, I remember him giving me a nice pep talk in front of library where motivated me to go for nothing except a 10 pt. His words were a constant source of encouragement for me throughout the 4th sem and I came really close to it at 9.6.<br><br>One of his important personality traits is speaking his heart out. He holds no bar and speaks whatever he feels like. He can say a NO with pretty ease. That's commendable. Though it's good to talk straight, often it does not go down well with one's company. I personally feel that it's better to be a bit polished at speaking so that no one gets hurt.<br><br>The guy has a clear conscience. He had always been guided by his set of strong principles he had acquired from his school days.  I strongly believed that he was one of those who never touch booze. However, he proved me wrong (much to my delight<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) and his Felicity connect proved to be a reason strong enough to draw him to booze on the third night of Felicity 08. The booze-regulars comprising of Pagare, HImank, Chand and me always were on a lookout for any addition to our group. And we welcomed Karan whole-heartedly since he was the last person to join.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>PART 3</b><br><br><i>The good times</i><br><br>We were the best of buddies for the most part of our first two years at college.  I never imagined that I will have such a close friend ever.  We used to share all that was happening in our lives - girls, grades, gadgets, etc. <br><br>We met on the 2nd day at IIIT. Starting from our first interaction in my room, I sensed that this guy is one of these smartasses - smartly dressed, fluent English, Reebok shoes, etc. We became good friends in no time. I really admired his helpful nature. He helped me a lot when I became ill during my first week at IIIT. <br><br>We both had a passion for knowledge and understanding various issues. We discussed, analyzed and debated on a plethora of topics. This was in spite of having different personalities - While Karan was one of those extrovert and limelight-hogging kinds, I preferred to stay more to myself. At times, we used to bet 5-Stars. I still owe him one. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I also credit my improved English speaking skills to the English-only chats we had in the first year. <br><br>We moved around the city a lot. Chirag, Karan and I went to Pizza Hut, Skyline hall and MPM numerous times in our first sem. Those rather inexpensive outings travelling in buses now seem more satisfying than going to the Little  Italys and Tandoors. It was generally the two of us who decided our outings. We used to spent hours on fullhyd.com finding a place to go. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Those were the days, really.<br><br>We participated in a lot of quizzes and other lit events as a team. I will always cherish the events in the 2nd year which were highly rewarding - 2nd in Quiz and 3rd in DumbC. <br><br>Also, we were the only two people who were against the idea of TB formation. Luckily we our word did not prevail and TB has been one of the pillars of our IIIT life.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>PART 4<br><br>In a now hilarious yet memorable incident, Chirag and Pagare played a prank on him in the first sem by sending a proxy email from his account. Karan was enraged beyond the normal and swore to become a master of hacking in 10 days <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> and take revenge back on the Chirag and Pagare who did their best at apologizing. However, no amount of apologizing would have satisfied him. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Poor boy. Has a long record of his accounts getting hacked. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br><br>The not-so-good times:<br><br>However, things began to change in the late 4th sem when a couple of ill-fated arguments took their toll on our friendship. Comes the 3rd year, he got busy in Felicity and I got busy in my own things. For the coming months till Felicity end, we rarely talked and whenever we did, it was something related to Felicity. I had my part to play as well. He had to miss the Goa trip due to my last-minute plan changes. I could not really get a time to apologize since we anyways did not interact much then.  <br><br><br>Back-in-Black:<br><br>Things become more normal in the 4th year. Last time we went boozing, we went down the memory lane and tried to revisit some of our first year days. And we affirmed each other that we wont ever let those memories fade. <br><br>Message for you:<br><br>Think twice before speaking<br>Become the Citibank CEO someday <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Finally in 3rd year becomes the felicity coordinator. <br><br>His dedication and efforts in felicity was worth appreciating.

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>I'll always remember </b>Karan as a guy who is very balanced and hard-working.<br><br>He's one of those guys you won't find skewed towards any one particular side. He's good at all the many things he does. Be it studies, cricket, general awareness, making and maintaning friends and contacts alike, managing things, thinking, writing, speaking... He can speak on any given topic and is quick witted and always comes up with his points very nicely. I think that's not an aberration, but comes from the overall clarity of thought he has, which is a difficult thing to achieve and comes from leading an overall good, balanced, sufficiently disciplined life. Kudos to you for managing yourself so well, bro <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Someone who does so many things so well, of course needs to have a lot of energy. Karan is a very energetic fellow, full of life and commitment towards whatever he does. The way he hugs everyone after taking wickets and the way he managed things so beautifully in all the Felicities... that was just too good. <br><br><b>We have had our differences,</b> but if two people are anything, they will have their differences. He likes to work balancing monetary gains and profit motive with ideals. It's a guess (would like to fancy it's an educated one) that that's how the typical highly successful MBA people are supposed to be. I think that you're gonna be a rich and super busy man very soon, bro <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He has touched a number of lives in IIIT, through the impossibly vast amount of activity he has done.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 4</b><br>Loads of memory associated with this chap in the last four years, some of which are - outings in 1st sem, endless BC sessions in NBH-47,BTP meetings, Middleware mein kaatna, Felicity '08, daaro  sabha after Felicity'08, rides and meals after AIMCATs,  phatta session @ coffee shop in 5th sem, placements, laughter session with GAG <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, club 8 outings, his famous head laugh which looks something like <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  and many more.<br><br>All in all Maroo has been one of my very good friends at IIIT.<br>All the best for your future and may God bless you !<br><br><b>Fav.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 3</b><br>The control that he exercies over many things is really remarkable. Never does anything in excess, be it eating, sleeping or some other because he has this fear that this will harm him in some way or the other. But this is where he misses the fun <br>part and I would advice him to stop being so particular about things and just let things go. Does get aggressive a lot, especially during GD or debating and can scare the living hell out of people. He is also adamant at times and it's really impossible to persuade him to do something which he is not willing to.<br><br>Felicity'08, now that is one thing in which I saw him at his best. Being the coordinator he played a pivotal role in making it one of the best Felicity in IIIT till date. He managed each and every aspect of it with such discipline, dedication, enthusiasm and ease that it was worth being a part of it and for that I would just say <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  The time just when we hugged each other and he broke down at the end of Felicity was the most emotional moment associated with him. <br><br>Always there to lend a helping hand to his friends and help them in any situation he can. He is the best example of - A friend in need is a friend indeed. Who else can better understand this than me  especially after the incident on last Holi. He and Piyush were the two people who actually saved my life on that day, stayed awake all night long in the hospital and helped in every best possible way they could have to help me recover. Thanx a lot Maroo for everything <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 2</b><br>Talking about his dedication, what can be a better example than his preparation for CAT. It was his passion and worked for it with all his heart. He deserved a lot lot more than what he actually got and I really hope that if he gives it a try again he will surely make it into IIM-A. But still getting through IIM-I is really a commendable feat <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Even durings placements, he deserved to get placed a lot earlier but somehow the luck was not on his side. <br>Speed is one of those qualities which separates him from the rest. Given the speed and enthusiasm with which he performs every task,  be it reading, writing, typing, speaking, eating  makes me believe that he has got some extra energy genes in him. Always full of energy and excitement, he has been a source of inspiration for many around him.<br><br>He also has this immense love for cricket and is simply crazy about it. Made a lot of effort and finally succeeded in being a part of IIIT's bowling attack, though he still has to work a lot on his batting. He also had umpteen BC sessions and debates on cricket in TV room, OBH wing, almost anywhere and everywhere. The Gossip Boy of our batch, always has some or the other happenings in the campus to gossip about and enjoys narrating them with a lot of spice and exaggeration. Hanging out with him is lot of fun as it's easy  to leofy him <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> and he never feels bad about it and just reponds with his cute smile <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br><br>He is one of those guys who has changed very little since first year. Still has the same enthusiasm and dedication towards any work that he does, be it attending classes, preparing for exams or any other. A total time-table guy I must say. One thing that he really needs to control is his anger <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He does get angry a lot and sometimes for some weird reasons and when he does it's really difficult to face him. Some people are not able to talk to him much mainly fearing his anger and I must say, sometimes I am one of them. So bhai Maroo, thoda gussa kum kara kar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Part 1 </b><br>To write a testimonial for Maroo is really a tough task because there are so many dimensions to cover of this multi-faceted person that it's impossible to put everything into words, but still I will try.<br><br>Madoo or Mr. Perfect as I would like to call him is one of THE ideal person that I have ever some across <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and it feels really great to have found a great friend in him . The all rounder of of our batch who does each and every task with utmost dedication, sincerity and perfection. His time management skills are simply superb and knows exactly how much effort is required in each task to come out with flying colours. Be it CAT, Felicity, acads, cricket, blogging, BC, friendship or any other, he has proved his mettle in all <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.<br><br>Our friendship  kicked off right from the first year. At first look he appeared a total nerd to me <img src=Smileys/26.gif />. Still remember him wearing those thick glasses as he always does and noting down names of our batchmates right before the English test on the first day as part of some ragging assignment. Pappu and me had a good laugh on his sincerity towards such an unimportant task <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. But from then on our casual greetings turned into friendship in a very short span and had some awesome time together. Some memorable moments of first year are the grand outing in October, giving him bumps in workspace, TB formation, cricket debates in Adi's room, countless BCs in NBH-47 and many more. His knowledge of slangs was really poor at that time and even faced some embarassing moments because of that in workspace which was fun to watch <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. He had this time table thing right from first year(Raju time-table) and used to get annoyed if anyone interfered with that. But still I had my slice of fun leofying him on that and sometimes he too enjoyed that. <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Karan Maroo was the second guy I met when I first came to IIIT-H. Within minutes of meeting each other, we started talking about Harry Potter(the 6th instalment was out the day before) and how the story would turn out. Just the other day, when we were chatting, he added in a few more details like how he managed to convince me that Hermione dies in the end, a proof of the fact that he is pretty good at convincing people. Maybe someday he can become some kind of a lobbyist. But all that was like in ancient undocumented history. The part that I'll never forget is the Nov-07 to Feb-08, during the run-up to Felicity and Felicity itself. At times, I had seen him take some real hard decisions and it was/is inspiring to see that those decisions paid off in the end. The session after Felicity was great as well, with a few emotional moments which only strengthened our friendship.<br><br>During these four years, he has met with a lot of success (for which he worked with so much of dedication and discipline) and I hope it continues for a long, long, long time to come. He has the attitude and the aptitude to make it to a high altitude. Ten years down the line, I'm sure he'll be this big shot business guy.

<b><a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I don't really remember talking to Karan in the first year.. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> it was during the 3rd sem and especially coz of the course 'Language Programming in Literature' that I got to know him better <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. the course brought us to the common ground of discussions... there were loads of them.. the chief topic used to be the 'fairer sex' <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..<br>It was around the same time when I started blogging.. and I was kinda inspired by him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ..<br>He then moved to cellar (NBH) and there we had some really exhaustive BC sessions.. in particular I remember an incident.. where we ended up chatting with each other for 4-5 hours .. even though we were sitting in adjacent rooms <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br>Oye... I just recalled one statement made by you... it was just in the beginning of the 3rd semester.. we were all in the BB court.. and you said sth like " agar is saal bandi nahi mili to main g** ban jaoonga" <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... I hope that hasn't come true <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Then came the Felicity 08. It feels so good to look back at those times of numerous meetings, preparations, discussions, arguments, fights <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... <br>We all used to say " maroo ki beti ki shaadi hai" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br>But his leadership, management <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> saw us all through a gala successful event <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .. though there were moments when I wud see maroo loosing his nerve but it happens with one and all <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Then came the phase of CAT ... this was one hell of a time to remember forever .. what with all the aimcats on every sunday.. discussions... over marks... percentiles.. ranks... question papers... taking tests at room, in library... <br>I still believe DI is maroo's strongest section... as it was verbal for me.. but I screwed in verbal.. and he kinda screwed in DI <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. but still he made it through IIM-I .. which is a truly commendable feat <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ... <br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My first interaction with Karan happened when I was abt to give my english test for deciding the grps... he came to me and asked my name and home town (bec. some seniors has asked him to do so.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> )... I was surprised by his confidence and way to talking and the best thing he is still the same... Later I found out that he is seated besides me... very attentive in class he used to ask a lot of doubts but also tried to take part in bc between Kapil n me....  He also in my discussion grp and there also was one of the most active member of the grp...  It helped me a lot as he used to talk a lot and me and some other guys were not bothered by the professor to talk.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... His enthusiasm in doing everything ( studies, games [cricket], organisation[felicity] ) is well known among the batch... and he has succeeded in allof these....  I have seen him playing cricket and volleyball and sometimes I worry that he will get injured because of the effort he put in the match <img src=Smileys/1.gif />....  Even during the CAT prep... he was the one abt whom everyone was sure that he will make it to A and he also did very well but due to unluck cudn't clear one topic.... but still he is selected for Indore <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ...  <br>Best of luck for ur future... and one advice for u...

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Karan, Mr. Coordinator, is a perfect friend one can have. He has so many qualities and one can learn many things from him. Disciplined, hardworking to its core. Those who have seen him prepairing for CAT must admit that he is the most dedicated and hard working guy one can find. If he likes something, he just go about it and dont leave any stone unturned to achieve it (though sometimes he fails but this does not demoralize him <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Raju time table, as some people call him, laughs in a very wierd way. From almost zero talks to best buddies, it has been an amazing journey.<br><br><b>1st Year</b><br><br>We never talked in first year. I knew him because of Himank and some others because Himank was like a common friend between us. When I joined TB, I came to know that people tease him a lot for his roommate. I remember only once going to his room on 2nd floor and that too to borrow some book. I used to go out with Himank or PK when he was also there but never talked to him actually. When everyone was going home in the summer vacations, someone was going home and we all went to see him off. Maroo started crying that how will we stay away for 3 months. I was simply amazed that how can someone behave like this. But now I realise that emotion completely and hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to him for being such a good person at heart and a really good friend.<br><br><b>2nd Year</b><br><br>Then in the second year, he shifted to Cellar and thats when we actually started talking. We both had same sleeping times. We both woke up in the morning for breakfast and used to chat about something. It was then that I came to know much about him and realised some of his fine qualities. He was good at studies, always managed to finish his asisgnments on his own <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, spend time with friends. In all, he managed his time perfectly by devoting sometime for everything. I always relied on him for clearing doubts and providing textbooks.<br><br>Contd...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Due to some ragging issues, he had DISCO on him. Everyone in the batch knew he was not guilty. Except that some really harsh decisions were passed by the DISCO committee against him. It was then that the whole batch stood by him and fought for him. The batch unity was visible for the first time then. I still remember the day, when he came back from his hearing and had a letter in his hand. He just sat there on his bed crying. I wanted to console him but there were so many of his close friends there that I thought its better to leave him there with them becuase we were not very close then. I felt really bad that day. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br><b>3rd Year</b><br><br>When we shifted to OBH, he stayed alone in a wing. He made some very "good"friends in that wing <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. His room was such a mess that one had to find space to keep a foot inside. I always wondered how did he manage to reach his bed and cupboard. He even missed our Goa trip. I realised his leadership qualities during the 3rd year when he conducted our Felicity so efficiently. He was the unanimous choice of the batch for the coordinator. That Felicity was the best, IIIT has ever seen. As it is said in Hindi, kutton ki tarah kaam kiya usne. I never thought that he will booze. But that myth was broken on Felicity third nite. He drank then and was out soon. He cried n cried (though I missed all the drama because of manish and mota <img src=Smileys/14.gif />). One day after that, we again had a boozing session and he again cried that nite <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Unknowingly he hurt me that nite but it doesn't matter now because we have come across so many things after that, that such small things doesn't count in our friendship. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is also dedicated very much towards Cricket. He is a very good bowler and holds the record for never getting out in entire college life, his top score being 2 notout. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I used to make fun of him earlier for this but this never stopped him in praticing more n more and become such a good bowler. Hats off to him for his spirit. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Contd....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>4th Year</b><br><br>I always respected him for his qualities and never thought we could be such good buddies. He is among those very few guyz who managed to do an intern in both 2nd and 3rd year. First in Greenspace and second one in MS. During the summers when he was in Bangalore, my neighbour shifted somewhere else. So I tried to get him in that room and talked to Bala for that. But he put a condition that he will allow Maroo to shift only if his current room is vacated within 3-4 days. I said yes at that time not realising what have I accepted. Later when I entered his room, it took me some time to decide whether I should shift his belongings or not. It was a horrible scene to look at his room when you know you have to shift all of that stuff somewhere else. But I must confess that it was more my swaarth than desire to bring him in my neighbouring room. So I had to do that and I did. It took me 3 hours to select what all to take. I think this was among my wisest and most beneficial decisions <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Since then our friendship reached greater heights. He is my breakfast partner. I always talk to him when I'm upset and he is always there to help me. We had some great booze sessions. He is the other guy who always gets senti when drunk (I being the first one <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). He boasts of never puking after drinking  (itni kam peeta hai, ho hi nahin sakti <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I always tease him with some girl name and sometimes he gets angry also. He has some strange way of reacting to things. He just starts speaking very loudly and it looks like he is angry and ready to beat someone. But he says its not the case and its just his way of reacting. If someone points this out and says that he gets angry on every thing, he gets irritated like hell and actually gets angry. He could not even listen a wrong thing about him but this has changed a lot over time. Kisi ki bhi mar rahi ho, use hamesha pata hota hai kaise topic khudpe divert karna aur apni marwana. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> But this has changed a lot. I quit smoking because of him. <br><br>Contd....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One must have seen his dedication for CAT. He prepared extremely well for that but when the results were out, things didn't turned up in his favour. This disappointed a lot of people. But he performed brilliantly in his IIM-I interview (though he don not want to join it) and I pray that he should get an admission into IIM-I. Whether he joins or not, it does not matter but he should clear it. Actually I don't want him to join personally because he deserves more than this and will surely succeed if he'll give it a try next year. He always stand for his friends  and expects very much from his friends. But when he does not get the same, he get pissed off and so sometimes he is very difficult to handle. His anger is like on the tip of his nose. Gets angry very soon but it settles down more quickly. He cannot listen anything wrong.<br><br>Many more things to say... probably will come in another testi. For now, just want to say that its been a great journey with you and will miss you a lot (atleast he is placed in Hyd). I admire you for your dedication, sincerity, hard work and your friendly nature. From sometime back you have changed a lot. Hope you will not loose these qualities ever.<br><br>My <b>most memorable moments</b> with him would be the breakfast sessions right from the 2nd year and the "banana" one Club8 outing. <br><br>Good luck.

First being that my first name and his surname start with "Mar" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Secondly, he is a huge formula one fan and tifosi ( ferrari-fan ) just like me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I still remember those days when we used to chat during the formula one races, and how we wanted schumi to win and wanted to stab alonso <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He also liked some kind of hip-hop like fort-minor, my only partner in singing rap/hip-hop in a group where some people thought that Eminem sings rock <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> . <br><br> When I was in TB, he was the one of the first guys I wanted to be friends with.

<b><a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Madu ... One of the best all rounder in IIIT. Be it management, studies, BC or personal relationships.<br>Back in the first sem, I used to be in khatri's room for most of the times. He was just a couple of rooms away. The <br><br>image this guy had on me was .. the guy with thick glasses who always stick to his time table and keeps his room <br><br>dirty. We had a lot of hilarious BC sessions back then when we were leofying one or the other in the wing. Then the <br><br>TB formed and we became good friends. In second year we have had uncountable number of BC sessions ... going to <br><br>dinner daily and the dinner table BCs were awesome. I remember DISCO case when he was screwed by our profs ... I <br><br>din know what happened but I was so angry at the meeting at basketball court that I broke into tears <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ..<br>Newaz, this guy has a spirit to help friends selflessly.

I can't thank you enough for <br><br>that. from then we've been great friends. Then came the third year .. Mr coordinator ... the timetable guy hadled <br><br>everything perfectly .. The guy was so engrossed in felicity that he screwed his sem pointers.

<b><a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>His aptitude's range is truly formidable. He is one of the best all-rounder we have in our batch.  <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>The range of his abilities cut across all fields. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  He is a great student, <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> great blogger, great manager(he'll prove it to the world after getting MBA degree), <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> great sportsman and to top it all he is a great friend.  There is more to it but since I don't have such a great vocabulary to write all his great qualities, I can't write more. <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  But if I have to sum up all his qualities in one sentence I would say ..<br><br>He is not 'Jack of all trades' <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br><br><br><br>He is "The Master of all Trades" <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Character he resembles: Yohaan Awasthi in TZP <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Message for him: Don't forget me in future <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Peace. </b></i></ul><br><br>
