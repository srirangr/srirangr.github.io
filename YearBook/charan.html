<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 2<br><br> Charan is the only person on whom I confided the idea of Samvedana for the first time. He gave me the first push to proceed forward with this idea. He is the first to ask me to slow down, think back for being very unplanned and helped Samvedana is tredding on a better path. If Samvedana is  going great, its key functionary is you, Charan. Being a co-founder of Samvedana, the amount of efforts he is putting for making our dream - Samvedana so successful is truly commendable. <br><br>       Charan is one friend whom everybody It just helps in reinstating your lost faith in friendship. If I am what I am right now, what people term me as being strong, bold to take my own decisions, I truly owe to one person and that is you. Thank you for being such a great friend of mine.<br><br>       May you always get the best in life because you deserve every bit of it! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Part 1   <br><br>  Charan is undoubtedly one of my very few closest friends in -H. Its all hazy as to how we got together but I remember just one thing - at the end of first year, we were the closest of friends. I am glad that we did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He helped me <i></i> number of times and bailed me out of the crisis situations. I have never seen anybody more caring than our family but Charan is an exception. He goes an extra mile to help his friends. <br><br>      He is no human- sleeps at such odd hours, I dont know when he manages to get something into his stomach but I am sure 5 out of 7 days they go to a place somewhere near Punjagutta only to get some Dosas at 4:00 AM in the night. Yes, he is a great fan of non-vegetarian food and he goes somewhere in Mehdipatnam to get biryani.. Well, thats about food. Next comes how much he likes  <i> gaali tirugudu </i>. I remember how much he felt off when there was a restriction regarding the movement of people in and out of campus, though for only few days,<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .He was one of the most important pillar for Felicity'08 and is simply brilliant at organizing events, activities anything, you name it! He always has these amazing stories to narrate - about his life before he entered IIIT, his crushes, his  family.  <br><br>       We fell apart for some unfortunate reasons, we still spoke, but he changed a lot by then. But, Samvedana brought us together and I cannot express how glad I am for that. Charan was the first and probably the only person to whom I can ever tell anything that is in my mind because I am quite sure he is listening to me and is not making fun of the emotions.  He is not the kind of person who would lie to you so that you are happy. He has been one of my greatest critic and I sincerely thank you for that. <br><br>     </b></i></ul><br><br>

Ilaane Verizon lo kuda racha lepudam mama <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>He does all unorganized racha but when it comes to organizing, everything will be planned. I dunno how he manages everything so awesomely, inspite of being nocturnal <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Sleeps like a bull during the day time and works like a bat/owl during the night times. Also he's very caring and will always be the first one to come to the rescue.<br><br>We've played many mathces together and this guy was always a surprise. Someday he'd bat awesomely and on the very next day get out on a golden duck. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> . Same is the case with bowling too. And he;s never active during the fielding time. Well, whatever his surprising quality be, his presence would always make the match an interesting. Infact there were times when I even enjoyed the match which we lost. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Now coming to birthdays. OMG! He looks very small and all but saala, on the day of birthdays gets very active and kicks everyone's ass. Literally. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And on his own birthday he puts a face (like the cat in Shrek <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) so innocent and so childish that no one'd like to give him bumps. But his last birthday was a memorable one. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Well, there are many awesome moments to cherish but the most unforgettable moment was the time when I gave my interview and came back. He was sitting over there and just as he saw me he said "mama .. nuvvu ivvala ayipotav anthe.. room ki velli relax avvu". Actually I was not confident enough to believe it. And ya! ofcourse how can I forget taht he was the FIRST one to deliver the news of my placement. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif />.<br><br>ilaane kummuthuu undu mamaa ... all the very best for your future.<br><br>Love.<br>Ranga.</b></i></ul><br><br>

One canot understand him if you are not close to him. His acts differ by time and situation. I think he can become a great leader iff he overcomes his laziness. He is IIIT manmadhan. He every time tries to counter me, but every time he uses the same technique. I wish he will try differently. I thought of doing doing spoof for Billa with name Pilla. Here Cherry gadi ootha padam "aalta veesta" chinese lo deeni ardam " arey nidra vastundi ra lepakandi" . He gives great value to friendship and does anything for it.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first thing which comes to my mind when I think of this chap is "mass" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He is everything which defines the same- rugged looks, rough accent and the like. But when you get to know about this guy, you'll all agree that hes one helluva chap, a gem. I have never seen him turn down a request from a friend, or from anyone for that matter. Add to this his friendly demeanour, and you have one of the most popular guys in batch. Its that popularity which led him to an election win over his good friend and the other popular guy, Chand. <br><br>Charan was one of the most active guys during Felicity '08. Normally a lazy chap, it was wonderful to see his dedication for the fest. In fact, his role started right at the start of it all, when we were all trying to sort out the coordinator issue. Ultimately, his efforts towards a solution were very important. And it was wonderful to have him managing a good part of the thankless hardware business. I'll never forget the Felicity days mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>This guy always has a chillax attitude towards life, which leads to more than the requisite slackness from him in the first two years. However, over the last few months, hes put his priorities in order and life in perspective, as a result of which he really started working towards his academics. I have seen in him a genuine wish to do well, which is the first step to success. Having taken the first few steps, I am sure you'll do well in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Ravi Teja <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: You getting placed.<br>Message for him: Get out of your laziness <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
