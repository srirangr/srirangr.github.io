<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>...i guess i wrote the testimonial like a Critic<img src=Smileys/10.gif />...hehe..good for u...<img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>i never interacted much with him during the first 3 years apart from the lessons he gave me in guitar (sometimes)...used to see him only when i used to go to his room to meet sainani for some work. <br>...He is pretty good at guitar, taught me a few songs couple of times.<br>He can play guitar at any level but the worst part is, he cant even tune a guitar!!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ..hehe...and moreover I donno who gave him the idea of singing!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Anyways...he is very helpful person, very talented and friendly too.<br>...Plays Basketball, but i never saw him doing a basket though<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> but he likes playing it<img src=Smileys/1.gif />..thats nice. He's hard-working as is clear from his CGPA<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>We shared some common time, jogging early morning and in the gym, but it dint help him<br>much since it requires patience where as he wanted results overnight<img src=Smileys/1.gif />...<br>He helped me a couple of times during placements (when we used to be there in Alok's room) and i'm thankful for that...<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He's not good at managing money<img src=Smileys/1.gif />...one day he'll have 100's of bucks and the next day, everything's gone!<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Just few suggestions:<br>1) Plan for the Worst, Hope for the Best!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>2) Have Patience<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>3) Keep your room clean<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>You got a nice job and I wish you Best of Luck for Everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>ok..So it's my turn now...I'll be precise<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I interacted with Kapil during 2nd year when i was doing a project and required help in Java Swing. Since I dint know anything abt Java Swing at that time (..and i forgot everything now) i asked for his help. He helped me a lot<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> in that project. <br>...I havn't talked to him much but i know he's a very hard-working guy and works day and night to get something<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He helped me a couple of times during placements and i'm thankful for that<img src=Smileys/1.gif />...moreover he loves playing BasketBall, watching movies and other short movies (for something quick<img src=Smileys/4.gif />). We even had a great time jogging early morning and then working out in the Gym<img src=Smileys/3.gif />.<br>Just a few suggestions:<br>1) Change ur hairstyle from a chapati (flat) one<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>2) Keep your room clean<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>...You got a great job, you deserved an I wish you Best Of Luck for Everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I first met him in Kanpur where we were in the same coaching institute for IIT preparation. He generally used to come wearing a tshirt having a shoe design hanging from his shoulder<img src=Smileys/1.gif />(i still remember that). He used to just sit in the front and believe or not i never saw this guy studying hard<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> not even in the last 4 years<img src=Smileys/1.gif />in college (but he always get good grades..i donno how<img src=Smileys/7.gif />) and thats why when i saw him in IIIT on the first day in room no.119, i was surprized and said "Abe tu??...tu yahaan??"<img src=Smileys/4.gif />...but overall he's a very talented guy<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He's good in photography, loves reading novels and doing BC etc<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>..Well u got a nice job u deserved and i wish you Best of Luck for Everthing!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I havn't interacted much with him but he seems to be a nice guy, strange sometimes<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is quite helpful and taught me a couple of times!<img src=Smileys/1.gif />(i wont disclose the marks i got)<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>He does a hell lot of exercise, but luck doesn't work sometimes<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, anyways keep doing it!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I wud like to narrate one chatting incident:<br><i><br>Rahul: Hi<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Me: Hi<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Rahul: Kya tumhaare paas Maggi hai?<img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>Me: Nahi, mere paas Maa hai<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Rahul: But main Maa ko pakaa ke nhi khaa sakta!<img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>Me: Wohi to!<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Rahul: Baaye<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Me: bbye<br></i><br>...Well i'm sure u'll do well in your life and I wish you Best of Luck for everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>...and I wud like to add few positive points also. He is a very helpful  guy at times and he'll always help u when others might not be willing to<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. We studied for few courses together and it helped me(i donno how<img src=Smileys/7.gif />) including POPL (in which i got 'A') and Economics (in which i got an 'A-'. He surprisingly never refused whenever I wanted a printout from his lab (in case of Emergency<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).<br>        we used to had discussions on few strange topics related to psychology and human behavior (my fav. topics) while going to Indranagar etc.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        And he has this bad habit of sleeping during lectures due to which i'm sure he wud have suffered a lot at some point of time. I don't know whether he still has this habit or not since now i don't have any common subjects with him.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[testing] database is giving error message whenever i'm posting anything for him...so this is a test message<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I first interacted with him in 4th year while in OBH<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Had to go to his room for studying. I must admit here that his room is one of the most dirty and the most stinky rooms i've even gone to<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Sometimes i cant even take a single step inside his room, have to talk to him from outside<img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I hope he'll realise the importance of a clean room someday. <br>         I used to take him with me for jogging and gym, and it really helped both of us a lot<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>Overall he is a nice guy who 'tries' to look cool. He's Hard-working and very helpful. I owe him my placement prep. since he helped me a lot while placements and bringing me back to normal mode from an ultra-panic mode<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>         I'm sure you gonna do well in your life and I wish you Best Of Luck for Everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met him in first year and one day while we both were roaming in the campus, one of the immediate seniors (i wont disclose the name) came and took him aside to talk and when he returned he (the senior) said to another senior standing there, "He is the biggest tubelight of their batch!<img src=Smileys/10.gif />". We both just replied with a smile.<br>        He is simple, quite introvert (wont tell u much about his routine or any plans) which can<br>irritate u sometimes.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>         He speaks a lot of illogical things all the time (i guess unknowingly) just to gain people's attention. Well whatever makes u happy!<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. But i remember he once came to my room and asked me "Why dont anyone talk to me?" and i replied,"Are you sure you dont know the reason?"<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, well i think he knew it. <br>        I used to take him with me for my evening jog and it really helped us both a lot<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Overall he a great guy and loves watching his Naruto stuff and comics etc. <br>         Well i'm sure (actually i hope) you'll do something fruitful someday and i wish you Best Of Luck for Everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><b>NOTE: APPROACH HIM WITH CAUTION!</b><img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akshaysaad.html>Akshay Saad</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I first interacted with him in 3rd year during graphics assignment and i must admit that he is one of the most lazy and wierd guys i've ever met. He is simple, very moody at times (he suffers a lot due to this) and can be irritating also<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, but overall he's a great guy. Has a lot of interest in Computer Gaming and Reading good Books (me too<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).<br>         He was my BTP project partner (We both were about to take individual projects under Beza, when by coincidence we met outside Beza's office and thought of doing the project together. Well it really helped us bcoz the project got completed and we both dint came to know till the end, who among us actually did the project???<img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>         Well i'm sure you'll do well in your Life and I wish you Best Of Luck for everything<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I actually first interacted with him towards the end of 2nd semester, since i used to take a lot of help from him in Data Structure Assignments (to be precise i copied them from him<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). He is a great guy, simple but too much ideological and have lots of religious rules/restrictions on him<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (I sometimes feel how will he survive with so many restrictions<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).<br>         Anyways<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, I used to study in his room in the 2nd year with few others. Well it dint help me bcoz i wasn't used to group study, so i used to get screwed up<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> everytime.<br>         He is probably the most intelligent guy in the Electronics Stream in this college and he's pretty good in mathematics, its just that his luck doesn't work sometime<img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Well u can't be always lucky i guess!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        You'll surely do well in Life and i wish you Best Of Luck for everything!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>...and i want to add that PK helped me a lot in my placement by boosting my confidence<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> a couple of times(that really helped me a lot). After i came back from the placement party i gave, i regretted that i forgot to call you<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> So i owe u a party!<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>(...sorry for the spelling mistakes<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> in the previous testimonial, i'm not used to notepad<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> )</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>So finally a testimonial for PK. This guy is one of the very few perons I really admire and appreciate in this college. Not just becoz he a food freak or sth but becoz he a very simple, helping and down to earth kind of guy, has a great smile and is a treasure to have as a friend.<br>        I actually never interated with him in the first 3 years <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and to be precise I first interacted with him in 4th year when i shifted to OBH and found that he was mt neighbour!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        You'll mostly find him in hsi old rugged jeans, messed up hair and a big pack of chips in his hands...He is a great admirer (me too<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) of good movies and TV series and obviouly Junk Food!<br>        Since I used to go for a jog every morning, I asked him one day to join me and thought that may be i'll help him loose some weight (since he was concerned), But I seriously failed! This guy, no matter what happens, no matter how bad things turn up, can never stop eating junk food and all that oily-stuff!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        I mean how can a person eat 12 potato-stuffed parathas in breakfast or 24 sandwiches in breakfast??...phew!! ..unbelievable. I dont even understand whr does all that stuff goes! <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>        For about an entire month I used to wake him up and take him to Yuktahar mess with me for a good non-oily breakfast<img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>and then finally one day I saw him sneaking into his room with 2 big pack of American-Onion Lays! (the one he loves) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>But i guess no one can be Prefect! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>You got a great job u deserved and I wish you Best Of Luck for Everything!!<img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
