<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>PSSS - THe first image I pictured when I heard this name was of a dark, lean, not-good looking and a typical south pappu kinda guy. Well aaabviously I stand corrected. He is totally different from what I expected him to be. Fair, veryyy handsome, got a great smile...gotta confess he was looking just awesome on the Farewell day <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Of course...the rap written for him stands totally true <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I never really had a chance to actually talk to this chap but from what I know of him he is an extremely cool guy and yes...his English - toooo good man <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I really wish we talked more <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <br>All the best for your future dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramya.html>Ramya Yaragani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ramya - Another girl, the other being Sushma,  with many nick names with the most famous being Tiger Ramda (courtesy Harshita) and few others being rammi, rammiboy, etc <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is the googly gal of our batch. And she totally deserves it. She is the most studious girl of our batch. Until and unless she finishes all assts and projects as soon as they are given can she sleep or even breathe peacefully <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> In doing this, she has an amazing stamina - well...it is not an easy job to become Kirti Garg's (of all ppl) pet rt? <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Chicken, pizzas and thumsup are her fav, or shud I say, regular diet <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In these past 4 years only once did I see this girl drink a fruit juice and that happened just about 2 weeks back I guess <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She is a total sport and is always ready to go out at any point of time and more importantly she has an "awesome" sense of humor <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Her grip over Telugu lang, mainly on samethalu, is second to none <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> All the best for your job Rammi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>BhargavA - one of the friends Felicity 09 has given me. Thanks to Usability and Crop Production classes we became pretty close friends <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I tease to my heart's content but not once did he retort back or get serious. His answer has always been an ear to ear broad smile. He is a very sweet guy and it is always great fun to hang out with him. He is am ardent user of the gAlwaysidle <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I admire this lad for his awesome creativity <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  as if you guys didn't already know about it. Felicity video, Samvedana logo, our batch T-shirt, etc, etc, etc, speak it all for him <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He also has a very smart dressing sense - something "many" people adore him for <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And yes... more than his dressing sense there is something much better about him and that is his VOICE - a very deep and awestrikingly impressive voice. You would never think that a chap with such a lean physique can have such a great voice <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>    I am really glad that we became friends BhargavA. I wish all the very best for everything you take up <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I've heard about Sashidhar's superb sense of humor even before I met him. Once, back in 1st year, we were walking back to hostel after some class. He saw the big rock near library and said "This is a perfect example of IIIT rocks". I was totally dumbstruck. This was the first joke I heard him say and thought "after all, what I heard abt him is not false" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> We kinda drifter apart in the next two years but back in the 4th <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He has this typical way of talking and a characteristic gait with a bag slung down on one shoulder, stooped forward dragging himself down the road <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He is a very innocent guy and a child at heart. He just blabs anything that comes to his mind <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Many times, I've seen him lost in his own stream of thoughts. But when you are next to him he'll never let you get bored. He keeps entertaining me with his classic PJs <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I wish I knew more about this guy. Well...we have yet yanother year together. May be I will then. Good luck for your future Sashi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Naatha Tatineni - rather sweetly and shortly called Navs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is the all-rounder gal of our batch. Whatever gains her attention, she starts practicing it, she comes out in flying colors with such an ease - be it sports, games, athletics,  dance, acads, what not for that matter <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> She has quite an inborn talent for everything <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ...including sleeping <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She can sleep and sleep and sleep for hours together <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I spent quite some time in her room and can never forget the way we prepared for WDKM end sem exam - we slept till 8 in the morning <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> (plz don't assume that we were done reading by then) And can you believe it...even then she managed to get an A in that course <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Her dedication and contribution for Vayu house were commendable indeed <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> She, hardly ever, loses her temper with anyone. A fellow FRIENDS-freak <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Ang yeah...she's gonna be a New Yorker. Congratulations on that Navs <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br>    I will, for ever, treasure all the laughs we had. I wish you all the best for all your future ventures. I'll miss you a lot.<br>Love u loads Navs <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>bkreddy...naaku Devudicchina tammudu <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> The first time I came to know about this guy was through my mother (he's her colleague's son)She used to go on and on and on about how hard working he was and what nice and silent guy he was with all his meditation camps in summer. oohh...how I used to curse him under my breath <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> I was so jealous of him I had no idea we would become such good friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> When I first met him in IIIT he was Osho freak. At one point of time, he decided to drop b.tech after 4th yr and join a similar community kinda thing <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Thank Goood...He dropped that idea later. He is a veryyyy sweet guy. He has immense respect for his friends. He'll go to any end to do something for them. He had (am not sure abt now) a mini hotel in his room. If anyone was hungry at any point of time they would come running to this guy's room and he would cook for them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Not only a cook, he is an awesome cricketer too <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He keeps tellin us abt all his matches. He used to ask us to come and watch his matches but since they were all on weekends, I could never make it to them expect for the laaaast inter-batch finals. He is one of the few guys that I know of who are pretty balanced and don't lose his temper quickly. We had some really great times going for walks, chatting till dawn, going out for dinners <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I'm really glad that we have at least one more year to spend together. I am really proud to have a friend/brother like you bk.<br>Love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>Divya <br><br>PS: Initially, this guy was normal but I donno what change 4th year brought about him, but hez been working like a DAWG lately <img src=Smileys/26.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>IIIT ki ragane ee NKP saruku Spandana Gella ninchi Spandy ayipoyindi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>      Spandy...the very utterance of this name gushes back all her jokes to my memory. She's got this Oh-dear-Lord sense of humor. You might think this is an exaggeration but nooooo...you have to be there to believe it. Hear her jokes and kill me if you are not stupefied. I'm always awestruck with the level of complications involved in her jokes <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Sometimes she had to explain how she actually came up with that joke and that joke actually meant <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> There are few classics that have left our minds scarred forever...like the Pushdown Automata, Aditya 369 (this one was actually good <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ), chandramukhi, pushpa-this one is the latest (oh yesss...we have actually titled these classics <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ). We also had this idea of creating a community of all the PJs dedicating it to her but I don't know why but we never put that into practice (yeah...now, too, is not too late <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) The moment she cracks a joke, you can always see her blushing with a wide grin and Anu next to her clapping and encouraging her <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> But I must confess Spandy, our lives at IIIT wouldn't have been this great and lively without you and your sense of humor <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br>      Along with this awing sense of humor, God has also gifted this lass with tons of sweetness. She is an amazing friend. She has a lot of patience and is always very helpful and caring. She is very dedicated and sincere to her friends and acads...Yes, she is a very hard-working gal. <br>    <br>    Hey Spandy...I will always cherish the time we spent. You are a real person for me. Wish you all the good luck in the world and success in all your future plans. Be the way you are...You are just amazing. Will miss you and your jokes. Love you lots spandy <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Srirang is the personification of the word "CUTE". Cute is what he is; cute is what he does; cute will he remain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> You ought not miss his facial expressions when someone calls him "cute" <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Till Felicity '09, this guy was just some guy in our class. But after just one small chat on the 3rd day of Felicity we became very close friends. It is always hell-lotta fun hanging out with him. He never lets his company get bored; not for a sec. We have great time pulling each others' leg. Tease him how much ever you want never does he takes it to heart. He is a real sport. He always walks with a very wide smile on his face. The best memory I've shared with him was a certain chat <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is, also, a great singer - pretty famous for the Masakali song <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is a total raccha candidate - be it felicity or cultutral night he would always be in the last row and create a Oh-Dear-God kinda havoc. He is the most active guy I've ever known. He has the greatest number of friends. And he gives a great value to all his friends. His testimonials speak all that for him. He is a total movie buff. He has a great song collection. He is always humming something or the other wherever he is <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I'm just sad I met such a wonderful guy only about 3 months before he leaves and not 3 yrs ago <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I can never forget the time we spent together. I really wish to stay in touch with you Ranga. All the very best for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Lydia Manikonda...The first words that heard her say were "Please don't make fun of my name" to a senior during interaction session. She is the Ms.Keep-my-room-clean of our batch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Everything in her room has to be in the right place and sparklingly clean - and this rule is pertained only to her room (remember the cake on the wall lyddi?? <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> There was this one incident when she accidentally stepped on a dog in front of GH. You won't believe what she did - she asked me to get dettol from her room, cleaned her feet in the common bathroom and only after that did she go into her room <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> She even has this "Please leave your footwear outside" note on her door <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> And when she walks she walks like she runs <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> This might give some people an impression that she is one of that serious kinda breed. Noooo...she is actually a sweetheart. She always has this a very pleasant smile and always greets you whenever you cross paths with her however busy she might be.We had some great times playing badminton in the 1st yr. I don't actually remember why we stopped playing but she blames me for that <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Also the trip to Bombay was a very memorable time we had with all jokes about the rooms, trains and the photo session we had in the conference hall. It was just too good <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Initially, she a liiiittttle conservative but her trip to Australia has made her a super cool gal. She is very sincere in every work she does. She doesn't copy her assts <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> , she is the only one that I know of who is against the proxy policy <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> She is always enthusiastic to learn new things. And yeah...she is a very good throwball player <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>     I wish you aaaalll the very best future plans. Love you lots lyddu <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samantapudi.html>S.Rama Krishna Raju</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Samanthapudi Raju...Never really talked to him till 4-2. Felicity was the time when I started properly talking to him. It was about the AKAPAKA skit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He was supposed to dance for some song from Gajini. Ayyagaaru practice ki kuda goggles pettukuni vacchesevadu <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> But he is a very sweet and silent guy. He is my tutor for DC course. I keep torturing him for help in assts and exams. And never did he say anything but smile and help. He has great levels of patience <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I wish you all the very for your future and do stay in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br> <br>PS: Album lo 1st photo cheti lo gulabi puvvu pattukunte "Malleswari" lo venkatesh photo la untundi (Nuvvu venkatesh la untavani kadu...photo pose ala untundani <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Contd...<br>    She is the one to crown me with the name "Baava" and now hardly anyone calls me by my name <img src=Smileys/14.gif /><br>    I can never forget the long talks and short one-liners we have all the time. It was always great fun being around you expect when you bug me to switch off the fan and light in my room <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>    I'll miss you and your *** jokes a lot <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Please do come over during weekends. You can stay in my room...yaas it eees nee room laage unchuta <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Love you lots deeps <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Phanideepthi Ghadiyaram...yes people...that's the name!! She just loooooves to be called to be called by that name <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> She is the girl who has changed THE max since she came here. From the geeky girl, Phanideepthi Ghadiyaram, in the 1st year she became this ultracool "yo dude" gal, Deepti.You won't believe how she was in the 1st 2 yrs.Always captured in her own bubble of studies and yeah...dance <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Plz do pester her for "that" video <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And the total awesome thing abt her was during exams, she always a certain black dress for ALL the exams - be it mids or ends <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> And there is one thing more memorable than her dance - during Jeevan vidya session in 1st yr someone drew a clock against her name in the attendance sheet - It was total ROFL. I don't know what got into her head in the 4th yr - there came this major transformation abt her with all new hairstyle and a completely new westernized wardrobe <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> And THE best thing she is at is cracking *** jokes. I don't know how she can picture "it" in every damn situation <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        Above(deep deep down below) all this crap, she is a very sincere and immensely matured girl. She is still(with all her imaginations in her head <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) very dedicated to and amazingly good at her acads. Ofcourse, her CG, her Google Women engineerin award say it all for her. And I respect her a lot for giving up her MS for the sake of Samvedana <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I mean, it is not a small thing to make it to the cover story of the most popular magazine in AP <img src=Smileys/41.gif />...Isn't is Spoorthi? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>      There are many people in our batch who have met with a couple of accidents and been rushed to the hospital. But the winner iiiiisssss...Phanideepthi Ghadiyaram!!! <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>PS: She competes with me...no, actuall, she beats me in keeping  her room neat and tidy <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ambati.html>Bharat Ram Ambati</a></b>&nbsp;<br>And yeah... I forgot to mention this in the prev one- He has an awesome laptop which "never" troubles him and "NEVER EVER" did he have to go to the service centre <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ambati.html>Bharat Ram Ambati</a></b>&nbsp;<br>DAWG...yes...that is what he is <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> You can always find either doing some work or thinking about it. He is the KING of LTRC lab. Can you believe it...he already has 3 publications <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He is also punctual in all other project work he has right from Adv.Cog Sci reports to his research work. He cannot be at peace if there is some unfinished job. He is irritatingly dedicated to his acads <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I am not sure if I admire this guy or envy him for this <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But within this DAWG, there is a very sweet guy who always walks with a smile on his face, who always greets everyone he knows in a very cheerful tone. He is also a very very helpful guy. Never says "no" to anything. Ask him something and he will go out of his way to help you finish it and NOT ONCE will he be tired of doing it. Whenever I try to pull his leg he does not nothing smile and grind his teeth <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And yeah..he is a key member of the "Yaram's counters' fan club" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is the one of the few good friends I have in IIIT. The bane this guy has is that any girl he talks has a strong inclination to make him her brother <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But I doubt if this guys considers it a boon or a bane <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> because I think he is equally fond of making sisters than friends <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is very sincere and very honest in every relationship he maintains. He is,at times, neck-stranglingly irritating but his sweetness makes it a minuscule thing leaving him alive till date <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>I hope you achieve all that you have in your agenda. And I really hope we have a great time next year. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If asked to pick someone to spend time with on a deserted island, Namrata would be my first choice. This girl always has something or the other to talk about. She talks about anything from Federer to her cousin's grandfather <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She never lets her company get bored. I can never forget the joke she told us in Sushma's room in 1st year. I laughed so hard and for so long that I, literally, had to clench my stomach to control the pain. She is the smartest girl I've ever met. The range of general knowledge she has really amazes me. She keeps herself updated with everything - be it TV shows or sports or film industry or even stock market <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. She is a die hard fan of Roger Federer and the Liverpool team. I still can't believe that she ACTUALLY cried when Federer lost a match. Also, a co-FRIENDS freak <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> She watches almost all the tv shows available in DC <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> With all this in her head, she is surprisingly good at acads. She takes her work real serious and puts her blood into it. And yeah, this girl's got a wonderful english and admirable communication skills. The way she picks her phrases and forms her sentences is really awesome <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. All-in-all, she is a very sweet "kid" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the very best for your future plans nammu and i'm sure u'll in everything you put your heart into.

<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sushma...she is hardly called by this name. She has the most number of nick names and the greatest number of paradies written on each of her nick names. She's the Mother India of her batch <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Most of us go to her in trouble times and she is always ready with a helping hand. She is our "go-to" girl. I don't know how but people who don't know her really well also melt down in her magic. Important point to note is that her mood swings like a pendulum <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Give her 4 secs...In the 1st sec she is a kewl gal, in the 2nd sec she is all moody and gets philosophical, in the 3rd sec she loses her temper and in the 4th sec she is a very cute and innocent girl who wants to be petted by everyone <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Yeah yeah...it an exaggeration, of course <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She is amazingly dedicated to work. Whatever you do she is not going to get down from her work unless and until it is done and that too in the best manner possible. She goes out of her way to help someone in their acads...from self-experience <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is a bermuda triangle in terms of pens...give her one and you can never get it back <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I've known this girl for the past 5 1/2 years and she owes quite a number of stationery things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> As anu calls her...she is like a radio. When she starts off talking there is no stopping her. She can go on and on for hours together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Oh yeah...she has a great talent as a lyricist. When she doesn't remember the lyrics of a song she fills in some random word in that place and the best part is that it blends so well with the song that you cannot, sometimes, even notice the difference. She is my oldest friend in IIIT and the friend I respect the most. I am extremely sorry for hurting you sussu <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I really regret it and i will treasure our friendship forever. You will always hold a special page in my life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This girl is a total freak. Her daily routine goes sth like getting up early in the morning (which is the thing i hate about her <img src=Smileys/10.gif />), gym/jog, breakfast, bath and then lab and more exercise in the evening. And yeah...there should a continuous flow of songs all this while. She is the firebrand of our batch. She's got an awful lot of friends. Believe me...She smiles and waves to every other person she sees...and it's no exaggeration!!! Such is her network <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. She is supremely fun to be with. I don't know how but she always manages to brighten up the atmosphere. When you are with her, you just want to go crazy and do all those things which you were always shy to do. Also, she is wonderful company for gossiping <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. These days you can see her working out either in the gym or in the lab. Everything about her is so wonderful....Her face is always lit up with her super cute grin...shez got great hair <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />...great complexion...A-class dressing sense and ,of course, shez a God level singer <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And before i forget...There are 3 things in this world she loves the most - her brother, dresses and ear-rings. She's got a wonderful collection of the latter <br><br>two...no comments on the first one <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>All-in-all....She is one of the best friends IIIT gave me. She is the most zealous person I've ever met...Way to go harsaaaa!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Basically, she is a localite <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>She is THE best example for "looks can be deceptive". When you look at this girl, you can't help but believe that she is a very timid and extremely innocent girl (this is mainly because of her super cute lips with a super cuter smile always dancing on them)<br><br>Though this is partly true, there is another side of Anu which not many people are lucky enough to witness. When she pulls off her mask of that innocent version, you can see that fun-filled edition of hers. She has the most awesomest sense of humour. When in her company, you can never feel bored. You don't know how the times flies by when starting chatting with her. The thought that "we have been talking for such a long time" will never cross your mind. Instead you can't help but wonder "have we been for such a long time??!!" and you won't regret it even a single bit. She is a total movie buff (does this word ring any bells anu?? <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We had, and still have, some great laughs with some dialogues. She is (watch it...not "HAS" but "IS") the biggest telugu songs' database <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  You don't have to even name the song...just give her a few words from it and you can already hear her singing it for you with a wide grin. Also, she has a mind-blowing interest in photos...not taking them but being in them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All this doesn't mean that she does nothing but watch movies and listen to songs. She is a girl who is very dedicated to her work. She does all her assignments and project work very sincerely. And she won't breathe peacefully until she finishes her work.<br>And shez got this unique (as she calls it...we call it sth else though <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) taste for guys. She has this major crush on a guy for about 3 years now but is still stuck at the square one.Anu...if you aren't going to act upon it in the next two months, then we, as your friends, have to handle the matter <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>To sum it up, she is the most wonderful person I met in IIIT and really want to us to be the same friends forever...Love u ya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
