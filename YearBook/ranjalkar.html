<b><a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Popularly known as D.J. Ranga, Sri<b>rang</b> is really a colourful personality and has been like a personification of cheerfulness over the past four years. Not once did I find him gloomy. [I hope you never were, and wish never will be] The pic here speaks all about the person [No matter which pic he uploads, the vibrant energy and the cheerfulness will always be reflected <img src=Smileys/4.gif />]<br><br>He is one of those rare people in college who never misunderstood me and I always felt a soothing calmness about him, something that conveyed to me - <i>"Don't worry, everything will be fine. Look at me, it's not very tough to feel happy, to smile <img src=Smileys/1.gif />"</i>. Thanx for always being there for me as a friend, and for all those encouraging words you spoke to me every time I either was going to perform or had performed on stage and of course for that wonderful testimonial you wrote for me. You are one person whose admiration always encouraged me a great deal <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Bhai Ranga, you have the gift of spreading joy through your ever so charming and refreshingly simple attitude <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Keep putting it to good use as you have been doing for the last four years.<br><br>Aur kya likhun, to summarize it all -- <b> "Humare Pyare Chalte Firte Smiley <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> Hamesha Smile Karte Rehna <img src=Smileys/6.gif />" </b></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>If my life in college has been a roller coaster ride, he has been my seat belt. If my life through these four years is a photograph, he is the light. If my life in IIIT-H is a cake then he would be the cherry on top of it. We are brothers in arms. We have been together since our first years. We shared the same PC in workspace. We used to sit next to each other in classes. In first two years we were in different hostels but in the latter two we were in the same. Though we shared a great bond in first two years. It is the second half of college life with him that I would cherish forever. A lot has already been said about him and I see no point in wasting characters to say all those things again. You know when you see a mirror and you think that you know yourself very well. Thats how he is to me. I see him and I know his mood. I think the time we have spent together gave us powers to recognise even the hidden feelings that we would otherwise hide from everyone else. I just want you to know that the moments spent with you have been great and wonderful. I wish that we be in the same city and always be together as we have been. After all, we are brothers in arms.<br>May God shower you with choicest of his blessings.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I first met him during first practice of fresher's dance. His cheerful and always smiling attitude was the first thing that made me like him. His skills equally impressed me as and when he showcased them (be it dancing, singing,<br>DJing, or just being himself!)<br>I remember more than once Srirang coming to our room and asking me and Atul if we would be interested in going out for watching a movie and we three have been to movies more than once, deciding everything instantaneously! It was<br>fun, saw Dhoom2 in black <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> We've also had some music sessions together which was fun.<br>He and Sharat were the coolest roommates I have met. I go to his room and he starts imitating and speaking some dialogues which is quite funny and Sharat laughs his heart out... its a place to be in, always a joyland!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Initially when I saw him and interacted with him, he reminded me of Uday Chopra. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (no offence meant, in case you don't like him!)<br>I remember sharing stage with him during a group dance on two occasions and it was a<br>pleasure. Watching him play tunes of songs for the first time without looking at the notes on a keyboard was also a pleasure and amazing! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I am glad we are in same house, Agni!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I have always enjoyed his company and our latest joint venture was inter-house dumb charades, in which our team (Srirang, Deepti and me) reached till the second round, but it was fun.<br>I don't think I'll ever be able to forget or would want to forget your smiling face, your cool attitude is perfect, not a careless one but the one which gives just one message, "keep smiling and mean it!" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his ability to smile whatever the situation be, and his DJing skills ! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Love you DJ<br><br>P.S. don't you feel blue after seeing this mini version. You know me, you've my number and you can knock on my door at any time, any fuckin' time, yeah. We'll create an absolute riot.<br> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Srirang aka DJ ranga !!!<br><br>This guy truely makes justice to the line "Can't be ignored", as far as I know hes been friend of each one of the 176 students of our batch<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> which is undoubtably a great feeling. <br><br>In IIIT, Dj nights can't be complete without this guy. I never talked to him in the first couple of year but when we moved to OBH in 3rd year then we started to know each other, I found he is a cutipie baby, very jovial in nature who always keeps smile on his face. I often go to his room to eat something, banda humesha pura khane ka saaman khol ke rakh deta hai... thanks range for all those sweets and namkeens that I ate at your room.<br><br>seriously dude you are a great guy !!!!<br>may you fly higher in your future !!!!<br>keep in touch!!! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Jab bhi main isko dekhta hoon, ek bahut hi strong, positive, bubbling si vibe mujhe hit karti hai. Main andar se khush ho jaata hoon, aur mera dil kehta hai ki vaah! kya awesome banda hai!<br><br>Ranga aur main Agni mein ek saath the. Althought he lived in the Vayu section of the hostel, somehow he came into agni. And how it was good for us! Because in our Agni batch of 26 people, had there been no Ranga, we would probably have gone without participation in many inter house events. Ups came and downs came, but Ranga was always there for Agni, and by implication, me. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>During placements there were a few people who managed to remain chilled out. Most of them were were like, those who had had startup plans and were just appearing for jobs as a backup. And then there were the miniscule minority, who were simply too much at peace with themselves and chilled out from within to let it get on to their nerves too much. They knew they will ultimately get a decent job, so why bother. Ranga fell into the latter category. Ser, haven't seen a more cool guy than him!<br><br>The period after placements has seen Ranga come of age. He had been the apple of every eye since the first year itself, being a multi cultures and multi lingual person and all, but now, with no worry on his head at all, he's like, unleashed his animal spirits on the whole batch! No joke, no party is ever complete without DJ Ranga's effusive DJ spirit filling the place with positive vibes. He has unleashed his artistic creativity everywhere, be it singing, dancing on chairs in the audience, writing rap numbers, clicking pics and getting pics clicked, or simply playing some prank or the other on his gang. <br><br>If I could ever get inside his head, I would like to know from where comes so much positivity, so much goodwill, so much wit and so much simplicity. Whenever he laughs, it's like you can see his soul through it. It'll be interesting to know whether he holds some sneaky, underhanded thought inside him or not. It really, really looks all clean and pure to me.<br><br>One more word, he's damn intelligent. Just more chilled out than intelligent.<br><br><b>Fav Memories:</b> Reading for Soft Computing, the various Agni activities.<br><b>Will remember you for: </b>The DJ spirit.<br><br>Cheers!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

But after just one small chat on the 3rd day of Felicity we became very close friends. It is always hell-lotta fun hanging out with him. He never lets his company get bored; not for a sec. We have great time pulling each others' leg. Tease him how much ever you want never does he takes it to heart. He is a real sport. He always walks with a very wide smile on his face. The best memory I've shared with him was a certain chat <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is, also, a great singer - pretty famous for the Masakali song <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is a total raccha candidate - be it felicity or cultutral night he would always be in the last row and create a Oh-Dear-God kinda havoc. He is the most active guy I've ever known. He has the greatest number of friends. And he gives a great value to all his friends. His testimonials speak all that for him. He is a total movie buff. He has a great song collection. He is always humming something or the other wherever he is <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I'm just sad I met such a wonderful guy only about 3 months before he leaves and not 3 yrs ago <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I can never forget the time we spent together.

Whenevr he comes in our wing, he leaves a smile on our faces. sab yahi bol rahe hote hain ki "mast banda hai". Bahut bada bcbaaz to hai hi <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . My first memory of him goes back to first year when all of the novices were preparing to dance on stage. This guy is quite sharp as he learnt many dance steps quite easily and quickly. Chota sa banda hamesha hasta muskurata rehta tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Us time iske saath bc karne mein khoob maza aaya. But then most of our interaction happened in third and fourth year when I moved to OBH. One of the most memorable events with him is taking his special photograph with pk in his wing <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Us din iski khoob maari thi. But somehow, that photograph got lost. Then one is antyakshari conducted by him in Pagare's wing. It was fun. Then doing bc with him in mota's room where we all were reading fattas on discussion forum and trying to create some new ones. That Ringa thing also came out there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , remember? Then the most memorable one is booze party given by juniors to our batch. He was out in that and then because of some reason, I said "tu awesome banda hai yaar" and then he reverted back with the reply "jo khud awesome hota hai, use sab awesome lagte hain" and made some law regarding that. Then he told me that he drank only because he wanted to cry. Almost 150 people are going to separate their ways after some days and he is getting a bit senti and hence, he drank so that he could cry and I saw that tears were coming out of  his eyes.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Whenever he would meet me he wud open up with a friendly conversation, a cute smile flickering alwayz on his face.<br><br>Then in second year..I had the pleasure to go with him for Kerala trip.

<b><a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>DJ Ranga. The first image that comes to my mind after hearing this name is the ever smiling cute little fella <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. The most bindaas guy of our batch whom I have never seen getting tensed or angry over anything at all and handles every situation with his bubbly nature. <br>The one thing that really brought us closer was the Batch trip in Dec'07. Before that he was just another guy from the batch who was friends both with the people from north and south. But seeing his energy and enthu while composing songs for the P-band and his extremely friendly nature I felt like banda to apne type ka hi hai, apni isse bahut jamegi. Most memorable moment during that trip would be his abrupt ending of the song 'Chandu ke chahcha (p-version)' which made all of us <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . <br>Another incident that is still fresh in my mind is the booze session on 3rd night of Felicity'08. He was probably the only non-drunkard among the whole lot there and was a bit scared seeing people do some wacky things out there. Still remember the expressions on his face when I asked him to try the RDB-style from roof top, he was like WTF ! <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> Was an awesome experience teasing him that night. But thanx Range for handling that situation calmly and sorry if I had said anything offensive to you that night. <br>A total BC baaz and quite a good singer. His Masakali performance during Felicity'09 was fun to watch <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. A mobile library of songs and movies, just name any song or movie and he will come up with complete details of it which is indeed commendable. <br>Lots of memorable moments with him in these four years like - Batch trip in 2nd year, midnight snacks in his room watching movies like One Two Three, swimming sessions in Feb, the frequent Hi and Bye that we exchange from our respective wings, antakshari in 270s wing and many more.<br>It feels great to have such a nice, cute and dear friend like you<img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>All the best Range for your future.

He is always bubbling, bursting, bamboozzaling (dont even know if this is a word) with energy, always ready for a session of BC and fun anywhere, anytime with anybody. If ever there was a competition for the most friendly guy in IIIT, Ranga would win hands down, the guy talks to each and every freaking person in the batch, at times I am amazed how could he be talking to so many people. You name any guy in the batch and he will talk about him as if he were one the best friends of the guy, a fact quite evident from the large no of testimonials he has got.

<b><a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>contd...<br><br>I still remember the reaction he had on his face when he was listening to that song. That night we listened to that song atleast 30 times! We planned so much for the video, the dance steps, the scenes; i actually wrote down what should be done at what time, how and where the scenes have to be shot, the camera movements and the effects, in a book! We were that serious about<br>making it. Well we still have some time left. Hopefully we'll be able to make it! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>But he gets really lazy at times, sometimes too lazy to even go to mess! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and gives lame excuses like i had a heavy breakfast and stuff <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> i guess he's secretly dieting! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I've been an introvert all these years! didnt really share things close to my heart, be it happiness or sorrow, with anyone! But of late, i've changed and started to be more open. I dont really know why but i've been sharing a lot of things with our gang, especially ranga! Had so much happening in my life lately, he's been a great listener <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sharing all those good things with him has made us even more close friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Anything, good or bad he would be the first person to know!<br><br>aah! want to write so much more da! but telling all this and saying "you rock mama! all the best for your future!!" makes it sound like you'll be going away to some other place! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Me waiting for your appointment letter da! We need to go house hunting as soon as it's confirmed that you'll be posted in hyd! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I can already imagine the fun we'll be having staying in an apartment <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>It was because of sharat (ranga was his roomie) that i've started talking to him. Although we had very little interaction in the first 2 years, i'm glad we've become close friends in a short time! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And boy! this guy's full of energy! There's never a dull moment when he's around and it's such a gift to be so much fun and totally entertaining irrespective<br>of the place and time! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Our gang wouldnt have had all those fond memories and aaahsome outings if he wasnt there!<br><br>His knowledge on hindi music and movies is amazing. He actually remembers the "release dates" of many hindi movies. That's crazy!!! Who the eff remembers<br>that sorta info about a movie!?!? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> If he's in your team, whether it's antakshari or DumbC, you can be sure that the other team would sweat! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We had so<br>much fun playing antakshari and dumbC on the new building! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's like the Bollywood encyclopedia!<br><br>Everyone knows he doesnt get pissed off easily and you rarely see him get "really" angry. But i have the reputation of pissing off even the coolest people.<br>I've pissed off almost everyone in our gang, even ranga! It was during placements and he wasnt in a good mood after writing an exam and i was repeatedly<br>saying something and at one point it really ticked him off! But the great thing about him is he forgets things like these very quickly and gets back to his<br>usual fun self in a blink! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>For the last couple of months he kept saying, "i'm bored da!" all the time. He got tired of staying in his room i guess and always wanted to do something! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Thanks to him these last days have been more fun and exciting than usual. We planned to do so much, but again my laziness and the work i got myself entangled to sorta stopped all those plans from being implemented. I remember the first time i listened to "Harilo ranga hari" song from Billa, i ran to his room, downloaded it silently and made him listen to it. I was like "ranga!! this song was created just for you".</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>To start with he is a very amiable person I think this is his charm that made him to connect almost each n every person of our batch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I first met him in second year while playing cricket in gheb, I kinda remember that day ...yes, its our Republic Day, He wore this saarang t-shirt holding a carry bag in his hand and greeting everyone. From then the era began...and guess wat it will be continued outside IIIT too. I will never forget those days when we have done our OS assignments together,dude how come we didn't had a project together?...and we have done lots of stuff like crawling orkut for cute pics....this is  when orkut didn't had restrictions on user's pics..orkut now sucks!. <br><br>we share many common interests like playing online games solving puzzles n ofcourse sudoku. I never known till recently that he is good at GK. <br>He is also quiet good when it come to other than acads.  He sings n dances to his tunes....plays piano, he has one in his room. Am I forgetting <br>anything? Yeah! he is a very very good narrator, one never gets bored in his company. <br><br>we share many funny experiences together and its all been abt our dear sharbat<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> whenever we feel bored we just knock his door and then it begins...<br>I will never forget the "helmet" joke.<br><br>finally wat i want to say is u rock<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and I wish we both share a classroom again in near future<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>We often get provoked or think about getting back at our adversaries for shit they would have done. But 'anger' and 'enemy' are two words which are <br>non-existent in DJ Ranga's dictionary. You'll never see him get wild at anyone or anything. Instead, he meets every situation with his famous bubbly spirit and energy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Ranga is someone who can instantly liven up the atmosphere. He always tries to provide entertainment, be it by his wit, or a game of antakshari. I've seen that he often takes the initiative to do so, and that is so very sweet of him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Case in point, the journey during batchtrip. <br><br>That spirit also comes from the basic friendly nature of Srirang. Hes a friend in need, and a friend indeed. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's also active in the college and its affairs, especially in the cultural field. I remember the various treasure hunts Vig and he organised. Besides, he is a very lively singer with a terrific stage presence. Even in spite of a lot of competition, he is likely to beat it because of the charm and liveliness he brings to the stage. Another thing which comes to my  mind is that he's our very own Mr. Bollywood. Any song or movie, hes not just likely to know, but also have an opinion. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I remember doing the ITWS project together, and it was fun. Sachin sir ka kaatne mein maja aata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . And yeah, thanks for delivering the IIM-I news to me mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I remember, you just screamed out in happiness, and I owe you a treat for that!<br><br>May God bless you!<br><br><b>Character he resembles: The various characters of Govinda <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Fav memory: Batch trip onward journey<br>Message for you: Never change your basic nature dude. You're awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=vrktavva.html>Tavva Rajesh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>ranga... when u think of him you will immediately remember these qualities... funny, cheerful, either dancing or singing or trying to provide entertainment in some or other form - be it jokes or actions or dialogues - anything <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>He is one guy who is enough to make the environment around you lively and cheerful. Hats off to you ranga and I wish you will be cheerful like this forever <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One and only one, DJ Ranga. Absolutely exclusive qualities he possesses. I have never seen him angry or unhappy during my stay in IIIT. He makes whole wing laugh, I mean hostel, with his quick and witted jokes. He is on spot singer and a walking dictionary of films, songs, directors etc. I came close to him only after our maiden journey to kerala. It was a wonderful trip, wonderful becuase of our beloved ranga, who sang non-stop from Munnar-Periyar. <br><br>Ranga, it has been a wonderful journey of 4 years with you. I am happy that you have stood with me for every decision I have taken. We have shared every moment of happiness. Few things which make you stand apart from the crowd in your jolly and selfless nature. Be the same for ever. <br><br>I had done the count++ when you were placed in Hyderabad for our next adventure trip <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Srirang aka DJ Ranga...The Wikipedia for Music and Movies<br>He is a very enthusiastic, cool, trustworthy person and u can always see him with a big smiling face. One can never feel bored if he is in ranga's company.. he will always be thr to entertain u <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. <br><br>I talked to him for the first time while we were organising Treasure Hunt.. from thr on we were good friends. Kudos to our friendship <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is really the best in making clues. I could never have thought of the clues the way he thinks and makes them. He is such a talented, cool and friendly person that every time I have to organise an event.. the first person comes to my mind as a partner is Ranga. <br>We enjoyed a lot while making clues for Treasure Hunt and Cachein .. we have spent many nights roaming in each and every part of the campus searching for the places whr we can hide the clues. In cachein .. I came to know that he is also very dedicated person <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... he spent a whole night in solving a big matrix question. <br><br>The most unforgetable moments is the trip to Kerala. It was so much fun and as usually he was entertaining the whole batch of 11 people with his songs and bc <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Thr was never a single moment for which we felt bored .. its all because of Ranga. <br><br>And now we both are in same company .. we will surely organise a treasure hunt(if possible) thr.<br>Best of luck for the Future and always be like what u r .. will the same smiling face. Its gr8 to have u as my colleague <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=nvkartheek.html>MNV Kartheek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br> Ranjalkar aka D J Ranga ...I have never seen him without a smile on his face. One would seldom feel bored when he is around, Maruti has put in a better way "ticket to infinite bc". <br><br>   I still remember the cricket matches in the previous summer, we had a lot of fun. He has invented a very special technique to get the batsman out, "bowl three wides before a right one" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> That is just an example for the infinite creativity this guy has. He is an "awesome" story teller.<br> "Ranga nuvvu bumper ehe" <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br><br>   </b></i></ul><br><br>

The best thing about him is that whenever you be with him, you also feel the same energy. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The GOD has bestowed him with many qualities - a melodious voice, a beautiful smile (even you can see that in his profile pic), a great heart, perfection in speaking multiple languages, etc, etc.  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> It's very difficult for me to even dream of last four years without him. He is the one among the few who has amicable relations with everyone in our batch. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I must say, he is the one who represents our batch. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> All the four pics pasted above which have RANGA in common, justify the same. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>I can't ever forget the trip to Ooty which strengthened our friendship. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I have many beautiful memories along with him. I can't write them all.<br>I wish you a VERY GOOD LUCK for your future endeavours. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and at the end ..<br>HUM HAIN RAHI PYAAR KE ..... phir milenge CHALTE CHALTE <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>DJ Ranga as he is popularly known as, is really really full of energy. He is the only person i think who is good friends with every one. Where ever there is a party you are sure to have ranga there. A great artist, be it DJing or singing. Plays wonderful keyboard. <br>He really adds fun to anythings. BC karne main ustad hai.

<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Laxmi Bomb?? Nahin 100 ki ladi ?? ... Nahin yaar Atom Bomb ?? nahin ... Nuclear Bomb, I am unable to find a fitting comparison for ranga's energy level. He is always seen singing/dancing/jumping/ or doing raccha !  <br><br>  This guy over here is a ticket to infinite BC and enjoyment. Don't underestimate the size of ticket, This guy can do things which will just blow you off ! All he asks in return is some appreciation <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .<br><br>  I cannot name a single guy in our whole batch, who is unaware of ranga's raccha ! That speaks a lot about his friendly nature. <br><br>   My last one year has been comfortable because of this guys company . Even though his room is 2 rooms away from mine, I always knock his door rather than my two neighbors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>   The thing which many people aren't aware about this guy is that is very very intelligent and loves to do puzzles and mathematical problems. He spends days/weeks on flash games which demand intelligence ! <br><br>    This is just first round dude ! Second round pe dekh <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br><br>Note to him: Dont stop smiling ! If you do, I am gonna fking kill you !</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Energy Bomb. DJ ranga is the easiest one to sketch  take a small ball and keep it keep it over a big ball and there you go .. DJ Ranga for you! Any event , any get together any wing<br>any damn place you can find this guy jumping and smiling. His instant shot to fame was<br>his act in Radio Mirchi 'idi chaala hot guru'! Recent performances include 'Masakali' in Felicity '09 and some breathtaking dance performances as a part of the crowd. Undoubtedly he is the biggest database of Hindi Songs and has a peculiar way of singing them... 'the Ranga Style'. I remember we were having a serious talk about how people change over the years and Ranga replies 'Chand Bhai I have changed a lot from first year but Nobody believes me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />'. This guy is irritated of being typecasted as a cutie<br>by the girls! I hope you find your 'ringa' soon. You rock Range... Cheers!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
