(well the only thing that flashes in his mind is coding)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kiranm.html>Kiran matam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kiran alias geek alias mabbu alias coding kirku alias kirku alias laughing kiran alias matamaiah<br>during the first days of our btech he never used to speak much so i thought he was a bacha but when we got a system, the way he seached for sex in google <img src=Smileys/77.gif />(the first search query he made in google) made me realize that he is a despo bacha<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.when i heard the tale of his and venkata mahesh's crazy things i realized that "veedu pedda muduru"..<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>This guy will always have a smiling face no matter how much u irritate him. I have seen him getting angry in ma 4 years for only 2-3 times(in those, 2 times was because of me<img src=Smileys/2.gif />).. if neone counters him he will just write a code in his mind to counter him and<br>if  (compilation error == NULL && executes properly)<br>        he will have a smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>else<br>        mabbu gadi la atu itu choostadu <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br><br>well i did learn some coding skills by spending time with him for 4 yrs...<br>If u ask ne q he will write a code to answer it<img src=Smileys/77.gif />(don.t try to write code for everything ra there are some things for which codes can't be written).. This geeky boy displays his geekiness in studies and at the same time displays his mabbutanam in nething which is not related to studies (very conflicting indeed<img src=Smileys/3.gif />).<br>he is the king of despos (second comes vasana chaitanya). no matter what he does, he always thinks of just 1 thing, "when will i get married"<img src=Smileys/41.gif />. he fumes on his tata for getting married so early and praises his avva for encouraging him to marry. he is a strong believer of "boys shud get married by 21" ( neeku edo sambandham vachindani talk vastundi ra nijamena)<img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br>  he is an ideal student. he doesn't forget his manners, wishes to his teachers no matter what he is doing..<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>  he is an ideal brother(anna) lecturing his brother on **xual awareness<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> (dude just make sure that no one else is in the house while doing such things, i wish i cud see ur face at that instant..)<br>  he is an ideal son..promised his father in 4th class that he will pursue his phd (after all he is a born geek)<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=svreddy.html>Vikas Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>i) I haven.t talked to this guy much in first year..<br>ii) in first  year I thought that he is a serious guy but after spending some time with him I realized that his body is over developed and his brain is underdeveloped<img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>Ex: once when he came running towards me (making sounds like a dinosaur running to catch its prey<img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and when I (including the entire OBH) noticed him, he said shit I wanted to surprise u. that was one hell of a hilarious situation<img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>iii) The way he walks, the way he talks all makes me laugh.<br>iv) he is a well organized uncle (sorry gentle boy<img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br><b><u>edaina oka paddhathi ga cheyyali</u></b><br>OMG I am also becoming more and more organized.<br>keeps his room clean.. takes good care of his bike.. will go from one corner of Hyderabad to other corner to buy a <b>pencil</b> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Wears different kinds of striped shirts and thinks that he is getting slim..(koncham slim avva ra vikki<img src=Smileys/10.gif />). OS freak (just celebrated installing a century OS.s) spends half of his time in browsing thru wikimapia and other half in reading reviews (he even reads reviews for <b>pencils</b>)<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> he is the first guy i have seen who sweats more than me<img src=Smileys/4.gif />..<br><br>we had an excellent time in these past 3 years like the trip we had, countless laughs we had during our lunch and dinner and the time we spent doing BC and I hope to have a lot more<br>such moments..<br>Always keeps a smile on his face. Keep up ur smile dude..He is one of my best friends..<br><br>vikas alias vikki alias B boy alias banda reddy riding on lanza and buying pencils summarizes him excellently..<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>PS1: take over azri dude..it needs an organized fella like u..<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>PS2: daily a <b>pencil</b> keeps the doctor away<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>PS3: hope bawarchi and prince stationary shops open a branch near ur azri office.<img src=Smileys/5.gif /><br>PS4: haripuri colony rks<br>PS5: nee pilla cheshtalu maneyyi ra vikki<br>PS6: pic adirindi ra..u look a punk with an aura<img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

If there was a ranking for despos then he will definitely get 2nd rank (sorry dude u r not da right guy for first rank and I think u know who gets the first rank<img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br>he is one of the talented guys of our batch and also kasi comparable to sana, no kidding (u have to agree dude after all u got more than 99 percentile<img src=Smileys/77.gif />)..will always be ready to support neone who opposes me and won.t miss a chance to torture me with his god given vocal gift <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> together with ram, another fella who supports neone to pull my legs (nannu antavu kaani neeku matram unity unda ra) they both deserve a job in train as part time singers(passengers must be lucky and I guess my luck got *ucked up<img src=Smileys/14.gif />)<br>dunno much abt his cricketing skills, heard that he is a good batsman (ofcourse next to sana<img src=Smileys/10.gif />).but I do know abt his skills at handling girls which are worth mentioning..once I have seen him flirting sry interacting with some 15 girls in front of main building.I need to learn from this fella about handling girls<img src=Smileys/77.gif />..<br>keeping all these things aside he is an excellent guy to spend time with. always ready to help other (thx for attending dc class on behalf of me<img src=Smileys/41.gif />)..we had an excellent time together in these past few years be it the nizamabad trip or eating biryanis together or irritating sana in felicity during the face paintings and many more.hoping to have more such moments in our friendship..<img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>PS1: aa juttu peekadam maneyyi ra<img src=Smileys/14.gif />..<br>PS2: veedu okka sari pette oil oka padi mandi ammailu padi rojulu pettukovachu<img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>PS3: gantalu gantalu ammayila ready avvaku ra..<img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>PS4: jokulu vesetappudu koncham alochinchuko lekapote shashank la tayaravutavu<img src=Smileys/24.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
