<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One more of the girls (I am bad at this!) with who I had issues, but it was very nice of her to come and sort out.<br><br>Shes your quintessential fodu girl.. Google + IIM calls, amazing work! Just that I felt you should have gone for the interviews.. Just for the heck of it!<br><br>Wish you all the very best in life! Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sahiti.html>Sahiti Polishetty</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sahiti, my favourite memories with her are Harsha and me leofying her together in the lab. It was awesome, had loads of fun while doing it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Shes a very cooperative girl, will help you out with whatever. I remember Harsha would often call her up for bailing him out during Felicity <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And she'd smilingly oblige. Shes a fodu at acads, her Google award proves that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Shes a very sensitive girl too.. Back in 1st year, I said things which I shoudn't have, and I am really sorry for that <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>May God bless! Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Co-networks TA and a networks fodu. The way Rawat sir would speak to you showed that- He truly adores you as a student <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Luckily you were there, cos Harshita, Kabeer, Kharkwal and I did not know an iota about networks <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Thanks for taking up all the tough questions!<br><br>Btw, hearty congratulations <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Hope you make it big in Ameeedika! <br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Anupama.. remember interacting with her during the human value sessions when we were in the same group. Back then, Harshita would keep talking about her. <br><br>Once incident, which I remember, she was coming back from workspace late in the night and I was going there. She had no clue that I could understand a fair bit of Telugu and asked someone (II dont remember who it was), "Where the hell is this guy going at this time?", and I replied back saying, "I know Telugu" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .Rofl incident that!<br><br>I think her poems are very sweet and show a lot of child like innocence in them.<br><br>Wish you all the very best in life! Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Early on in my B.tech (read 2nd and 3rd sems), Namrata was the girl with who I'd interact the most. We'd have marathon chat sessions, some of them lasting over four hours! Back then, we'd use Yahoo! messenger- and I loved some of the smilies both of us used. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Just like that! I must admit that I truly enjoyed talking to her. We'd speak about so many things - sports, gossip, girls, acads.. Ahh.. I loved it back then! That was also a time when I thought I'd found a good friend <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Unfortunately, we moved apart over time, so much so that we don't even have each other on our friend lists on the messenger! (Yahoo-> Google <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ) . I felt that you had some problems with me, blame me that I never tried to rectify them either. The issue with you was that you never allowed people to get close to you, you always maintained a distance. But I guess, I'll cherish some of the convivial memories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Coming to her, shes among the smartest females I've met. Shes got brains to go with her pretty face.. It was fun discussing issues with her. Some of her retorts were awesome.. Shes someone who can actually pull someone's legs with her wit. And yep, shes got real good command over the language. I love reading her pieces on her blog (which btw, has a very interesting url <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) . Needn't mention about her dancing skills.. Shes as graceful as one can get.<br><br>Namrata is a feminist to the extend of <i>nearly</i> being a chauvinist. I remember all those girls vs guys chats.. Especially with both of us pretty immature back then! But the admirable thing about her is that shes a smart and independent lady.<br><br>I remember one little incident, when I'd told her, "You've become a little fat". Cardinal sin! A week later, Spandana comes and tells me, "Why did you tell her that? She just doesnt eat now" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Wish you all the very best in life! May God bless.<br><br><b>Person she resembles: Oprah <br>Fav memory: The marathon 5 hour chat when she first got her laptop.<br>Message for her: Keep thinking and rocking! </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deeptizzzz....<br><br>I've seen some amazing transformations in her, all reflected from my interactions with her and her blog <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Earlier, she was this sweet little girl who thought too much about her relationships and could not handle the ups and downs. There were incidents in her life which changed it, and you can see it in her now.. The metro sexual babe next door! Swanky new hairstyle, stylish dresses and an altogether new confidence. She display's this dont-give-a-rat's-ass-to-losers around me attitude, which I must say is commendable. The way shes learnt and transformed herself is very nice to see.<br><br>But shes not just that, theres a lot more to her. Samvedana. It says a lot about her, doesn't it? I mean, you need to have a lot of will to give up a possible lucrative option for something you want to pursue for the society. And the best part of it all, shes been succesful in motivating people- each of them in their own ways. I still remember she urging us to join in, "Its not Jeevan Vidya.. " <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> For all the work done for it, hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I needn't mention about her acads here.. I remember all those days when we'd study in the reading room, and leofying her left, right and center. Shes also quite popular among her friends and accident prone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best in life, May God shower his choicest blessing on Sam and you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav memory: Leofying her in the reading room<br>Message for her: Never lose touch with yourself, and never change your basic self. </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=john.html>Samuel John</a></b>&nbsp;<br>John, haven't interacted much with him- but will remember him as this rebel kind of a guy. And of course, cricket in first year in front of the library- He was a very good player back then <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The other thing which I'd remember- the brutality with which he hits people on their birthdays in the OBH common garden <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . OMG, you gotta see that!<br><br>All the very best in life, mate!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>I'd also remember Vibhav for all the help he has rendered. He was unable to work for Felicity because of the vagaries of CVIT, but one little incident will stay etched in my memory. I was quite busy with Felicity, when he came up and asked me how things were. When he came to know that I had a lot of documents stored on my pc, he immediately offered me a remote pc to store all my stuff, have a backup. He offered to do all that for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Its also very sweet of him to lend me his laptop charger <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Other memories about him would be leofying him with various girls, his long hair, daroo parties and uske 'kaand' <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , he telling me his life story in the canteen <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> etc.<br><br>Wish you all the very best mate.. May you own the biggest graphics company in the world!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Did I hear Einstein? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: Club 8 party when he was royally out.<br>Message for him: Cribbing doesn't suit you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Baccha.. First impressions about this guy, a smiling nerd, not an assasin though <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . The impression stills holds good today, but its much more than a nerd today. You have to find a new term for it today!<br><br>This guy lives in the extremes.. He'd do anything to achieve something which he likes. We've seen that with research.. He is really into it, and does everything to achieve it. He is a slogger, a true ant. I don't need to state his achievements - its amazing to see a guy from some village (Begusarai) in Bihar come and conquer the world.. Rub shoulders with big names in the Vision industry. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Inspiring indeed!<br><br>He was like this in first year.. He knew what he wanted out of life, and one could see it with the way he put in effort into his acads. I'd visit Adi and his room just about every day, and he'd never cease to amaze or never disappoint - always into C/C++! In fact, I found him to be a bit of a snob back then, but perceptions changed after he started hanging out with us. He actually loves his friends, especially Chand and Pagare and loves spending time with them. Hes an advocate of the group unity, always talks about we eating together at the mess table. Especially given that he doesn't  too much bakar in the wings. Its sometimes a little sad that he can't get too much time with us, but then he's chosen his priorities in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Vibhav also has a fair bit of knowledge about things around him, it was fun discussing politics and cricket with him. However, I feel that he shoudn't be cribbing about stuff in college without actually getting up and doing something.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>Coming to our relationship, we were never great friends. But over the years, I've started to develop respect for him as a person, something which is the bedrock of all relationships. I told the same to him in one of our daroo sessions. Though we've never been that close, the respect for you will be there mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Other things about him- hes Mr. blank, plays good tt but has never been a regular, is very cute and a lot of senior girls loved him during ragging <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , enjoys working out, loves his pals.<br><br>May God bless and give you the best in life!<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Fez from That 70s show<br>Fav memory: The cock incident in Alleygator <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Message for him: Dude, be more confident about yourself <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Himank and I were discussing the other day as to how everyone in the batch could be classified as an 'item'. And Raman has to take the cake for that! You could nearly make a comic strip on Raman, a volume of which should be titled, "Raman and Pappu". <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I started interacting with Raman when the group formed, I remember that he lived in cellar in a very clean room. However, I found him (still so) an irritating guy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He would pass silly little comments which'd make you go "grrr...." . However, the thing about Raman is that he is very pure at heart. He might say off the cuff remarks when the situation doesnt demand so, but his intentions are always right <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He thinks good for the people he likes, and there are quite a lot of such guys <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Of course, with those remarks he manages to shift the focus of "leofying" on himself, just like how I'd do earlier. But people, especially Pappu, are often the victim of his sense of humour. Dude, remember that conversation about the filmfare awards? <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Poor Pappu.. Then there are those acts of his.. The Orissa case with Vibhav has become.. well, legendary! What a situation man <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We also pull his leg about him passing out only in 2020.. The entire plan with wife and kids is ready <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Jokes apart, Raman has become quite serious towards his acads these days, something which he was not in the first two years. I guess pursuing an MS by research under Jaws does that to you.. Plus the leofying we did seems to have done the trick. You can now find him in the lab or room, coding away to glory!<br><br>Of course, all the above is when he is not sleeping. He simply loves it, would not be wrong to compare him with Kumbhakaran. There was this joke of Raman dreaming about him sleeping, and then the same thing happening in recursion.. What would happen if the alarm rings.. Which Raman would get up? <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vivekprakash.html>Vivek Prakash</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Vivek Prakash, one of the most intelligent guys in the batch. I remember how he used to tell us that he knew JAVA, C#, Pearl, Python and what not back in the first year itself. Even when it came to the programming assignments, he'd be the first one to get done with them. He is quite hard working too when it comes to his acads; little wonder that he has a job in Microsoft.<br><br>A certain incident made him infamous though <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the best!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Rama Reddy put in a lot of work for the media department in Felicity '08. He was hand picked by Harsha, and really lived up to his trust. Bringing media people, handling them.. It was all done quite well. <br><br>Hes got a nice sense of humour, and is in general, a jolly kind of a person. <br><br>All the very best in life, mate!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvcreddy.html>Vinay Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When I think of Vinay, the short smiling face always comes to my mind. Never the tough and strong image which Chand talks about <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He is very soft spoken, and is always ready to lend a helping hand. Has a very good sense of humour too, have seen him leofying some of his wingmates <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>All the very best!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Anthwal and I have never been the best of friends nor will we ever be. I never liked the way he handled all of the ragging cases. He probably doesn't like any of the netagiri I do. But I genuinely admire him for a few things. One, he has principles in life and acts in accordance to them. Two, he is your most talented chap in every sphere, to me, he is the real Mr.Felicity '06. And three, I like his cricket and really enjoyed all the support he extended to me.<br><br>May God bless!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vrktavva.html>Tavva Rajesh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Hes got to be one of the best dancers in the college.. Some of his moves are amazing, wonder how he manages them! Cannot forget his dances in first year freshers and this year's Felicity!<br><br>Hes not that very social guy any more, it was different in the first year. He was quite active and interacted with everyone around him. And always had a smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>All the very best in life!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=saket.html>Saket Kumar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If I had to count three weirdos in the batch, Saket's name will be right up there. He is always lost in his own world; watching sitcoms and chatting with arbit foreigners without as much as a rat's ass to the rest of the world. I wonder whether he ever bothers about his life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>His room was the play practise adda for Aakash house in the first year. Back then, he was hilarious as the yoga master <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We used to hang out a lot in my wing, courtesy Khatri and Saurabh. Poor Ganja (One of the three in the batch) was always the guy getting leofied <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I still wonder of thats one of the reasons why he lives along in the ground floor now!<br><br>All the very best in life!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Has to be all the play practices in your room. </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vvchaitanya.html>V.V.Chaitanya Krishna</a></b>&nbsp;<br>VV.. One of the campagning guys during Felicity '08. I first started interacting with him only during the Sunday Carnival last year. He put in a good amount of effort, and it was fun working with him. Hes pretty active elsewhere too, and I hope we have a great batch trip this time around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Or rather, I'm sure we will <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Just open his orkut profile and you'll find a lot of girls in there. Looks like he is quite popular among the fairer sex <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .<br><br>All the best in life buddy, Have a nice time at Verizon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>He likes being surrounded by friends, enjoys their company. However, he hardly ever opens up except with his very close friends. Personally, I've never been close to him.<br><br>And yeah.. Who can forget his legendary voice? He has to be the loudest in the batch, I remember that occasion when both of us screamed out from the terrace and Pagare messaged back immediately <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . It was fun, wasn't it?  Hes famous for doing that regularly in his wing!<br><br>I often have a feeling that he is stuck in his own utopian world, with a lot of art and girls <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Most of the times, dreamy is his state of mind. Once again, its all artistic instincts. I can so very well imagine him living only with his girl in an island- painting away to glory! But he, like all of us, also likes attention, a pointer comes from all the "aksay" like acts he does <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Other memories with him include leofying him (SNS), screaming together <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> , begging of him to click my pics- only to be denied every time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , discussing all the places where he's lived, roomie discussions <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..<br><br>Couple of more things which I <i>truly</i> appreciate about him- his resilience and his ability to keep his cool under pressure.<br><br>Wish you all the very best in life!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Akshay Kumar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: Screaming together from the rooftop.<br>Message for him: Find you calling in life, you are not someone who should go with the flow. </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Shrikant bhai, another of my cellar and group mates <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Like many others, our story started with the marathon outing in the first year. He was Shashank's roomie, and I remember studying together for a few exams back then. This asshole was(is) a kaamchor, would never work for his subjects. That has long been the case, and here I'd make a mention about his passions. He is a very passionate person, drowns himself completely in the thing hes doing, oblivious to the surroundings around him. It was the guitar earlier, and is photography now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He takes so many photos from such weird angles, you have to look at them! I remember Himank, Vipul and I were leofying him for this left, right and center once <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We took pics of lots of things and told him that he a was no better than us <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Poor chap!<br><br>The fact about photographs and the work he put in for Kalakshetra (more about that later) makes me feel that he is an artist by heart- loves to appreciate and be involved in art. He cannot live without the artistic fodder. Here I'd like to suggest him that he should find a true passion which you want to pursue throughout your life. If you know that the technical line is not your calling and something else is, you've got to listen to your heart. <br><br>Now about Kalakshetra. Ganja put in some brilliant work for Kalakshetra '08; frankly, he took upon the kind of responsibility which I did not expect him to. He would run around buying stuff, arranging things, coordinating with people- and did it all wonderfully well. It showed the things he could achieve with dedication.<br><br>(continued..)<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=srpchaitanya.html>Phani Chaitanya</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Fuck you man! Just remove the Liverpool tee from your DP <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . You suckers do not win anything and keep talking about it being the best club and all <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Everytime I see him, he has a smile and "Ent ra" ready. He has a rough voice, but the smile on his face is a constant. Fuck Gerrard, but I am happy that he is Rahul Dravid fan. Hes among the best man, no doubting that. <br><br>A very hardworking and "kasi" kind of a guy, especially in NLP. Have fun in Checktronix man, and dont forget me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May God bless.<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=psreddy.html>P Srinivasa Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It was the day of the NVidia interview. I was getting ready for it, when Samrat told me that Srinivas deserved to be there more than anyone else. Even after the interview, Srinivas came and asked me about the interview. He told me that the role they were offering matched his profile. It was unfortunate that neither of us could make it :sigh: .<br><br>Another incident which happened a week back in Club 8. After a more than the prescribed amount of alcohol in blood, I was merrily strolling around the pub, when I found this chap. Excited about finding another group from IIIT in the pub, I hugged him and asked him to take me to the rest of their group <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I'll always remember whatever happened sometime after that - the drunken brawl <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>From what I know of him, hes a soft spoken and hard working person.<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: GAG blasting you in one of the interview venues and me laughing my ass off <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>First image of Ninja- as the guy who broke down while being ragged by seniors. We were all very surprised back then, but you have to see him and his background to see the incident in perspective. He comes from a small town and has been a soft spoken kind of a guy. It was good that he put the incident behind him and worked towards his goal. He is very good at his acads, best in ECE after Khurana.<br><br>His work in running Yuktahaar has been exemplary. I raise a toast to him for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . We've had differences, especially over the coordinator thingy, but who does not have differences? I hope we can put them behind us.<br><br>May God bless!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gnpkumar.html>Nagarjuna Pavan Kumar G</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nagarjuna, a dynamic and proactive person whos always ready for an argument/discussion. I remember all those matches which we watched together in the TV room, and how you'd keep giving gyaan to everyone on the players, match conditions, commentators and what not <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Shows his passion for cricket. <br><br>Nagarjuna is a good basketball player, a core member of his house and batch teams. He also worked quite hard for CAT, I hope he'll make it to the IIM of his choice <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May God bless!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I'll remember Dandu as my sweet neighbour in class who always had a smile on. We shared a PC in workspace. While Bajaj and I were just interested in browsing and programming, Dandu kept playing around with and changing the configurations and Linux versions of the PC- so much so, that we'd often had to work on another PC!! He was never sincere with his assignments, did it all in the last minute- but did it quite well. Hence I was surprised when he did not get placed for so much time.<br><br>By virtue of being class neighbours, we have had a lot of interactions, and I've found him to be a very laid back person. Hes quite friendly though, and is always the victim of leg pulling in his gang <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=dhingra.html>Hemant Dhingra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Dhingra was among the first people I interacted with in IIIT, in virtue of being his wing mate. The first time I meet him, he tells me about all is exploits in badminton, tt and athletics. I though, jarur koi stud banda hoga. Back then, we used to hang out a lot together in Khatri's room. The stud waala image slowly faded away because of the amount he was leofied <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But well, hes definitely among the best TT and badminton players we have. He's won quite a few laurels in this field. <br><br>He is always pissed off about his work, and I hope he gets his MS degree soon. Fir IIM-A join kar lena <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . These days, he has a stud-waala bike <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , and thanks for all those times when you've given us your helmet. <br><br>May God bless!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sankhlecha.html>Bharat Sankhlecha</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sankhleca chotu. He was my neighbour for a year, and is a very sweet person.

<b>For <a href=mahaveer.html>Veer Deora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mahaveer bhai.. Over the past few years, we've had a decent level of friendship except for one incident, which changed it all. <br><br>Cricket has been the unifying factor for us over the past few years. I have played under many captains in IIIT, but I have no hesitation in calling him one of the best captains I've played under. He is so proactive with his decision making and so encouraging for the lesser players (which I was). I still remember the kind of support and encouragement he gave me in second year, and included me in the batch team <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . It was my bad that I screwed up the chance back then. He has one of the sharpest sporting brains on his shoulders and has always been one of the core members of the team. Even in a sport like volleyball, something which he'd not played much, he transformed his inexperienced team into a winning one.<br><br>It is so unfortunate that our skirmish also took place thanks to cricket. Now thats wrong on my part- blaming cricket, I think it was ego which came in between the relationship. But well, things got better, and we had a talk in the daroo treat from juniors. And I hope we're on decent terms now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Apart from these, I'll remember Veer for his post on IIIT girls (It was hilarious <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ), the mentor that he has been for UG2K7, his amazing sense of humour, our common levels of desperation <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , Marwari, ragging, the good work he put in for Felicity, the ideas and plans he has for the college.. He is one person who <i>always</i> has my respect for following his heart and principles. What I dont like about him is the moody nature and the kind of ego.<br><br>Wish you all the very best in life mate! May God bless! Really hope that we do stay in touch.<br><br><b>Fav memory: You encouraging me during practice sessions.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Haan bhai Somani. Everyone knows hes the best coder, a fodu champion etc etc. Won't dwell much into that. What I'll narrate is a small incident.<br><br>It was the first day of programming lab, and Somani was sitting besides me. Now on that day, the PCs were not working and the TAs were trying to work a way around it. Somani was doing something frantically with his PC. When I asked him about it, he said, "Abe agar sab ka nahi chal raha to thik hai, lekin sirf hum logon ka nahi chal raha to chutiyapa ho jaayega. Mein kuch miss nahi karna chahta hoon." Bhai, hats off for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . Recently, in Felicity '09, Pagare and I went to participate in Quick and the dead. We entered tha lab, saw Somani sitting there and immediately turned back. Well, thats Somani for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I admire him for the amount of dedication and hard work he puts in to whatever he does. He loses sleep, spends all his time in the lab but makes sure that his objective is achieved.

<b>For <a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Richeek is a man of strong values, likes and dislikes. I remember how he'd written a mail to us opposing the rock show- as he considered it an event of sleaze and booze. Well dude, let me tell you thats not true, rock is a very interesting and meaningful type of music, which, due to its nature has a lot of takers among the youth <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Richeek has always been very good in his acads. He also cracked the GRE, and his knowledge about MS is pretty good. This resulted in his taking the seminar for the juniors for MS and GRE. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I'll also remember the smile and wave with which you greet me whenever we meet.<br><br>May God bless you.<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Nauty saab.. A very silent and shy kind of a person. He likes to stay within himself, and takes a lot of time to open up. Hes also very mannered and a humble chap.. comes with his basic nature I guess <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I enjoy his sketches a lot, they have a lot of heart in them. I think he should keep pursuing this talent of his.<br><br>We discuss Virender Sehwag a lot on the mess table.. Hes a hard core fan of his. Cannot hear a word against the Nawab of Najafgarh! We've had so many discussions, but finally Nauty has had his way. Sehwag is back to the form of old <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I also remember placements time.. I told him that you get placed in the 5th company which interviews you.. And lo! It proved right for him too. You owe me one for that dude!<br><br>All in all, a very nice person and a good friend.<br><br><b>Fav memory: Discussing Sehwag <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 4 </b></i><br><br>Needless to mention, he got back to his lazy ways after getting placed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He was a heavy boozer earlier, but consciously stays within his limits these days. You could get anything out of him earlier, but these days during booze sessions, he hardly ever tells anything about himself. Except the recent session, when he narrated his entire story <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And didn't we enjoy it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Other memories with him include Graphics course and being partners; work for Felicity; walk during the scuffle time (When I tried convincing him to apologize); listening to his amazingly unbelievable stories (which he claims are true <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ); leofying him during the recent cricket match; leofying him for the way he runs, especially during BB matches <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ; promising to work out together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ; listening to BB boys (He is bbb freak) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ; rusticating him for lack of personal cleanliness (He doesnt have bath for days, wears the same shirt for days- both for working out and normally.. yuck!); trying to wake him up (You have to have a burning iron rod for that!); encouraging him to blog (He is a terrific writer.. Has a way with words) etc.<br><br>He is a thinker, and an independent person. He is a Delhitie, but a very different one at that. He has principles and will always stand by them, some of them are unflappable. And I really appreciate him for that. <br><br>I'll miss PK and all his vagaries. All the very best in life mate!

<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 3 </b></i><br><br>Third year was when I saw another aspect of his. I decided to take the plunge for Felicity, and expected a lot from my group. And I was surprised to see that apart from Chand and Pagare, he was the one who really took an amazing amount of responsibility upon him. He had so much passion for sponsorships, I was amazed. If I had to count 10 people who worked the most for Felicity '08, he'd be one of them. He did things by taking initiative, remember collecting names of non-IT companies? Even during the three days, he handled singing when somebody else could not do it. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>The second time I saw him putting that kind of effort was for Placements. I think he started preparing right from the start of the seventh semester - and inspired a whole lot of people around him. That was also when he got the name 'Joshi' (from Josh) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But well, he does not like it when we use that name.. Its fun leofying him though <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Come the first day of placements, and he was among the most frustrated souls. Day two was very important. We gave the Amazon and Adobe tests and were coming back when the Amazon written results came. Strike three. He was as shattered as one could get. On the way back to the mess, I tried consoling him, but couldn't do so, given my own state of mind. And that was when I got the good news that both of us had cleared the Adobe written. He was delighted when I gave him the news. We spent the next few hours together, and he gave some amazing interviews. I remember, in each of my interviews, the interviewers asked me about Prashant. He was a certainty; and we were the two guys remaining at the end of all the rounds. My fate that they just took one person, but I was very happy for him that day <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . What better than Prashasti and he getting placed in the same company! Later, he helped me a lot with C++ concepts, and thanks for all that <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2 </b></i><br><br>We started hanging out together, we had a lot of night outs and outings in the second sem. I'll probably call the best sem among the eighth we've had- it was so much fun. Did I mention that hes the most fodu coder I've seen. His knowledge of C++ is deep, we actually had the course back in class twelve. I remember frequently asking him for Sumita Arora to read C++ from it. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Second year. I decided to move to cellar, as that was where most of my friends lived. PK agreed to be my roomie, and there started a new saga. We started talking a lot to each other, and became good friends. However, I've always (till date) had this feeling that PK has never been very close to me- he shares till a certain level, but not beyond that. I guess thats because he has other very close people around him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Nevertheless, we used to chat a lot. Hes always had an irregular schedule- generally sleep during the day and stay awake in the night. I was more of a lark and he the owl. So sometimes, it would be days before we got to interact to each other- but that was never a deterrent; when we spoke, we did it as if we were continuing yesterday's conversation <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . We spoke about a lot of things- careers, girls, computer science, graphics, real estate etc <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He opened up to me (till a certain level) and so did I; we had a great time together. Both of us were filthy, and hence there was no problem of keeping the room neat <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Our room back then was among the dirties rooms one could possibly live in <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But we didn't give it a rat's ass!<br><br>Let me mention here that PK is one of the laziest yet the most active guy. He'd sleep for hours and hours together, get up have a few packets of chips and biscuits and get back to sleep! Ahhh chips.. Well, he absolutely dotes on food. There are three passions in his life- food, sitcoms and the third one is obvious <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . Just put him in a room with food and sitcoms- and he needs nothing else. Given a chance, he'll not come out for days <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1 </b></i><br><br>PK, so many memories associated with this good friend of mine. Bitter, sweet- they've all been there. <br><br>Flashback to July 2005. We'd all just come in; that was also the time when the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series had released. Now I tried getting hold of the book, but to no avail. That was when this chap told me that he was going to read the e-version of the book. Now those were the days when the workspace PCs would always be occupied, and hence we'd use the library PCs. I went to the library and found this asshole reading the book on the library PC. I got pissed at this, especially given that I had some important work and he refused to budge for a long time :X .<br><br>For such incidents and another issue, I abhorred him back then. I found him an irritating bastard, who hung out with the other assholes like Himank, Vipul etc. I am amazed to look back at those moments now and realize that these are my closest chums today <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Never judge a book by its cover - how true.<br><br>Slowly, driven by a common passion for Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl, we started bonding. The next incident was his birthday. In the morning, I wished him and asked him for a treat, which he promised. But this fucker - the ass that he was never treated me- in spited of treating some of his other friends. That was when I realized that we could never be close pals, I even confronted him regarding this. <br><br>That issue of him giving importance only to a few people and having a "fuck them all" attitude towards the others led to THE fight in the group back in first year. That was after TB was formed, and PK and I found ourselves in the same set of people. That was a sad incident, and I remember everyone sitting in one of the rooms and crying about it. (I'd actually never imagined that friendship could get so emotional). I think that incident changed PK a lot. That day, he came and spoke to me, and we had a real heart to heart to talk. I think thats the time when we <i>actually</i> became friends.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kiranm.html>Kiran matam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kiran was my roomie in my first year. And I have no complaints with that, he was a very cooperative roomie. They call him, "Laughing Kiran", and the name could not be more apt. You would never see him fighting with anyone- If we had any issues, we'd always settle it amicably. In fact, hes so adjusting that we hardly had any issues. One memory which I have is after the DLD grades came out. As soon as he came to the room, he congratulated me heartily and praised me. That was because I had managed an 'A'. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He is a hardworking and dedicated guy. He also plays decent cricket, he did come for the house practise sessions in the first year, but never after that.<br><br>Wish you all the best in life!<br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kishorepudi.html>Kishore Pudi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Pudi baba!<br><br>I dont know why he is called 'skam pudi', etc.. I feel that he is a person of strong values. I remember that once when we were making a racket in one of the classes, Pudi came up to and blasted me! I felt a littl sad that day, and he taught me a lesson that day!<br><br>My co Vizag mate, we worked together in Felicity '08. He did some very good work in hardware, and I remember the amount we used to bug him for print outs <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But he'd always oblige with a smile. That smile is always there when he sees me. <br><br>Hes also a terrific goalkey, something which I didn't believe he could do till I saw him do it. One match, where he jumped to make a terrific save will remain etched in my memory. Super save that!<br><br>All the best in life, mate!<br><br><b> Fav memory: Felicity '08 </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=dharmeet.html>Dharmeet Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the most religious guys I've ever seen, Dharmeet is a one of his kind person. He was religious in his first year, and that kept increasing as the time worn by. These days, especially from his questions in the Indic classes, you can see that he tried a lot to understand what Indian religion has got to teach to us, and is trying to see in the context of his life. I'm sure some of the amazing calm he has is courtesy The Guru Granth Sahib <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>He has some very good habits, early to bed and very early to rise; good food habits; good mannerisms.. All of these are worth emulating. He is interesting company, but cracks way too many fattas, and starts laughing- something which forces you to laugh, but silently curse him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .His fridge was very famous in cellar for having a never ending supply of stuff <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>All the best in life!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Him teaching Indic, thanks for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinav_mehta.html>Abhinav Mehta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Himank has spoken about how we miss the Golu of the old. I couldn't agree more with him.<br><br>In our first year, Golu was this cheerful, chirpy little chap who always had something about him which made you laugh. All the same, he was a very magnetic personality, something which showed when he reached the final round of Mr. Fresher 2005. We did the Aakash skit together, and his bubbly spirit brought the play alive. You should have seen him dance, it was super fun, it was like Lakshmipaty Balaji batting in Pakistan.. Everyone loved it! <br><br>Then came Jeevan Vidya towards the end of the first semester- a shivir which we did together. Right from day one, Golu seemed to be intrigued by what Ganeshji had to say. He kept asking a lot of questions, something which we found amusing as we'd thought that he was doing it for the fun of it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We enjoyed it and played along, by encouraging him to 'ask more doubts'. But nah, apparently the shivir truly affected him like nothing else did. I could see that when Aniket and I wrote the article on JV for the college mag - his interview was the most interesting. He spoke about how certain things affected him and brought about some kind of a change in him.<br><br>Now, Golu always smiles when he sees us, but hes not the same bubbly chap anymore. He is generally lost deep in his thoughts, and is probably more focused. <br><br>I long for those first year days. You might have changed from Golu to Mehta, but your memory with me will be that of Golu.<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Your dance during the practice sessions for Aakash.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman Randeep. Early images of him were of this chap who was desperate to go home at every given opportunity. Seriously, sometimes I cannot fathom this obsession, even after staying away for so much time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Given such an image and his MS PPO, I would have imagined that he'll be the last person to work for batch placements.<br><br>But how wrong was he to prove me! Adi and he were at the forefront of it all, and he did some fantastic work. He is also known to have a queer relationship with GAG- always ready to take him on, and here's one of our conversations:<br><br>(GAG, Adi, Sambhav, Banga and me at the scene)<br><br>GAG: Blah Blah..<br>Adi, Sambhav, Me: No sir, its not like that..<br>GAG: No gentleman., blah blah..<br>Adi, Sambhav, Me: (Wanted to get out of the place soon.)

<b>For <a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Adi and I worked together for the finances of Felicity '08 (along with Harsha, Rishi and Rohit). Now he was silently efficient and went about doing his job without any fuss. We did have our share of issues though, it was never a bed of roses. I guess finance is like that - the guys handling it have got to be a little strict. And thats where Harsha and I often failed to understand him. <br><br>Adi did some good work the next year also. Even before that, I remember him as the guy who handled all the finances for stalls. Some of my fav memories with him are the marathon meeting with Swati M'am and Chhaya, the discussions when Felicity '08's coffers were empty, the discussions after the Indian Ocean fiasco- the way he handled it etc. Cheers to all those memories mate!<br><br>Hope you get out of this place and into a money minting machine soon enough!

He is not that aggressive foul-mouthed chap, if anything hes right on the other pole. Soft spoken and well mannered, he always asks good things about you when you meet. He has got very good knowledge in a lot of spheres, especially economics and technology, where he is fodu. I guess hes well suited to do an MBA or CFA, I'm sure he'll make it to one of the top B-schools.<br><br>It was quite surprising that he could not get placed earlier, especially given his level of competence.

July 2005, when he was in my wing. I'd always find him studying in the room or library, and I'd think, "Wow.. Amazing effort this chap puts in". Well fast forward to March 2009, and I was amazed, yet again, to see the dedication for the Economics course. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We were CAT buddies, and had quite a few discussions together. He, like Chethan always put in a good amount of effort into cracking the exam. Though he could not crack it this time around, I'm sure he'll do it sooner rather than later. He had an IIFT call, and cracked it <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . <br><br>He is also good for discussing stuff, dissects things logically and discusses points by merit.

<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>I haven't interacted much with Aakash, but of whatever little, it has been very cordial. In fact, hes that time of a guy- never gets agitated and is quite friendly. My first memories with him date back to the time when we were being ragged by the D-gang. In misery, we stuck it out <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . After that, I remember discussing Jaws' assignments in the workspace, and most of the times, he had an elegant solution ready for the problem in question. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> His competency came to fore recently, during placements. We got interviewed for a lot of companies together, including Adobe, Citrix, Ivy. I was very happy when he finally got placed <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I also remember doing Jeevan Vidya together. Kapil, he and I interacted a lot back then - it was a bit of a relief from some of those sessions. Overall, hes a guy with friendly demeanour and a positive outlook.<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b> Fav memory: Jeevan Viday </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Maglu.. My favourite memories of him have come on the dining table. Everyday, Himank and I would be on the lookout for Maglu. As soon as he comes, we start leofying him about his support for Australia.. How he .. you know what.. to Symonds and Ponting <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . It is amazing to see that he always retorts back, but all with a smile. He is still that hard core fan, though Himank and I have somewhat dented his confidence about the Kangaroos.<br><br>Apart from that, hes a sweet little chap with a hilarious way of talking <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . The way he narrates things is awesome. He is also very dedicated to his work, I'm sure he'll get his MS degree soon. And yeah.. Hes crazy after Miss. X, now I'm sure everyone knows about it and his rendezvous in the workspace <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: He praising me in first year, thanks for it man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Message for him: Why the obsession with the Aussies <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sagrawal.html>Shashank Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Shashank and I were very good friends in the first year. We'd spend a lot of our time together, both as a part of Trailblazers and without it. He is a brilliant and intelligent student, something which was evident in those days too. I remember studying together for some exam.. Don't know which one it was. We had a bit of the competitive spirit, but he came ahead with 9.54 in the first sem, 0.27 more than mine <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Over time, we moved away because of issues and skirmishes. But I'll cherish certain memories, best among them the Dussera outing which we planned and implemented. It was fun to see him dancing and singing that day. He had that josh about it back then, there was always a spring in his step. Hes really mellowed down when you look at him now. I hope there is still that passion and desire to do well in your life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>Wish you all the best for your MS. Good to see you doing your thing.<br><br><b>Fav memory: Leofying him about 'char' <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Message for him: Do not go into your shell.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankits.html>Ankit Saraswat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If there is one person who I respect the most for sheer intelligence, it has to be him. I've heard stories about him (mostly from Khatri), and it is amazing listening to the things he does. I mean missing the MS interview just for gaming.. Sheer passion for it!<br><br>I've not interacted much with him, but of whatever little, he has left an impression. In first year, I remember him coming to the workspace at 8 PM, 4 hours before Jaw's assigment deadline. He came, wrote a few lines, compiled, uploaded and went away. All in two freakin hours! And the rest of us would not have spent less than ten times that. He made us look like morons of the first order!<br><br>I'll also remember the interactions in fourth year in his wing, he is another of those football freaks. Besides, he has a good knowledge base in varied fields, and hence is good to discuss stuff with <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I'm sure that once you have a passion for life, there is absolutely <i>nothing</i> which can stop you. <br><br><b>Fav memory: The daroo kaand last year.<br>Message for him: Hume mat bhulna <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

For 100% entertainment and a laugh marathon, just open the yearbook and read the testimonials written by Dwivedi bhai. They're awe.. wait for it.. fucking some! In fact, even on the mess table and others' orkut profiles, he is (in?)famous for his smart mouth remarks! <br><br>In his early days, he was famous for his guitar sessions (with Aniket) and an active music head. He loves playing instruments, and has been very active in all the cultural events in the campus. (He is a part of the college rock band too) Then you have basketball, hes one of the fodu players in the batch. Add to it his acads and the spirit of entrepreneurship and you have one of the best but an inconspicuous all rounder. The important thing in each of these aspects is that he has learnt all of them from scratch only after coming to college. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Its amazing that a guy from Rewa could come in as an underdog and make it big till this stage! But nothing stopping you Atul, this underdog should certainly bite! And bite big.

<b>For <a href=yvsandeep.html>Sandeep Y V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Day 1 of placements. Sitting in the mess, everyone had this tense look on their faces. People were excited, discussing the written papers of Microsoft and DE Shaw- after all, they were the best companies around. When the results came, most of the names were the usual suspects, but you had one surprise name - in both the lists. We were all pretty surprised, and till then, were in the dark about his 'kasiness'!<br><br>However, come to think of it, I think he put in a lot of effort towards the same. Even during the CAT days, he tried to balance both mocks and placement preps. Little wonder, that he cracked both of them! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>YV is a very soft spoken person, who never says no when I ask him for his helmet <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I've enjoyed interacting with him, discussing all our strategies for CAT preparations. <br><br>I hope you make it to IIM-A next year <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=samish.html>Samish Chandra Kolli</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I came to know of Samish through my friend Sudha (who happens to be his cousin). I met him during the AIEEE counseling (I think) and remember him as a very shy guy. He hardly even spoke to Sudha, and I found that surprising, given that they were cousins of the same age <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>After that, we'd speak sometime to each other, courtesy my time spent in Adi's room. He is this intelligent chap, with a fodu eamcet rank and good acads. He was always a silent chap, but gave help when asked for it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Over the years, I'll also remember him as this hard core gamer!<br><br>Wish you all the best in life!<br><br><b>Fav memory: BC in first floor.<br>Message for him: Why so shy? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Vatasal, my partner in the EPP presentation last time around. I don't know why he still blames me for speaking for too little time during the presentation. I spoke for more than 15 minutes, plus there was a video at the end of it all <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But mate, thanks a lot for doing a major part of the work- being a little tough for me in that semester <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Vatasal is very talented, especially when it comes to sketching. He is a nice, soft spoken and well mannered chap. Hes got decent acads, and a very well toned body <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He was pretty active for Aakash in the first year, I remember the enthusiasm he showed for the Freshers skit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . However, hes faded over time, and hasn't even put his sketching skills to good use. I loved it when he started designing tees, he did a very good job of it. I think he often has demons about himself and a lot of self-doubts creep in.<br><br>I've enjoyed those BC sessions in the first year (He was my floor mate) and during the EPP course.

<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Alok, as Sachin would say, is one of the most admirable guys in the batch. You can <i>never</i> see Alok agitated over anything. Be it the amount of leofying he is subject to or the help he has to render his friends, he always takes it all with a smile. It is amazing how he can manage the smile even in the worst of situations. <br><br>He is the embodiment of sincerity and hard work, I was a witness to it being his neighbour in cellar. 4th year, final semester, and he is still all ears in the Indic class. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . I remember that he'd never refuse to teach any subject when we asked him to do so. Or for that matter, never refuse help to anyone in need. He is a very soft person at heart, and can never think of hurting anyone; which is so unlike the image we have for Biharis <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Bhai, aakhir Laloo ke desh mein bhi hire paida hote hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>It is fun listening to his fattes and leofying him. He, like three other guys has been regularly linked to Miss. X, Alok admitting his liking for her <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . Well, I remember one of those SE classes when he was continuously being leofied. <br><br>All in all, a wonderfully respectable person.

Can it get more apt?<br><br>In the initial days of Felicity '08, our mood and optimism about the fest would often depend on Bhargava's mood. Yes, he was <i>that</i> crucial to the working of he fest. Right from the start till the very end, he was there as a major figure. A lot of our discussions would take place in his room.<br><br>Everyone knows that hes the best designer around. Everyone knows that the way he handled the Felicity video was brilliant. Everyone knows that he came up with some super fodu designs for the posters and the website. Every time we needed something to be designed, Bhargava was there. This put a lot of extra burden on him, but he took on the responsibilities <i>most</i> of the times. Of course, it was natural that with such burden, there were times he would get irritated. But he took it all with his typical smile. And did a super job of the video!<br><br>In more ways than one, I think Felicity '08 changed him! He was no more shy, could see how it was working under so much pressure and expectations. While pushing you, sorry if I ever crossed my brief, mate!

<b>For <a href=vvelagapuri.html>Vamshi Velagapuri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The five foot guy who came to our rescue. If Felicity '08 owes one person, it has to be him. He gave so much to the fest, that we feel dwarfed when I look at his contribution. <br><br>We planned to complete the website by September, but close to nothing had been done by then. In October, we were all in a panic mode, as there was no one left to work for the website. I felt terrible, especially as I remembered the number of people who had turned up for the initial meetings.<br><br>That was when Vamshi entered the scene. Totally raw and down to earth, he single handedly handled the website from then on. He had a lot of commitments if his own- He was not your vellah guy, he had a lot of academic constraints. But he gave all his time, devoted his holidays, spent all his nights in the lap to rescue us from the situation. Absolutely amazing dedication. I just shudder to think what would have happened otherwise. For all your work, <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>He is normally a very soft spoken person, with his funny accent.

<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>On the first day of college, we had a professor's (I think Jawahar) class. Jaws asked the class for volunteers for a make shift CR, for the elections had not been held back then. For all everyone may speak, there was just one hand which went up.. Ojasvi Rajpal. For most of us, this was the first introduction to this chap. Flash forward to an year later when he told us, "I stepped back, or Daddu was a goner". <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> But yes, he did enjoy a lot of popularity in the batch back then <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>For reasons best known to him, hes never been active from that time on. I guess priorities change in life, and yes, his focus was more on acads later on. Point proved by the Microsoft PPO. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . But yes, I still crave to see a retake of the Vayu act on freshers <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . How fast have those days passed! :sigh:<br><br>I think he is still a bit of a kid lost in his own dreamy world <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Enjoyed all the BC with him in cellar.<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: When he became the CR.<br>Message for him: Speak clearly <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>We have had our share of differences though. In not just one issue, but many of them. For example, I don't like certain things about what he does, things like the amount he exaggerates, the way he sometimes thinks unidimensionally etc. But credit that both of us could put aside those differences and work together. Felicity is a case in point. In spite of the differences, he lent me immense support during the entire festival. I still remember the day when he thought that work for Felicity needed to be speeded up, and came up and told me how to go about doing it. He put in work like only he could have - convincing companies to shell out cash. His suggestions and support during the entire festival were invaluable <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> .<br><br>In spite of the screw ups, I enjoyed working under him for the batch trip. Though I guess that experience left him disappointed and he did not invite me for this time's batch trip organization <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He also put in commendable work for our placements, thanks for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>Did I also mention his acting and direction talents? I think when it comes to skit play, Anthwal, Chand and he are the best around. His cheesy sense of humour and sarcasm are quite enjoyable. Just wonder why he disappeared in the cultural field after the first year!<br><br>Other memories with him include he presenting me with a perfume bottle, CAT and career discussions, 3rd night of Felicity, SCP case, giving him bumps in workspace etc. Thanks for all those lovely memories mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Pramod Mahajan.<br>Fav memory: Deciding on the coordinators in your room<br>Message for him: Change a few things about yourself, and you'll be the best leader!</b><br><br>Peace.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>My first memories with Sanket date back to the initial few days. There were posts up for grabs, and a lot of us had ambitions for them. Yours truly was one of the hopefuls <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . So a few days before the elections, Chand and I visited Daddu in his room. Now, I wanted to be the cult sec, and hence asked Chand to be the CR. Chand agreed, but there was a huge roadblock. Daddu. He, in his gentle manner absolutely refused to budge from his position, and suggested that we stand for cult sec and cult rep respectively. Finally, he had his way. I remember, he'd won against Pradeep. It showed the kind of popularity he enjoyed even during those days. (Both among the seniors and our batch mates) Those speeches which we made.. Hilarious mate! Australia <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Of course, it goes without saying that Sanket has done a very good job. I think throughout the four years, <i>he</i> has been <i>the</i> CR for both <br>sections. Right from getting assignment deadlines postponed to organising the batch trip to rallying together for a cause to taking attendance in Zulu's classes, he has been brilliant! In fact, hes your quintessential neta. Some time back, Himank, Sharat, Manish and I were discussing on who was the guy in the batch who could easily convince anyone, and Himank's reply was Sanket. I think I coudn't agree more with him. You should have seen him trying to convince <br>Bezawada and Kothapalli in the BTP Viva!

<b>For <a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;<br>As Subroto already mentioned, we were among the first ones to interact with each other in NBH. I'd remember him as Vibhav's good friend, and Chika/Pagare's neighbour.<br><br>Everyone knows that Subroto is fodu when it comes to acads. He has generally done well, and got placed in a good company <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He prepared well for CAT, and I'm sure you'll crack it the next time around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The other noticable thing about him is the frankness and openness. Don't think he'll bitch behind you, he's likely to tell it to you on your face. And yeah, the smile on his face - hes always the funny guy around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We've had our differences, but I guess that happens. Do well in life.

<b>For <a href=sunilsoni.html>Sunil Soni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My favourite memories with Soni have been during Felicity '08. As a sponsorships guy, he was eager, but needed some pushing. But after some time, when we got into the mode, he did a very good job <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I still remember that long day, when HVB, you and me sat in the lab to make the list of groups and company allocation. <br><br>The best thing about Soni is the smile he greets you with. Its a short smile, but its unmistakable. Come to think of it, I've never seen him have skirmishes with anyone. Cheers to him for that!<br><br>Soni changed from a just-another-guy to a fodu guy in the second year. His grades improved, his knowledge was good and he started fodufying big time! It was an amazing transformation, something which I did not expect. He was doing very well in mock CATs as well, except for the verbal section. I'm sure you'll bell the CAT once you get rid of your Achiles' heel.<br><br>After Felicity, he even landed up with an internship in one of the top companies. It was a little sad that deserving as he was, he did not get placed in the first 4-5 days. Himank, he and I were together in our bereavement, giving the most interviews without getting placed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .<br><br>Wish you all the best in life be, May God bless!<br><br><b>Fav memory: Felicity meetings<br>Message for him: Lambu, ladki patai ki nahi? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It was the first day of classes. I entered the class and looked at formal clothes and eager eyes. The attendance was complete, and a smart professor with a moustache entered the class. He claimed to be teaching something called IT workshop. He spoke about a few things, and then put question to the class. A hand went up, and lo- it was the right answer. It kept happening over and again, throughout the semester. Everyone knows who it was <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>I will always remember Tenany as someone who has clear cut goals and knows exactly what he wants to do. Very few of us can claim the same today. But not so with him. Be it an MBA, or a Salman Khan movie or staying in NBH or working out to get rid of the tummy; he is quite clear about stuff.<br><br>Tenany is one person who always calls me "Karan" and not "Maroo". And I really love it. Even though I do not call him "Rahul" myself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Well, jokes apart, hes one guy who is very hard working- a true grafter, which comes with the clarity of thought and coordination with deed. Combine it with his intelligence, and you have one of the better jobs in his kitty. <br><br>He has been a lot of help to me, especially in the ITWS 3 project and Venky's courses. He taught me a lot of PHP during the itws project. He also has always been ready to lend me Venky's notes. Thanks a lot for that mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . I owe you one. Unfortunately, we could not do our BTP together, as I was very busy with other stuff in third year, and could not commit myself to a project under Rawat.

<b>For <a href=kharkwal.html>kharkwalg</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In my first year, I came across orkut and this thing called testimonials. Writing for others, and being written about.. I found it an amazing little thing. I wished I had some for myself. I remember that it was Gaurav who wrote the first one for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And wasn't it a very nice one? I loved it back then, thanks man!<br><br>Well, the thing about Gaurav, as everyone knows, is that he can be pretty moody. Hes this bubbly, enthusiastic guy full of those one-liners one moment, and a somber, sometimes angry and irritated guy the next. This is a little unfortunate, as it does put of a lot of potential friends he could have made. But I guess hes pretty happy with what he has. For that, I think we need to understand the Army background hes come from. And the constant changing of schools, and hence pals, something which can often be very harsh on you. Just read the testimonial he wrote for Dandu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>But apart from the eccentricities, he is one of those guys who you genuinely call 'fodu'! Let me admit, that hes been a bit of an inspiration when it comes to punctuality, thinking and time management. I've had opportunities to interact with him, and hes a brilliant chap. Add to that the effort he puts in. He can be a indecisive when it comes to decision making, but I was amazed to see that hes even selected a problem statement for his Ph.D. Already! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>He is also into a lot of extra curriculars, including (phodu) basketball and (awesome) lit talent. His English is the best in the batch and his quizzing skills are amazing. In fact, hes got an amazing amount of knowledge on a lot of fields, and has been a super quiz partner! I've lost the count of the number of times we've quizzed together as a team. He always takes me in, in spite of the fact that I've been screwing up the last few times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . The lit knowledge really helped in Felicity '08, where he did some fodu work in reviving the vertical. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahuljain.html>Rahul Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Rahul Jain. I first remember him as the guy from Gwalior who hardly spoke anything <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Well, he is like that..

<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 5</i></b><br><br>In spite of his laziness, he put in some amazing work as the placement cood. I was in constant admiration of the work he did, a fact that I never fail to mention <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Not many expected it out of him. But when he has put his mind at something, he makes sure that he achieves it. Microsoft <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And yeah, he is a perfect gentleman. Machate wai kabhi nahi dikhega <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He is very inquisitive when it comes to the world, so much so that he has been given the name "Mobile <br>Wikipedia". In fact, any topic under the sky (Or above it), you can come down and discuss with him. Rest assured, he'll have a fair bit of knowledge about it. In fact, if I ever get selected in KBC, he'll be the first one in my "Phone a friend list" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>All of his attributes and qualities leave no doubt in my mind that he'll make it really big in life, he'll get the Porsche he wants and get the hottest chick. And hence, I don't need to wish him all this.<br><br>What I'll leave as a message is that you always have my respect! Yes we can probably never reach the first year levels, but I'm glad that we are good friends now. But even in the future, I'll carry all the lovely memories. Some of my best ever!<br><br>I dont need to tell you that you should buzz me for any help you may need <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>May God shower his choicest blessings on you! Thank you.

<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 4</i></b><br><br>Movies watched on your lappy, when only you had it. Buying the same lappy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . The dance party in your wing in the third sem. Birthday bumps. Various outings in the second sem. PR. Eat Street. Traveling in autos and buses. Being Cyrus <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Buying books together in Koti. Shopping in Central. Workspace discussions. Those rock gigs. A1 group and Marathe's classes. Going to all classes together. KK at GRIET.

Over time, Adi has changed his attitude towards relationships, and he takes it easy now. His claim about people first thinking about themselves, is very right. He does not get emotional very easily, and once again I'd mention, stays very balanced. Which is very <br>admirable. Other traits of his, sophisticated, lazy etc. He must be the most brand consious chap around. Loves his cars and technology too. And rock.

<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 3</i></b><br><br>Let me start from the day we met. You remember it, do you? When I had come to your room and we hit off immediately. We discussed a plethora of issues, right from his 100 odd rank in screening to computers to football to ragging. Ragging, remember that day when I came to your room right after Jain screwed the hell put of me? I was in a torturous state, and came running into Adi's room and said, "Abe saalon ne mujhe chod diya". And lo! There were Khare and Joy standing in your room! That day, when they asked us to do the weirdest errands possible, I was in the comfort that you were there. Things would be alright <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Twenty days later, it was hilarious looking at you enacting out the 'dirty' versions of various personalities on the last day of ragging. Introvert. Shy. Thats how Adi is at the start. He <i>does</i> take time to open up. He took a lot of time to open up in the group. But once he does, well hes amazing. Didn't I already mention that?<br><br>Then there were the arguments and BC in your room with Chand and Manish. Pizza Hut treats with Chirag. Mangal Pandey with Khatri and Saket <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Aakash house skit preperations (He was brilliant as the Bengali babu. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) Those lengthy BCs about frustrations in life. BC about politics, and all the other issues. Discussing our careers. Opposing the formation of Trailblazers. The October marathon outing. Discussing the follies of daroo and the way we pledged staying away from it (Look at us now <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) . You consoling me whenever I felt sad or hurt. Studying in library. Batch trip '06. Doing OS assignments together. Night outs in the Felicity stage, playing <b>that</b> game. Singing like crazy on the roads of Hi-tech city. Chats in the first year holidays. Your idea of creating the Marathe M'am fan club.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</i></b><br><br>Well, let me also tell you the reason behind that status message of mine. I had an altercation with two of my closest friends, Adi and Pagare back then. And I was at fault. It was also my fault, that I could not understand the hurt which my closest friend felt.. My lack of understanding of his sensibilities, in spite of spending nearly all my time with him. One of the few, but very crucial altercations we had.<br><br>I often feel bad that we lost it. He was my best mate in the first year. We spent <i>all</i> of our free time together. Most of the time, I would be hanging out in his room. I'd tell him my deepest feelings, share my best moments, cry over my problems like I have never done with <b>anyone</b>. We would laugh together, help each other, leofy people and have a blast! I share some of the most amazing memories with him...<br><br>Memory, what a fascinating thing. I mean I can just close my eyes and travel back in time. But the burn about memory is that you cannot change things in time. Looking at things which you liked is good, but there are also the memories you dont feel good about. You can just travel back and look at them. Come what may, you cannot change them. And that makes it all the more painful. Its hurts you all the more when the effect is carried on over time.<br><br>How I wish I could change some of those memories.. Some of those moments. Those which brought such a good thing to an end. But then, hasn't someone said that all good things must come to an end? In such a situation, I will (again) remember something which he himself had told me. "Lets forget all our issues, and revel in those good memories". To the good memories, mate. :cheers:<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</i></b><br><br>Here is the first testimonial I had ever written for Aditya,<br><br><i>" An awesome friend n a very down to earth guy.. dis is what I have to say about Adi. Dis whiz kid from Benaras provides gr8 intellectual company.. he's got brains to match!! Can be shy at first.. but can be a gr88 friend once he opens up. Wish u all the success in life dude.. n may our friendship last " </i><br><br>Lots of things in the testimonial which still hold. Some which don't. One thing to note, is the whiz kid part. He is one of those (few) guys who came here knowing that he wanted to be a comp sci grad, a clarity for the priorities in life at a very early age. And unless things change dramatically, hes going to stick around to this chosen line of career. How many of us had such crystal clear priorities back then?<br><br>In fact, Adi's views are <i>crystal clear</i> in most of the aspects of life and the things around him. He takes his time, does a lot of thinking, but has a clear, reasoned out response to every situation or question which is thrown at him. And this ability, to put emotions aside, think logically and clearly is amazing. The hallmark of a true engineer! Be it the elections, friendship, career, relationships, job.. This ability to think in a lucid manner makes him stand out in a crowd.<br><br>"Balance is the most important thing in life", was my status message one day. (This was in the first year). Adi immediately buzzed back saying, yes it was. Personally, I've seen very few people who are more balanced in life. And thats the attribute in him which leads to the clarity of thought and deed. If there is an issue to discuss rationally, hes the man!<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Most of my interactions with Mathur have taken place in the wing, and its been fun with him around. Reason: the way we leofy him. There is this habit we (Himank, Vipul, Manish and me). One of us says, "Vande mataram", the others "Jay Mata di" etc, and his gets "cut" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We even called him up to inform him about it once <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . The problem with him is ki use hamesha lagta hai uska kat raha hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Well it is true in some cases, for example his project in LTRC! <br><br>Sambhav is known as tinka, but he can be rechristened as it as well. He can never stay for too much time at a particular place, and is one of those persons who hangs out in every wing. And he loves it.. Mixes very easily with people. His interests are varied, which allow him to do so.. CS, F1, BC etc. We share an interest in F1 and Kimi Raikonnen, and its fun discussing the same with him. I really hope Brawn gets kicked in their arse next time around mate!<br><br>He is one of the most active guys around. He also certainly the most nocturnal guy ever. He has wierd sleep timings.. You never know when hes going to sleep and when he'll be awake. Besides, he loves a drink and having a good time with his friends. However, hes been avoiding boozing for some time now, for a lot of reasons <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All in all, a fun chap and a good wingie <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Two things I'll always remember about Ankush. The way he laughs for every little joke <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . And the way he smiles and speaks to people. Can anyone get more soft spoken than him?<br><br>I've not had much interaction with him, but whatever little I spoke to him in the cellar, he was fun. And brilliant. I remember asking him to solve an iffy problem in EC once.. He did it in a jiffy! I remember that in cellar, everyone, including Banga and Sambhav would go to him for doubts. And there was nothing which he could not clear.

<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>It was sad that most of his close friends left last year, but in many ways, this year has been the time when Tullu has come of age. His influence percolating the entire batch, hes been the 'hawa ka jhonka' in every wing.. The biggest BCbaaz of the batch.. He has made friends across groups and sections, something which is very admirable. <br><br>Once incident which will stay with me. Some of us were sloshed and the topic came to Aniket. Somebody asked, "How come this chap is such a bond when it comes to lit?" . My reply was (I had more than the normal amount of alcohol in my blood), "Abe, He did not learn ABC. He started with ZABC" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>In more ways than one, this profile pic of Aniket is what he is.<br><br>Cheers mate!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Vijay Raj (Now dont kick me for this..

<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Sometimes, when I think of Aniket, it seems as if he is poetry in motion - a wave of tidings and musings flowing by. At other times, he is this languid and pensive little chap who is lost in his utopian world. For Aniket will not follow the stereotype - he is a bit of an idealist in a lot of matters. For example, I remember our recent discussion on reality shows. He was of the opinion that adventure is a pure form which should not be politicized, whereas I did not agree. There come our various tones of discords on issues, but to our credit, we've been able to brush it aside and not affect our relationship. <br>Which is how it should be. And yeah, because of it, I sometimes enjoy debating and having a chat with him. Not always though. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>An artist in its purest form, Aniket has an amazingly intriguing style of writing. Everyone knows that his blog is the best when it comes to content. Meanwhile, some of the poetry in the college irritates him, and its not hard to see why. When I look at it, he is a bit of a romantic, and loves spreading so in the ambience around him. His initiatives in this field in the college have been commendable. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>His desire to do things for the college, has well, seen him do a lot of 'things' <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Brilliant during Felicity '07 and '08, he was at the forefront of nascent ideas. Hes done a lot of other stuff.. organizing various events, the mag. In all these spheres, he is his usual self, laidback and sanguine. I think he needs to be more proactive in critical moments. But well, take a bow for the selfless work you've done <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . But yeah, he also has this unfortunate knack of getting into trouble more often than not. Disco, scuffle, guards, booze.. We've been in a lot of it together <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Samrat was one of those guys who'd always wish me with a hi and smile - a perfect tonic for any situation, when we'd meet in first year. He was always this soft spoken friendly chap who was ready to lend a helping hand. However, our interactions increased a lot while organising various events in second year- the batch trip being the most important one of them. I remember Daddu and he were in charge and assigned me certain responsibilities. That was when I saw that he had an astute understanding of things and a very good rapport with large sections of the batch. Very useful qualities, which really helped during Felicity.<br><br>During those days, often, I'd go upto Samrat's room to discuss issues which disturbed me. And more often than not, he would have some useful suggestions to make. The behind the scenes guy that he is, he put in a lot of effort for making Felicity '08 the success it was. I still remember the sketches he made for potential logos.. They were all pretty good, and this guy <i>is</i> talented. Just that I haven't really seen him putting it to use. <br><br>Samrat is also a good cricketer, something which we learnt only this year. He bowls that impeccable length and can get the ball to skit. Destructive on his day. Enjoyed playing with you, mate.<br><br>All in all, hes a potential leader with the right attributes. May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Venkatesh Prasad <br>Fav memory: Batch trip '06<br>Message for him: Punjab..

<b>For <a href=sunkoju.html>Srujan Kumar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My interactions with Srujan have been limited to those in virtue of Felicity and the other of him being Chand's former floor mate. All of these times, he came across as soft, shy and affable person. He is not known to open up easily, and in spite of spending a lot of time together for Felicity, he is still very shy. But among his friends, he is a known Cassanova, and I am surprised at that!<br><br>Srujan was one of those guys who worked their asses off for Felicity '08. He was a leading figure for campaigning and hospitality, and his extensive knowledge of Hyderabad and its colleges really helped <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . The funny part here would come when you'd try and explain something to him. He takes a lot of time to understand certain things, repeatedly asks till its ingrained- and its fun to see him doing that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But hats off for all the work you put in <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>All the very best!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Lord Krishna <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: Felicity meetings.<br>Message for him: Try and be more outgoing</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=satyakoneru.html>Satyanarayana Koneru</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first impression when you look at Satya is.. Wow! He is huge. But well, his soft spoke ness and mannerisms completely betray it. So much so, that I'm pretty sure that he'll <i>never</i> think of harming anyone. Except for bowlers and their confidence. Man, this guy can bat! And how! He can be absoultely destructive on his day. The recent innings against UG3 was one of the best innings played in IIIT under pressure. It took us to the brink of what would have been a famous victory. How Satti was shattered at the end of the match <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>The best shot which he plays is the pull. He destroyed the confidence of one of the best bowlers of IIIT, Manish Jha last time around. In an unbelievable show of power and timing, he took 18 runs off an over. The over changed the complexion and confidence of the match. In fact, he brings this calmness to the crease, and you feel that you can sit back and relax when he has the willow in his hands.<br><br>Satya also has some hilarious stories to tell, something which we realised in Eat Street last time around. His anecdote about the fat girls in his school.. Awesome! <br><br>All in all, I'll remember him as a soft spoken champion and a gentle giant. May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Inzy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: Seeing Khatri and he squeeze together in a single bike <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Message for him: Reduce your weight man! </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bkreddy.html>Kranthi Reddy. B </a></b>&nbsp;<br>If I have to count 5 of the best batsmen I've seen in IIIT, Kranthi's name will be right up there. I'd first seen him playing in the initial few days at IIIT in the erstwhile ground in front of the library. He was brilliant, hitting sixes almost at will. With that kind of talent, he walked into the house and batch teams. There was a phase in second year when he did not do justice to his talents. However, all that completely changed in the third year. There was this new found serenity and calmness about him, which saw him become the best batsman around. He seemed to be at peace with the world, the bowler and the situation. All that led to some brilliant performances, including his innings in the epic win against UG2K6. Needless to mention, he became one of the prime batsmen in the college team.<br><br>I love it when he plays those lofted drives. I think thats his best shot. His defence is pretty strong as well, and that allows him to judge the offstump and leave the ball wonderfully well. The perfect blend of attack and defence make him a perfect number 3. He can face the moving ball as well as attack when required. And yeah, hes a super cover fielder as well. Always chatting and thinking, he keeps everyone on their toes. And how can I not mention is prowess with the bowl! He just started rolling his arms a couple of months ago and had 10 wickets in 3 matches! So much so, that my place was in danger <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> However, I think he needs to be more assertive when he is leading a side.<br><br>As a person, hes a very convivial chap and enjoys a laugh and a beer with his pals. He has this passion for bikes, and owns the enviable Pulsar 200. Hes quite helpful, never refuses me when I ask him for a helmet. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And probably for the last time, aye aye captain!<br><br>May God bless, and stay in touch!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Mark Waugh.<br>Fav memory: IBCT 2008 finals.<br>Message for him: Keep playing cricket!

<b>For <a href=sriharshab.html>Sri Harsha.B</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>I fondly recollect all those Felicity incidents mate. Deciding on the core committee (a very difficult task); convincing people to work; deciding on designs; addressing various meetings; the fight over me not informing you stuff (you were right back then <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ); various meetings with the financial council and the way we used to bitch about them after the meeting <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (sorry finance waale); deciding on campaigning strategies; going to companies together, especially Progress software <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ; praying for the festival; The Indian Ocean fiasco and finally witnessing the best Felicity ever! And the fun moments... Leofying you with the names of various girls; gossiping about relationships  (we did that a looooooooot! <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ; bitching about people; talking absolute shit in the lab; leofying Sahiti.. Man I so very long for the Felicity moments to be back!<br><br>Apart from Felicity, I must mention that though he might repel you off at first, hes a very nice chap. Hes the first name who comes to mind when it is help for his friends. He put in selfless work for the placements too. He is also someone who'd speak out his heart, which was again very important for our working.  He hates it when we speak in Hindi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Come on man, you have to learn it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Besides, hes the laziest guy you'll ever find. His room, like mine, is always in a mess. And he had (has) a crush on a couple of girls from our college <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . <br><br>All in all, one person who I'm unlikely to ever forget. Get your MS quickly, and lets start an event management company <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .<br><br>You raaaacccccccck Mama!

<b>For <a href=sriharshab.html>Sri Harsha.B</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>For Harsha came as a whiff of fresh air for Felicity '08. He was a person who was determined to learn from previous years mistakes and see the fest grow. Initially, we had a lot of problems and issues.. As I mentioned, we are both very different people. Both of us had different ways of approaching the fest, different priorities, varied things which we wanted to see in Felicity '08 etc.. But over time and after a couple of skirmishes, we realized that both of us had similar aims- to see a bigger and better Felicity along the lines of our ideology. I remember the meeting we had in your room regarding putting aside our differences and working for the larger cause. We had one important ground rule- not to fight in the open. And I must mention, that both of us stuck to it except for that one day of the press conference outside 119. Even then, we promptly resolved the issue and got back to work <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Slowly, as the days passed by, the tension in our working relationship started changing into mutual respect for each others views. Later on, we became as united as one could be, and at the risk of sounding haughty, I'd say that it was one of the crucial factors for what we could achieve. Let me mention here that though hes a lazy person by his natural instincts, he really worked <i>very</i> hard during Felicity. And I mean it. He tried his best to contribute wherever he could. Testimony to that is the sponsorships field, where inspite of his limitations, he got us some of the best deals. Hats off to him for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . It was a good thing that he knew most of the people in the batch, and assigning responsibilities and pushing people became easier. Must mention here that he is a natural leader, people tend to respect him a lot once they know him.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sriharshab.html>Sri Harsha.B</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>While filling the (un)necessary details for the yearbook, I came across the memorabilia question. Without any hesitation, my fingers typed in Felicity '08. Now, when I think about it, its amazing that two guys as different as chalk and cheese were at the helm of it, trying to give the fest a direction. That is how passion for a cause can drive things!<br><br>The story of Harsha and me has largely been the story of a dimension of Felicity altogether. Let me start from the bits and pieces before that. It was the first day of classes, and he came up and asked me to do something. I was like, "Wtf", and then he told me that he was a senior <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Like an obedient dog, I did what was asked of me. He saw three girls of our batch walking in the front (I wont name them <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) and asked me who I liked! On the informals day, he got me introed to some pretty girls from the 2k4 batch (wow!) and made me do some silly little errands, which I enjoyed. By this time, I had started talking regularly to him, till that day when I confessed to Jaws. Sorry for that incident mate, I realise that I should have spoken to you before trying to save my ass.  <br><br>The next time, I remember interacting him when we were giving the Freshers party to our juniors. While organizing the event, someone told me that Harsha will be a good guy for the hardware stuff. Thats when I approached him for the same, and I must mention- he was pretty good at it. The event passed off smoothly, and we developed a working relationship. <br><br>Fast forward to Felicity '08. It was the issue of selection of coordinators. Some nominations came in, and all of us who'd sent the same decided to meet and decide. At that point, it was Harsha who I turned to to mediate when a couple of us had issues. Back then, we finally decided to have Harsha as a coordinator, and I must say its been one of the most important decisions ever.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i?><br><br>Ahh.. And I also recollect his entertaining batting during Summers '07. I would always try and get into his team, thanks to the shots he played. And, I've never seen him miss anything in volleyball! Wish he'd have played it earlier.. He could have been an asset to Aakash House!<br><br>And yeah.. He becomes a little cranky when it comes to girls <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Though hilarious, some of his comments on Mahaveer's post (as Cracker) on girls were very controversial. It was fun though, it led to a long ensuing discussion! I've often seen him pulling GKB's leg over the issue of girls. Even during the third sem, when I used to hang out with one of my female friends, he would leofy me with her name <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .I think he's one person who needs to find a girl quickly for himself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All the best in life, buddy!<br><br><b>Person/character he resembles: Combination of Kitty from 70s Show and Matthew Hayden (for the sweep shot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )<br>Fav memory: Tutorials in your room<br>Message for him: Get a girl!</b><br><br>Peace.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=deepakvig.html>Deepak Vig</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i?><br><br>I hardly remember Deepak from first year. He was this silent soft spoken guy who I never interacted with. In second year, I moved to cellar, a place where I made a lot of new friends. And Deepak was one of them. He was my neighbour, and I must say that I was very lucky to have him as one. First of all, he'd always have a lot of stuff stacked up in his fridge. That was the time, when we had this gym fever and his boiler was very helpful <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . <br><br>Vigla is also a fodu when it comes to using new technologies, especially in the web development field. That was the time when we had the ITWS-3 course, and I often coudn't make of what to do with the assignments. During those days, all I had to do was hop out of my room, jump into his room, grab something from the fridge while he would solve my problem <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I've had a lot of sweets in his room, which was a bit of a meeting place for all of us at cellar. I remember all <br>the BCs we've had in his room. Even during exams, the tutorials would always be taken in his room- and the sweet guy that he is, he'd never refuse <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . One of those tutorials saw 20 people filling in the room! I'd also bug Deepak for movies, softwares and what not.. And he'd always lend his helping hand.<br><br>During third semester, we also had the Sunday Carnival, where I asked Vigla about organising an event. We decided upon Treasure Hunt, and boy.. It turned out to be among the best events that day! I think it was his first event, but he managed it brilliantly! After that hes done it numerous times, and am sure he must be knowing every nook and corner of the campus now <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His technical skills saw him organizing CacheIn for Felicity '08, and I must mention, it was very well done <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>We often get provoked or think about getting back at our adversaries for shit they would have done. But 'anger' and 'enemy' are two words which are <br>non-existent in DJ Ranga's dictionary. You'll never see him get wild at anyone or anything. Instead, he meets every situation with his famous bubbly spirit and energy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Ranga is someone who can instantly liven up the atmosphere. He always tries to provide entertainment, be it by his wit, or a game of antakshari. I've seen that he often takes the initiative to do so, and that is so very sweet of him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Case in point, the journey during batchtrip. <br><br>That spirit also comes from the basic friendly nature of Srirang. Hes a friend in need, and a friend indeed. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He's also active in the college and its affairs, especially in the cultural field. I remember the various treasure hunts Vig and he organised. Besides, he is a very lively singer with a terrific stage presence. Even in spite of a lot of competition, he is likely to beat it because of the charm and liveliness he brings to the stage. Another thing which comes to my  mind is that he's our very own Mr. Bollywood. Any song or movie, hes not just likely to know, but also have an opinion. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I remember doing the ITWS project together, and it was fun. Sachin sir ka kaatne mein maja aata tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . And yeah, thanks for delivering the IIM-I news to me mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=nitin.html>Nitin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I'll remember Bansi as a very quick witted person. The situation just has to present itself, and he's there with a reply. I've seen so many occasions when he does that- and starts to leofy someone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His sense of humour is cheesy, and its fun to be in his company. Gupta, Rishi and he often hang out together and choose a victim for leofying at the drop of a hat <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Hes changed a lot over the years in his outlook, now he listens to rock, grows long hair and follows Arsenal FC. Hes also a fun loving guy, and his "Tu chalo, mein aata hoon" is well known <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . And yeah, I also remember his bowling along with the smooth action <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He worked hard for placements, and it showed the way he kept getting shortlisted for companies. I was happy when Rishi and he finally got placed in Motorola.. They really deserved it. Remember dude, mere liye ek cell phone ka waada <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Character he represents: Harry Potter<br>Fav memory: He getting placed<br>Message for him: Abe baal aur lambe kar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I so very agree with Aniket when he says that Sharat is the definition of coolness - in more ways than one. I have never seen him agitated. Most of what you say is going to be met with a sweet smile <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And yeah, he nods his head to whatever you say. I remember all the lit meetings during Felicity '08, it was amazing to see him maintain his demeanour always. He was pretty good at all the stuff he did for the fest. The lit part was almost entirely revived by the efforts of Kharkwal, Narang and him. <br><br>The thing with Sharat is that hes always bubbling with ideas, in whatever sphere it be. His ice cool demeanour allows him to analyze and situation and come up with creative solutions. A few days back, I was amazed listening to his idea about extending the domain of 108 to local colleges. Similarly, his ideas for Felicity were brilliant! I think hes a guy who can be a brilliant entrepreneur or consultant <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>His exploits in the literary domain are well known. I love his writings, they're pretty cheesy and whacky. And yeah, hes not far behind when it comes to fooling around and having a good time. Refer 3rd day, stage events, Felicity '09 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .<br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Character/person he resemles: Dexter, Rajdeep Sardesai<br>Fav memory: Lit meetings for Felicity '08<br>Message for him: Do think of a career as a consultant <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sachin Goyal. I first knew him as this chap from Vizag. Like all those kids from the corporate college hostel hells, I thought that he's probably a maggu. But I was wrong.. A perception completely changed about such guys <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I found Sachin a cool and laid back chap. Just like his gtalk id suggests <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But whats with the 13 dude? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>A lot of my interactions with him took place in the cellar, where I lived in my second year. I remember him as the pizza and sleep chap.. Always wanted one of these two! Add to it his long hair, unique way of leofying and an out-of-the-way style of walking and you have a terrific combo <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But well, he proved that he has a lot of substance in him during the placement season. I remember sitting together for the Citrix interview, how we described our interviews to <br>each other and how he managed to crack one of the best companies. Cheers for that, mate!<br><br>The first time I was sloshed, I remember crying a lot. And he was one of the guys whose shoulder I used for the support. That was a day when we all got senti, and I told him ki, "Tum cellar waalon hum logon ke saath kabhi nahi ghumte.. kabhi humse baat nahi karne aate. Tum hum sab se nafrat karte ho" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I'm all smiles when I look back at that moment today <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Dude, we still have those parties pending, where we've promised to booze together. I am sure we'll have one helluva party!<br><br>Apart from all that, Sachin's also a good friend for people around him. Dependable and trustworthy, he also enjoys having a good time. Eighth semester, of course, has taken us to the heights of vellahpanti, and ain't he the first one to be loving it? <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ahh..

<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>A lot of what I wanted to write about Prateek has already been written. Ideal. Super cool, even under pressure. Amicable, with everyone. In the initial days, it was people like him who were the bridge in the so-called 'north-south divide'. Guys like him were so important for the unity of the batch, and he's been one who's worked tirelessly towards it. And its to his credit that I can proudly say that UG2K5 is the batch with an unprecedented amount of harmony and conviviality within the batch. I mean, there is so much positive energy, that one doesn't have to bother about politics and shit when he/she goes out to do something good.<br><br>I remember him as this silent chap during the first couple of years, but he was a very important cog in the Felicity wheel. In the initial few days, I remember that it was he who tried to bring peace. He was the one who brought Prudhvi and me, and urged us to work together. Later, he was there in every department of Felicity, giving suggestions, running for deals, designing tees, getting DJs, campaigning in colleges, pushing people to work. In each of these aspects, he generally remained cool (I saw him lose it just once.. During the tee shirt thingy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) and tried to reason out with people when required. I was very impressed by his demeanour, cool and gentlemanly behaviour. Besides, he has always been sincere about giving back to the society, which can be seen by the brilliant work for Samvedana, and the work during Felicity.<br><br>All in all, an amazing chap who's very difficult to forget. May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Kimi Raikonnen.<br>Fav memory: Arguing about Felicity tees.<br>Message for him: You should be a little more assertive.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=saurabhsharma.html>Saurabh Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>Over the years, we've moved our separate ways, but I still enjoy his company. The Ooty trip with him was awesome.. And you should have seen the chemistry Piyush and he shared <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> That was also when we leofied him like crazy about something related to Liverpool <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Remember that conversation? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . And yeah, remember the car trip when everyone spoke about their crushes? And also, the Mocha waala outing! Along the way, this chap has also become lazy- I thought he'd be one chap very active in college affairs (I feel that hes a potential leader), but it was not to be. I was also disappointed that he stopped playing <br>cricket after winning us the IBCT finals last time around.. But then priorities change. I've also noticed that he is one chap who'd stick by his friends, always.<br><br>All the best in life, mate. <br><br><b>Person he represents: Shammi Kapoor in Junglee <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: All the mails we sent from your room in the first year.<br>Message for you: Dude, we still have our first year cricket challenge left!

<b>For <a href=saurabhsharma.html>Saurabh Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>My first memories with Saurabh date back to first year, my first few days in college. Saurabh was this cool chap who always had the choicest expletives on his lips <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> In fact, I learnt a lot from him.. "Beti c***" remains my favourite <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . We'd heard a lot about Saurabh from the seniors (among who he was very popular), and when I tried finding out, it turned out that he was my wingmate <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Back then, it was these 4-5 guys who you kept hearing about "ki yeh aaj ragging de ke aaye hai".. Pagare, Chand, Daddu and Saurabh the most prominent ones. So, I started hanging out with him and realised the amount of fun he was! You HAVE to hear him scream.. Amazing that he starts off for the smallest of things <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . I remember the discussions during Freshers we had in his room.. He had decided to stand for Mr. Fresher and told us "That he was going to act". Its unfortunate that he didn't reach the stage.. He would have been a very good candidate otherwise <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . I also remember Khatri, Saket, he and me persuading Piyush to stand for Mr. Fresher based on his singing talents <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And yeah, huge <br>thanks to him for all those days he allowed me to use his cell phone for the super stuff he had <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>First year also marked the time when he started following football (He was a die hard cricket fan earlier, and is still a very good batsman) and it has been no looking back since then. Trust me, hes the biggest Liverpool fan on this planet! You have to hear him the way he talks about 'his' club.. The passion and enthusiasm is unbelievable! He always refers to Pool as "hum". He can go to any extend to support his club, and I was amazed by his plans to buy a part of it <br><img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Seriously man, for the passion you have, hats off! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>(continued..)<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rajatnarang.html>Rajat Narang</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I was discussing with Himank and Khatri on which character represented Narang the best. We unanimously agreed on some of the things he is - refined, balanced and sophisticated. And that was when we came up with the personality which comes towards the end of the testimonial <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Well, not many would differ on what Narang is. Through my interactions, I have also found him to be a very reasonable person who uses logic to get out of any quandary. Though lazy, he is passionate about a few things. Sports, for one. I'll take back all the discussions we've had on cricket, football, F1 as well as tennis. We never discussed wrestling though, I'm not into it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . But he has a good knowledge base in all of these sports. The other, would be CAT and management. I really hope that the results tomorrow are favorable for you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I've enjoyed all the discussions we've had. Being in adjacent wings and having certain common interests has helped. We managed to get placed in the same company as well, though I'm sure you'll not have to join it <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . And ahh.. We'r both among the 'rare ones' who've attended a DISCO in IIIT <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Can't forget that day as well.. While collecting the letter from BLN, I was in tears, but he stayed composed and balanced. Other memory with him.. Meeting him on the first day in IIIT through the same mentor group. Remember that both of us were asked to propose Arpita Sharma <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . He also put in good work in Felicity '08.. He has some very good ideas in the lit domain. <br><br>May God bless!

<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My neighbour in the classroom, and one guy who's changed a lot over the years. From the first two years, I remember him as a nice chap but someone who always cried about something or the other. Especially acads, which incidentally, he is very good at. However, all that changed to a considerable extend since he moved to cellar, and "Bajju" can be seen everywhere now. Volleyball, hanging out, BC, daroo...<br><br>In first year, I remember sharing my PC with him and Dandu in the workspace. He was always a guy who was serious about assignments, and we often had to make slots so that we got enough time on the comp <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He was also very sincere when it came to lectures. Kapil, he and me had a lot of discussions on different issues in the classroom though <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . In third year, I recollect Bajaj being in our group for the Middleware assignment, and how he fodufied it and rescued us <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And of course placements.. There were two guys in the batch who were very serious about it right from day 0.. Bajaj and PK. Needless to mention, they have the best jobs today <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Kapil is also a database of sitcoms, and we've often argued on 70s vs friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . He has a good build, and enjoys a game of basketball. I'll also remember him spiking in volleyball, with all the enthu. <br><br>All the best in life, mate!<br><br><b>Character he represents: Rocky <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: Leofying him for being 'Baba'<br>Message for him: Learn to take it a little easy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=amitkabra.html>Amit</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kabra is infamous for asking far too many questions nearly always. But once, when I had a chat with him, he had something very interesting to say. He said that all his doubts are genuine and not just-for-the-heck-of-it as we think of it. Its that he has a lot of curiosity and cannot resist asking. Its to his credit that he has been this way all through the four years.<br><br>It is also to Kabra's credit that he had the tenacity to stay on when he did not get placed- beacuse he knew that he was good enough. Memories with Kabra include the all-Hyd trip in first year (during Dussera), CAT chats, watching him play football for the batch etc. <br><br>May you get all that you deserve!<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Angus from Two and a half men<br>Fav memory: First year trip<br>Message for him: Stay cool <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kabeer.html>Kabeer Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In Indian folklore, you often come across Sardars who'r always jolly, smiling and in a good mood! Well, had never met such a person before until I came across Kabeer. Happy-go-lucky Kabeer is a very intelligent chap, but unfortunately, he hasn't been putting it to use in college. I remember our CAT discussions, he was always the one with the best and fastest solutions to any math problem. It was English which was always his Achilees Heel, but he has immense potential to make it to one of the major B-schools. <br><br>You cannot write a testimonial for Kabeer without mentioning football. Be it playing or watching, hes at the forefront of it. In fact his entire wing is extremely passionate about the sport, and is referred to as the 'football wing'. However, Kabeer is a follower of a lot of sports- your quintessential guy who wears tracks and is always ready for a game. I've seen his basketball, and its brilliant! In first year, I remember challenging him to a 100 m dash. Being the guy he is, it was immediately accepted. Needless to mention, he left me high and dry after the race. In fact, hes among the best athelets IIIT has seen.<br><br>I've enjoyed the discussions in his wing (along with Narang) on football and CAT. It was also fun to be a co-tutor in CN, wherein all of us (Kharkwal, Harshita, Sushma, he and me) would always try and run away from responsibility <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Also enjoyed the discussions on HIMYM, downloading, Delhi.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All in all, hes the definition of coolness.<br><br>Stay the way you are mate.

<b>For <a href=charan.html>Charan Thota</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The first thing which comes to my mind when I think of this chap is "mass" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He is everything which defines the same- rugged looks, rough accent and the like. But when you get to know about this guy, you'll all agree that hes one helluva chap, a gem. I have never seen him turn down a request from a friend, or from anyone for that matter. Add to this his friendly demeanour, and you have one of the most popular guys in batch. Its that popularity which led him to an election win over his good friend and the other popular guy, Chand. <br><br>Charan was one of the most active guys during Felicity '08. Normally a lazy chap, it was wonderful to see his dedication for the fest. In fact, his role started right at the start of it all, when we were all trying to sort out the coordinator issue. Ultimately, his efforts towards a solution were very important. And it was wonderful to have him managing a good part of the thankless hardware business. I'll never forget the Felicity days mate <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>This guy always has a chillax attitude towards life, which leads to more than the requisite slackness from him in the first two years. However, over the last few months, hes put his priorities in order and life in perspective, as a result of which he really started working towards his academics. I have seen in him a genuine wish to do well, which is the first step to success. Having taken the first few steps, I am sure you'll do well in life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Ravi Teja <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Fav memory: You getting placed.<br>Message for him: Get out of your laziness <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

In fact, the OSO idea and its final stage execution were brilliant. Handling so many people at once was not easy, and he pulled it off brilliantly. However, I must mention here that I was disappointed at the way he handled certain situations during the event. He asked me if I wanted to be a part of the dance, and I said yes. But for some reason, he kicked me out <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . But hell, ultimately he put in a lot of good work, and thats what is important. Cheers for that mate!<br><br>Other memories with him include the IPL auction and the tournament <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , hanging out together in first year, Ooty trip, Gudbud, Charm++, doing the harman baweja dance together <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=khatri.html>Gaurank Khatri</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>In some ways, Khatri must be the most misunderstood guy around. "Khatarnak Khatri", rofl at that. He is definitely not 'khatarnak', what with those mushy Shah rukh Khan movies and stuff. I have <i>never</i> seen a more die-hard fan of SRK than him. I mean, in Bangalore, he'd revise KKHH after every few days <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> In fact, hes crazy about Bollywood, and made sure that we watched atleast one movie every weekend in Bangalore. It was one helluva' time we had over there! Movies, dining out, weekend trips, foosball.. We had an absolute ball! And his sense of humour.. It made the stay a lot more fun. The way he'd leofy Pagare was awesome! In fact, you've got to see him BC-ing when hes in the flow. There is not a person on this earth who he cannot leofy! And entertainment is guaranteed when hes at it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His BC-baazi goes beyond that, and he is a known master at convincing people and making them follow his point of view. A perfect quality for a manager, I am sure he'll be a good man for such roles.<br><br>I have other memories with Khatri, the most prominent among them being the DISCO in 2006. It was a nightmarish experience, but something which we look back and smile at today. Somehow we've been co-troublemakers, with both of us being involved in the scuffle and daroo case as well! Apart from these, Khatri was my wing mate in the first year, and among my first friends. I remember the BC we had in the first year, along with Saurabh, Saket and Piyush <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Khatri has <br>also been a constant in the batch and house cricket teams, and its been a pleasure bowling with him. These days, Khatri is quite dedicated towards his fitness, and gives 4-5 hours to his body everyday. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> You got to look at the way he tries to dominate any game he plays <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 4</b></i><br><br>Chand is one of those guys who wants to be good at whatever he does, and he generally is a very talented person. He is a dedicated body builder with airs of pompousness about him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He is a terrific dancer and one of the pioneers of Aari-aari. And acting.. Wow! He can act out anyone and can imitate wonderfully well! Who can forget his chor-police act with Sambhav. Or his act in Freshers '05. (Needless to mention, he was the Mr.Fresher of our batch). I remember all those nights spent in Saket's room in cellar preparing for the play. I must confess that i was quite envious of Chand back then.<br><br>Being all that he is, Chand has a way with the fairer sex. He loves chatting around with girls, and was actually a bit of an ass in the first year. (You know what I am referring to, dont you <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) Of course, hes changed a lot now. But hes still the butt of a lot of gossip linking him to girls. Again, that comes with his nature and popularity. Heres hoping that you find your dream girl pretty quickly <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>There are so many other memories with Chand. I'll try and jot a few of them down.<br>* Contesting for elections in first year as allies, it was me who used your popularity actually <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>* All the BC and discussions in Adi's room in first year.<br>* Forming Trailblazers, and the pioneering role you played in it.<br>* Leofying you for not taking me home in the first three years. <br>* Diwali 2008 (finally) at your home <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>* Second sem, and the masti we had.<br>* Organising Freshers, carnival and I-day in third sem together. Absolutely loved it man.<br>* Working out in third sem.<br>* Politics and discussions about so many issues concerning the college <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>* Discussing acads and Felicity in fourth sem.<br>* The infamous scuffle in fourth sem and the role you played.<br>* The way you fought for me for Felicity '08.

<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>Ahh... Coming to that, Chand is never short of an appetite for BC. Its as if bakar is constantly running in his head <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He just cannot stay without talking. Sometimes, I wonder how a person can have the capacity to chatter <i>so much</i>. I mean, I just get bored of BC after a point of time. This chap wants to go on and on and on. But to his credit, it is BC which you enjoy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Having a good sense of humour, he has often been at the receiving end of far too many leofying sessions <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . But credit to him that he takes it all in the right spirit. Also, being the BC-baaz that he is- its him whos often the oil in the machine in the group. Part of that also comes from the fact that this chap has absolutely <i>no ego</i> when it comes to friends. I mean, even if he has a fight with someone, he'll take the initiative and immediately sort it out. I've seen very few people with such an attitude. Hats off to him for that. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I'll remember him for sorting out innumerable differences among guys. I also recollect the fight we had in first year, and the one we had recently over me banging your door <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And how you sweetly came up and said sorry both the times, even though it was my fault. <br><br>But talking about dealing with people and relationships, I also have a complaint with Chand. He is often inconsistent with what he says, and that sometimes gets on to you. I think you definitely need to change that part about yourself. The good thing is that he hardly ever gets angry, and when he does- well, then God save the other person! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .I know- having been at the recieving end once!<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>But today, Chand is far from that. Always ready to lend a helping hand, he is a known trouble shooter across all batches. To me, the greatest example for this was provided during Felicity '08. Though officially, he was a design guy, Chand was everywhere. When I needed someone to talk to the website guys, I'd turn to Chand. When I required a balming hand to smoothen ruffled feathers, he was the first person who'd come to my mind. When I needed someone to talk to Dr. Mitra, he was the guy. In fact, when drunk for the first time, I remember crediting him for being one of the coordinators for the fest. He was the one who'd initiated discussions on Felicity '08. He was the one who fought for making sure that I got to be at the helm. That is something which I can never forget. Whenever we ran into design issues, he would sit up the whole night and come up with a design which no one could refuse. He got us some of the best deals with his charm and persistence, including EA mobile. He got about coordinating with the organizers and allocating volunteers. In short, he was brilliant. I still remember how he'd often come down to my room for Felicity-BC. A lot of issues would be solved right then, with some brain storming from our sides. Those were the favourite days of my life in IIIT, and Chand was a major part of it.<br><br>It will not be wrong to say that he is the most important 'neta' in IIIT <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Neta is just a term, but well, once again, hes there everywhere. As a Parliament speaker, hes one guy who thinks a lot about the college. Once again, hes the trouble shooter for various issues, and has been a crucial factor for maintaining positive relations between the faculty and students. Due to this, and the fact that hes the biggest BC-baaz around, you'll hardly ever find him <br>in his room.<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>Subhashis Chand. A man of many facets and aspects. Egotistic. Amicable. Able bodied. Leader. Many memories associated with this chap. So much so, that I just don't know where to start.<br><br>The first thing one will notice about this guy is that he is as friendly as one can get. Right from your first meeting to the latest, he remains that way. Be it the guy at the subway counter or his closest buddy- he seems to be equally friendly to everyone. I remember that in first year, he was one of the first guys to come up and talk to me. In fact, thats when people around him start to think that they cannot especially get close to him. Thats how it stayed for a lot of time- with all the friendliness, he is not one who'd readily share with people. Its a bit of an irony that it takes a long time to win his trust or get him to open up completely about himself. Irony, because people readily open their hearts to him, even in the first few meetings. In fact, thats one very <br>interesting trait I've noticed about Chand. His friendly demeanour urges everyone to start sharing with him even though vice-versa is rarely gonna happen (unless he is really drunk <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) <br><br>When I look back now, Chand has definitely changed a lot over the last four years. Personally, as a good friend of his, I have seen him metamorphosize from a guy who did not share to otherwise. Its another irony that he has <i>always</i> been a guy who speaks a lot about himself (but does not share). However much he may refuse to accept this, everyone knows that he is one chap who can go on and on about himself. Even now (though it has reduced). This was one aspect of his which really turned me off in those initial few days. I found him as one self-centered brat.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One word which comes to my mind when I think of Chacha is feisty. Animated, intelligent but often weird, Kulbir is a very interesting person with a uniquely brilliant sense of humour. He has a witty remark for every situation, which is often enjoyable, but gets irritating sometimes. He is the kind of a person who will do his thing- get obsessed when he likes it, but will never do it if he doesn't. And that is something very admirable. Everyone knows that hes the king <br>when it comes to technical problems and Linux. Everyone knows that he loves playing around with the network and is probably going to be one brilliant entrepreneur. Actually, we need more guys like him who are ready to do their own thing.<br><br>I'll also remember Kulbir for his old moustache. Like the other Saini, he shaved it off later. This skinny chap also loves hanging out with his friends (especially in the coffee shop) and fooling around. I also fondly recollect all his rendevous with various professors in the classroom. <br><br>I wish him all the success in life.<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Chacha Chowdary from Pran comics<br>Fav memory: Volleyball matches<br>Message for him: Sometimes, you need to be judicious in what you say.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Casanova or GKB. Actually, its a terrific name, whosoever gave it to him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> First things first, Pankaj is one person who loves to live a very good life. He likes doing things in his own imitable way. He has a way about women, and loves talking about it <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . I still remember the conversation we had in second year about his love life, and the girl he had blogged about. In fact, I've shared a lot of interesting conversations with him, especially in second year when we were both in cellar. I still enjoy the chat sessions I have with him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Love his attitude towards a lot of things, and life in general.<br><br>Saini is an avid co-reader and I've picked up a lot of authors on his suggestion. The best among them, of course, has been Ayn Rand. He is also a movie freak, and unfortunately, I do not share this trait with him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> But beyond all the masti, hes also one chap whos concerned about his career, the effort he put into CAT preps was a testimony to the same. I really hope that he does make it big in the future.<br><br>Pankaj was one person who put in a lot of effort into Felicity '08. Really liked the way he went about doing things for the hosp and camp section.. He was pretty dependable and responsible <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . I remember how he was frantically trying to arrange cabs and stuff <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He generally has that attitude, always ready to <br>help out friends. Certainly has it in him to be a good leader! Ah.. And hes also a very good blogger, his literature has improved a lot over the years. <br><br>All in all, a guy who lives life to its fullest. Cheers mate!<br><br><b>Person he resembles: Vijay Mallya<br>Fav memory: The 5 hour chat on yahoo messenger in second year, inspite of being neighbours!<br>Message for you: Keep the spirits going!</b><br><br>Peace.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 3 </b></i><br><br>In second and third years, we maintained a constant friendships, and his academic exploits continued. I really do hope with all my heart the he gets the gold medal. Fourth year was when I moved into his wing, and it was all on an upswing <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He would be a major part of the "wing mein machana" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Remember, filling our bottles together, morning breakfasts, "Manish-Janise", Friends vs 70s, the various nicknames and the leofying done by Bhalu (its quite easy to get him <br>irritated), tt etc.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I'll never forget this year, its been amazing staying in THE wing. I'll also take back the fact that he always supported me during my CAT and placement preps, he was one constant encouraging factor <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Thanks a lot for all that, mate!<br><br>I really hope that one day, you make it big as one of the best professors around. Yes, considering everything, I still think that its the best career option for you; one which'd really make you happy. But hell, if you want to start a company, just ping me once <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>All in all, I'll remember Manish as a good friend who always had this smile on his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 2 </b></i><br><br>But not just in the academic sphere, Manish absolutely loves to excel in whatever he does. You got to watch him playing tabletennis. Or volleyball. Or gymming. Or public speaking. He has to be the best, and can go any lengths to achieve his goal. He hates losing, and it is this attitude which I love about him. Its this attitude which will take him ahead in whatever he does. Its not that he consiously does this, but this attitude is ingrained in him. However, <br>along with this comes a problem. Though hes a quick learner, he often does not listen to what others have to stay. Far too often for his own good, he is too rigid on what he thinks. I think he needs to be much more flexible.<br><br>Manish also likes playing by the rules, in whatever aspect it is. He does not like to meander and will never 'stray' too much. Hes the only teetoaller in the group. I admire his resistance to temptation. He'll rarely do something which goes against the rules. He is the only guy whos been locking his room everytime <br>he goes out (be it for a couple of minutes) right from first year on. Or consider his attitude towards girls. I have a feeling that he'd never do <i>anything</i> which'll even remotely hurt his folks. Once again, this aspect of his is so very admirable.<br><br>My first impressions of Manish as Chand's roomie was as this guy who was always smiling. Come mid sems 1, and one could see his core aspect at work <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . From first year, I'll also take back your scp case, the BCs we would have in Adi's room, the group. Ahh.. Mentioning one more aspect of his- he does not share much regarding his relationships. Not even with his closest pals. He is one of those guys who takes time to open up about himself.<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>Manish aka dassi aka jaat is the closest humankind has ever got to academic perfection. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Loaded with oodles of talent, he is one of those guys who'll manage an A or A- even after 'screwing' up his exam. Testimony to the same is the Physics exam in the first year where he cried after the paper on the pretext of failing the course, but ended up being the topper! That was the day when we decided that its futile consoling Manish! The reason being the no-reason to console him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . But hell, whatever be the case, this chap would always stay as focussed on his acads as one could be. Everyone knows about first year, when Maruti's pc would be playing stuff and Manish never ever bothered to turn his head when everyone else was watching. Well, today, if we go <br>back to workspace and the same thing happens again, Manish will not watch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>The wonderful thing is that inspite of his brilliance, he is your next door guy with no airs whatsoever about him. He is as humble as one can get. Always ready to help out people, he was a God sent boon during the placement season. Having landed with a top notch job himself, he spared no effort in teaching the guys in the group and outside. In fact, I've never seen him turn anyone down from teaching OS. He was always very concerned about us getting placed and did everything he could for the same. We owe it to Manish for our placements!<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilagrawal.html>Kapil Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My interactions with Kapil started in the classroom- thanks to the seating arrangements we had. We also had adjacent PCs in the workspace and I fondly recall those good old days. The good old days of joint classrooms and workspaces, and a lot of social interactions. We (Kapil, Bajaj, Dandu and me) would have a lot of discussions in the classroom about varied stuff. Thats when I realised that Kapil is one chap you want to be careful with- he can pick up on any of your <br>utterings and start leofying you on that. And his style of leofying is unique, he'll give you a wierd look and a change of expressions which makes you think, "Why did I even say that?" Its happened so many times!! In fact, he is a pro at leofying Bajaj <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Kapil is big time into sitcoms and movies, and his knowledge in this domain is impeccable. Hes seen most of the sitcoms on LAN, his biggest competitor is probably Bajaj. He is generally quite chilled out and loves having fun. Also, he has a good female fan following; but I have never seen him interacting with the fairer sex!<br><br>However, there is a lot of clarity in his mind about what he wants to do in the future. It was evident when he opted out of placements. I really that hope he makes it big in business, and does his MBA from a top notch B school. <br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b><br>Character he resembles: Billoo from Pran comics.<br>Fav memory: Conversations in first year.<br>Message for him: You got to be more proactive!<br></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>All in all, Chirag has been one of my very good friends at IIIT. May God bless!<br><br><b><br>Character he resembles: Rotlu from Jaane Tu.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Fav memory: All the meals after AIMCATs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Message for him: Think about relationships.<br></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>The next thing you'll notice is that he can be hilarious at times. Coming with the masti-waala attitude, he is the king at leofying people and not getting leofyied himself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He has a whacky sense of humour, and the timing of his comments is often impeccable <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Even when he manages to crack those PJs, he does so in mota's ears <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> However, you'll get an adverse reaction when you do get around to leofying him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Everytime you do that, he'll say, "Haan saale! Tu to aise mat bol" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Chirag, however, is dedicated and sincere when it comes to his work. Always the one to do things on time and in order, he generally lives the day according to a schedule. For example, I admire the fact that he always has his bath before lunch time, which is a rarity <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> When he has a particular goal in mind, he silently goes about doing his job with focus and dedication in heart and spirit. However, along with this also comes the rone waala attitude <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I think he needs to change here and be more positive about things around him.<br><br>One more aspect of his which can change is being more open about the talents he possesses. For ex, hes a pretty good dancer, but is always reluctant to do so. Hes also quite good as basketball, and plays in the intra college tournaments. <br><br>But well, along with these also comes the control which he exercises in most aspects of his lives. I mention most, because there is always the daaro <br>exception. He goes berserk when a little alcohol is in his body, and is sometimes fun to watch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> What was not fun, though, was the Holi incident (it was memorable though). That day, Piyush and I feared really bad things. Thank God, you got out of that situation!<br><br>The other things I'd remember are the work he put in for Felicity '08, daaro sessions with him, taking various courses and BTP together, preparing for CAT and all those AIMCATs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ..<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>The first thing which I'd say about Chirag is that he was the first friend I made in IIIT. Also it comes with that- hes been one person who I've been friends for the longest time (along with Adi). I dont know how we met, but I remember meeting his grandpa at the start of the semester. I still remember that I'd regularly visit his room (totally ignoring his roomie) very often. Those were the days when the three of us - Adi, Chirag and me would hang out together quite frequently- I can recall all those visits to Pizza hut, the movies etc. Back then, we were the sincere kinds- all that changed after the gang was formed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>What you'd notice about Chirag is that though he is friendly, he never opens up. Even after four years, none of us feel that hes ever shared with us. Well one of the reasons for the same is that Chirag is the kind of a guy who does not think too much about relationships. For him, the funda of relationships is quite different- little skirmishes do not affect it, Which is always good. When it comes to other things in life, he does share- but zilch in terms of relationships. Its good in a way that it does not leave scope for getting hurt. However, it leads to a feeling among the ones around him that hes not ready to come close enough to them which is a little unfortunate. For it creates a kind of a line or a wall which cannot be breached by anyone. I think the cure for this is from both ends; from the side of friends, they need to understand him and from the side of Chirag.. Well my suggestion is try telling your parents that you love them <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Its the best starting point)<br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

And no <br>exhaggeration, those were some of the best days we've had! Before the Microsoft internship, I only knew him as the guy who kept visiting Vig's room in cellar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But we hit off quite well in Bangalore.<br><br>Our day would start with breakfast, and you cant help but notice the kind of passion he has for food. He loves eating, and was the one who'd finish all the biscuits in our section of the office! I'd certainly advice a woman that the way to his heart is through his stomach <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Offer him a buffet, and he'd love it! We'd reach work, where we would push off for foosball. Foosball, well we loved playing it.. It was our most important activity everyday <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Khatri and Paro would be in one team; Pagare and me in the other - they would beat us 7 out of 10 times! But we still had the verve (especially Pagare) to keep <br>challenging them for a scoop of the 'Gudbud' sundae icecream <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The next thing you'd notice about Paro is when you hit the gym. He is obsessed with looking good and getting photographs clicked. I even had to click a pic of his in the changing room! He loves putting up new pics on orkut <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Ask him about his innumerable <br>rendevous with chicks <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Other lovely memories include the Ooty trip (remember the cut); leofying him left, right and center (Khatri's fav victime) <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ; Wonderlaa; shopping together..<br><br>A prominent part of him is the independence and clarity about what he wants to do. He always had a lot of passion for his ideas, and kept talking to people about executing the business. He has the passion to do his thing- which is the first and the most important recipe for success. Hes also very hardworking- something which I've seen both at Microsoft and college (placements). He had the tenacity to keep going inspite of the setbacks of the first few days and hats off to him for that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Hes also a keen learner at every stage, which is very heartening to see.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I first met Rohit during cricket practise sessions for Aakash House in my first year. I remember him as this fodu bowler, whereas my balls were being sprayed left, right and center. During the first two years, Rohit along with Pagare formed a potent new ball combination both for Aakash and the batch. They were pretty good together- I even remember Rohit taking the ball away from the right hander. And then there is his lusty hitting- on his day, he can whack any bowler out of the park. Add to that his brilliant outfielding, and you have a very good cricketer. Its a little sad that his bowling lost the edge in third year, but he kept working on his game (he has worked quite hard for it.. would attend all the practise sessions) and is coming close to his top form slowly. If that happens in the finals, then God bless UG3!<br><br>Rohit has also been very active in the other aspect of college affairs. He was one of the major guys behind Felicity '08. He had so much enthu that he not just did his duty as the finance ka member, but also contributed hugely to the campaigning and hospitality department. Actually, he was quite suited to these roles as Rohit is essentially a very soft spoken and down to earth chap. If Rishi was this iffy strict guy in the finance council, Rohit was the one who <br>would use the balm to good effect <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He did brilliant work for the campainging dept..

He acts very funny sometimes, but can really surprise you with his levels of knowledge of a lot of fields. In fact, he makes for a very good quizzer. I must also mention that I really enjoy some of his blog posts- They'r pretty imaginative and humorous. The enthusiasm he has for literary stuff is <br>amazing.. I remember Sharat and him frequenting Yorks. <br><br>My favourite memory with him would be Felicity and its aftermath. He was responsible for guest lectures, and I remember how much I would irritate him to get the work done. I also remember that the night after Felicity, when we were sloshed, I said something to him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Now I don't remember exactly what (I remember being a little apologetic); but I must tell you that you've done some brilliant work for Felicity- Sorry if I was ever rash during those days <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the best in life buddy, May you taste the sweet honey of success.<br><br><b>Character he resembles: Jughead from Tintin comics<br>Fav memory: Getting sloshed after Felicity '08<br>Message for him: Be more confident about yourself and whatever you do.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Scientist- another of those guys who always has a smile on his face. He is sincere little chap, who is always looking for ways to improve himself. I really like that about him. And a very valid point which Bajaj made- he does crack fattas, but a lot of those are called PJs because nobody has an answer to them. He is still as inquisitve as a child, which is so very refreshing. But yes, it does get onto you at times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I will remember Sainani for the conversations we've had on the dinner table. We'd talk on a plethora of topics- from sitcomes to cricket to life to Jeevan Vidya. In fact, hes promised that he'd have his first beer with me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> That day has come buddy <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>Its also been fun leofying him. That comes with the urge to hit back at his PJs. But hell, he takes everything with a smile on his face. I have NEVER seen him getting agitated. Which is wonderful. I'll also take back all the gtalk conversations I've had with scientist. Apart from recollecting his wonderful poems and dreams <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>May God bless!<br><br><b><br>Person he represents: Prof Calculus from Tintin Comics<br>Fav memory: The conversation with him on why people booze <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Message for him: Do not restrain yourself, there is no stopping you.<br></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 5</b></i><br><br>Next, the water cooler tradition (started by him and me). Everytime we have to fill our waterbottles, we take each other, Manish, Vipul, Chand, Kshitij and Mathur along. Anybody who refuses is given the strictest possible punishment!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> It is as if we've become kids all over again. Remember "Dishum dishum" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In fact, I've absolutely loved this wing, its given me such sweet memories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I'm really gonna miss all this <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Ahh.. Staying in this wing, I've also noticed his wierd habit of laughing out really loud when he is alone and watching sitcoms. Everytime you hear loud claps and laughter, you know its Himank watching That 70s show <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Haha!<br><br>Placements '08. Everyone knows how it was. We were the comforting factor for each other. We would always count the number of unsuccesful company-interviews we'd given; and I remember Bhalu, Soni and myself being in the lead. I remember the CA interview, when he didn't get through. We were all very sad, and Adi (who was with him then) called me and asked me to console him. I tried, but it was very difficult. That was one day when we could really feel the pain. And <br>come 18th December, the next day. Ivy Comptech, both of us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Destiny. What relief we felt back then! That night, when we were BCing in his room is one of my fav memories. Yes, we had got placed- but it did not feel alright. First of all, how could we (especially Himank) face Chand, with who he was supposed to get placed? And second, we felt so wierd that most of our close friends did not even congratulate us (even a few days after getting placed) (The former is understandable to an extend as the others had not got placed then) And the final count - Himank 7 companies, me 6 companies <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 4</b></i><br><br>I also remember the poor chap going behind IV to get money from Microsoft <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Post Felicity, we'd have a lot of BC on the same. And the daroo party after Felicity - awesome. I also remember that after the farewell daroo party last year, he was the one who dragged me back to my room at 5 AM in the night so that I could attend Amazon's internship interview. Atleast I got to give the interview at 10 AM the next morning in a state of hangover. But for him, I'd have missed that! Its also the right context to mention two things- one that Himank is the biggest boozers around and two his MS internship, which he got through without much preperation. Oh.. And yeah, hes scared about me for something which I cant mention here <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>How come I haven't mentioned his blogging as yet? Maruti and he were the guys who originally took up blogging in the batch, and they've continued it to this day. His child-like obsessions with the blog comments and hits is amazing, and everyone knows how Himank would bug everyone till they visited his blog. Both of us also conducted the first IIIT Bloggers' meet. Btw, visit his blog at lifeizlikethat.wordpress.com <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>And Sachin.. Sachin is his biggest passion after numbers. As fellow cricket lovers (add Pagare to it), we've had some amazing discussions on cricket, especially when sloshed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Both of us keep discussing all matches, and enjoy reading the cricinfo commentry <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>In fourth year, I got to shift to THE wing, and luckily have Himank as my neighbour. We have had some fabulous memories in the wing! I christened him as my 'Guruji' and he has been the one to defend me whenever I get leofied! So much so, that I am on the other side of the table now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The way we leofy Maglu in OBH mess- rofl!! Everyone else would get irritated, but we would go on and on! Absolutely love that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Every night, Chand and he would have the BC-sutta (<img src=Smileys/10.gif />) <br>sessions, and I've always enjoyed joining in (only the BC part).<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 3</b></i><br><br>Come second year, and I moved to cellar. That was when I started hanging out very regularly with this chap. I remember leofying Maruti like crazy. And the rock (He is crazy about Beatles) we'd listen to in his room. Or the stinking room which both his and my room would be <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Or the regular BC sessions in the corridor. It was at that time that we started going for walks together.. And we'd discuss a plethora of things. In fact, it was with him that I went for a walk along the MS corridor for the first time. And he is the one who discovered how cool a place the new main building terrace was <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The evenings spent <br>there.. Awesome! <br><br>A lot of those walks were devoted to talking about our personal issues. First thing, like all of us, Himank has also changed a lot over the last few years- his ego has certainly gone for a spin. He is the kind of guy who always likes his friends to be united, together during the good and bad times and is very touchy about this. He is a huge well wisher for the people he likes. Yes, during those walks, we'd also talk about people <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And one of my most memorable walks with him was during the scuffle incident- when I kept trying to convince him something. But yeah, he doesnt like it when he keeps trying to convince <br>others about joining in for an outing, and people disagree. Case in point, the recent Holi when guys did not join in inspite of a lot of persuasion. He went red with frustration and anger!<br><br>Another of my favourite memories with him has been organizing MnM in Felicity '07 together. Rathi got busy, and it was upto two of us to do the event along with the junis. And we had an absolute blast while doing the same! Himank, remember that girl in pink who comes around every year? And how you refused to let her participate? Haha. It was an amazing moment when MnM finally got over and we got to hug each other. The experience helped him in being the main organizer <br>for MnM in Felicity '08, which was again very succesful.<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>He loves just lying around in his bed, chatting, twittering, blogging, browsing, BCing.. All at once! I just cant see how he multitasks so easily.. Its just the opposite for most of us.. In fact, I had to switch off the music in order to be able to write this testimonial! He absolutely loves social netowrking, and just cannot stay without the same! I remember he (and <br>Pagare) checking their scraps everytime they'd go for BC to someones rooms. Ahh.. And I also remember how desperate he was to get to the 1000-scrap mark before 1st year vacations. I think he was among the first persons to do so. Congos for that <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>But inspite of being very lazy, this guy has always managed to do well in his academics. His flair for numbers is well documented. He did very well in CAT in spite of hardly ever bothering to prepare for it (Coincidence that we managed to screw the same section up). However, an MBA's probably not the thing for him. He has other passions, and we'd all love it if he decides to pursue them. Well actually, hes confused about what hes gonna do in the future, and I think <br>thats a good sign. I say that because it shows that hes thinking about his life and career. Which is a big thing in itself <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>My next memory of his is after the gang was formed.. That of his new cell phone camera. The camera (inspite of being a VGA) was a craze back then, especially given that NONE of us had camera phones back then. And the amount of photos we've taken with that phone.. Unbelievable! He also has a fetish for SMSing, especially the fairer sex! Ahh.. and coming to that, hes always had a queer relationship with females. There are some females in his life who are neither girlfriends, nor sisters, nor friends.. But are still very close to him! And in spite of having way with the ladies, hes managed to pass the four years in <br>college without a girlfriend! Needless to mention, a lot of us think that hes among the most frustrated souls around <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I wonder when he'd find his dream girl!<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</b></i><br><br>I am about to embark upon one of the most exiting journeys possible, that is writing a testimonial for Guruji <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its been such an amazing journey, one which seen absolutely no downs! Our friendship has hardly ever (read never) seen skirmishes and its been an uphill journey (if I can use the expression) throughout. I must thank God for blessing me with such a friend!<br><br>Lets start right at the beginning. In the initial days, I just knew him as that 'chutiya' from cellar who always hung out with that other 'idiot', PK <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Of the few times I visited cellar, I found him very irritating. In fact, I found a lot of people in cellar wierd at that time <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Fast forward to Dussera 2005. It was for the first time that we really got a break from the crazy first year schedule. We had a lot of time on our hands, and were wondering what to do. <br>That was when I suggested that we go and hang out for the entire day and a lot of people agreed. I was chosen to show people around, having a fair knowledge of Hyderabad. I remember a lot of guys joined in.. Himank, Adi, Chirag, PK, Shrikant, Raman, Kabra, Manish, Shashank etc. And we had an absolute blast that day! We visited a lot of places.. Central, Lifestyle, ccd, bakers inn, hi-tech city, cyber pearl and that resturant.. It was an amazing day. That was when I first started interacting with this guy. And I realised that hes not such an ass after all <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> In fact, I found him very funny!<br><br>That was the starting point for our dosti. I remember the way he used to play stick cricket in workspace. And his always chilled and relaxed attitude. He would be among the last guys to start off with Jawahar's assignment and always finish them all! But he was (and is) as lazy as one can get. Just try moving him out of his room when hes lying on his bed. It is nothing less than a Roadies 6.0 task!<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhilash or 'abhilashi' is not an easy person to understand. Trust him to never stick to the cliches and do his own thing. Who can ever forget the frankness he has with the professors in the class? Especially Zulu <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He has a bit of a habit of questioning authority and thinking deep about stuff which he'd do. <br><br>I admire Abhilash for some of these things. He is an intelligent guy who'd put in all the work required for achieving his goals. I admire him for his academics and his coding skills. He is also a very good sportsperson. If you want to find him in the evenings, you have to go to the ground. He plays very good volleyball and football. <br><br>We were good friends in the first two years. Staying near NBH-47, he'd often help us out with all a lot of academics related stuff. We also hung out together, I particularly remember one incident when he came to a resturant in shorts <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I also recall FSLD (rofl)- fucker, sucker and the like; his awesome style of speaking, Mrs. Marathe's classes etc. Things changed after that when we moved to OBH and he didn't. Also, I was not happy with his work in Felicity '08- I expected a whole lot more from him. I guess that pushed us furthur apart. <br><br>But all in all, I still respect him for a lot of things, and hope we can stay friends for a long time.

<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I'll also remember summer '08- Bangalore and Ooty. Khatri and he were hilarious, and it was laugh a minute with these guys. Actually, he is a funny guy, but gets a little irritating at times :| He is also known for his size, and Manish leofying him for the same <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Other memories with him include the scuffle, the daroo session two days back (rofl at that dude.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ), the leofying sessions, his birthday an year back <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All in all, thanks for all the support mate.

<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Piyush Nigam. Our first memories go back to first year, when he'd always hang out in Saurabh/Khatri's room. Back then, I didn't have enough knowledge about Hindi expletives, and these guys never lost opportunity of leofying me. In spite of that, I enjoyed their company. I still remember those plans we'd make in that room (regd college ki ladkiyan) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Shit man.. Back then, I thought he was a pervert. But hell, hes exactly the opposite. He really respects the girls he likes, and is a famous brother <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . His idea of romance is also quite different. Add to it his emotional nature, and you have a perfect package for the ladies <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Fortunately or unfortunately, we fell out with the 2nd floor gang, and that was the time when TB was formed. Being very close to Pagare and friends with Chirag and me, Piyush had to be there. Piyush, of course, was the senti guy and he needed support when he had some personal issues. Thats when we got to know each other better- somewhere around that time we also had the DB case. But we've managed to come out of all that, haven't we? In fact, Piyush now has the <br>best job in our batch, which looked like a dream back then. Credit to him for that. Hes proved that he is extremely intelligent and can put in the effort when required. His Amazon interview- absolutely brillitant. I still remember hugging him in the coffee shop after the results- He actually broke down. <br><br>He is also a friend who'll be there when you need one. Testimony to that- the ragging case, the Chirag incident, placement tutes etc. More often than not, he is ready to lend a helping hand. Hes also a fab designer and put in a lot of effort for Felicity '07 and Felicity '08. He came up with some brilliant designs and posters <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He is quite creative. And yeah, hes also a good singer <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I remember Saurabh, Khatri and me convincing him to stand for Mr.Fresher just on the basis of his singing talents <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>First of all, I must thank Harsh for any credit he gives me for for IIM Indore. After all, he is going to pass out of the hallowed portals of IIM-B after two years <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But hell, this guy is way too good for any IIM to ignore him. So help or no help, he had to get through IIM-Indore <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>HVB has been consistently brilliant with anything related to academics. A nine pointer, honours, an internship in the best company around, a great job and 6 IIM calls. Hats off, brother <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I really do hope that he makes it big in the world of management, because hes very fit for the same. He has good people skills, and has good relations with a lot of people in the campus. Never the one to hold back from speaking out, he is comes across as quite frank. Besides, hes always been at the forefront when it comes to college affairs.. Ragging, campus life, cultural, felicity.. I still remember the number of events we (Chand, Sambhav, you and me) would take the initiative to organize. He was always good at doing so. But yes, he has asked me if I was not happy with his role in Felicity. Hmm.. Well, at the start of it all, I expected you to play the most important role in Felicity. You certainly did play a subtsantial role, but not of the magnitutde I expected out of you. However, no hard feelings about that- I understand that you had other priorities back then. But well, we still had our moments togther- Bharastudents, onlinerealgames <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Harsh was the one who'd get angry at a lot of small things. However, this aspect of his has been changing, and credit to him for that. He is also a very friendly chap, whos nova is always available <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And yes, he has very little of this thing called ego, which is very useful when it comes to friendships. And that explains his large set of pals. Other memories with him include Pink Panther in City Center Calcutta, Batch trip, Freshers '06 etc.<br><br>I not only hope, but am sure that you'll make it big in life!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>Placements saw him (along with Bansi and Gupta) come much closer to our group. Adversity increased the bonding in the batch. I remember the amount of work this chap had put in. I'll also remember that I was the first one to give him a hug after he got placed. It was a fab moment, especially after all that he'd gone <br>through. <br><br>The other things I'll remember about Rishi- watching cricket together; the way he says "Bharat" instead of India <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ; the zoo trip with him; batch trip in 2nd year; meals together in the mess; leofying people together and getting leofied etc. And yep, I'd certainly remember him as the person "capable of doing anything" <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All the very best in life!<br><br><b><br>Person he resembles: Micheal Bevan<br>Fav memory: His reassurance to me after the Indian Ocean fiasco<br>Message for him: Chak de phatte!<br></b><br><br>Peace.<br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rishig.html>Rishi Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>In the future whenever I'd think of Rishi, I'm sure the first thing which'll come to mind is the smile. The constant smile and the chillax attitude makes him one of the coolest persons around. Always relaxed, people are often scared ki "Rishi sabke saath mil ke unki le lega" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is undoubtedly a pro at pulling your leg <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>I'll also remember Rishi for being a man for all seasons. Koi bhi event ho, you just need to call him for help. He'll be there. I remember, when we were asked to submit names for the finance council. I thought of Rishi and went and asked him. He was like, "Maroo, tu jo kaam dega, mein woh sambhal lunga." It was awesome to have just dedication for the festival! And needless to mention, he was brilliant when it came to handling finances. He was fairly strict with <br>the finances, and we could never take him for granted. He kept us on our toes throughout, be it collecting money, making budgets or whatever. And at the time of the "Indian Ocean crisis", he was sane enough to not only keep his cool and rebudget the entire thing (with Rohit and Aditya), but also assure me, "Maroo <br>to chinta mat kar. Hum sambhal lenge, tu baaki saare chize dekh". The amount of reassurance I got from that one statement from Rishi was enough to carry me through all of the second day (after the nightmare of a first night)  Mate, hats off for all the work for Felicity '08 <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Rishi is also a good cricketer and footballer. Both of us have had similar fortunes in the Aakash and batch cricket teams- in and out in the first two years, but into the respective opening roles from the third year. Though he has a limited footwork, he has often provided good starts to the team, including the epic match against UG2K6. Add to his batting his brilliant fielding, and you have a very good cricketer. Of course, I can never forget IBCT 2008 and our <br>victory <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 4</b><br><br>Come Felicity '08, and he was one of the backbones of the same. Along with others, he managed the cultural part very well, and was one of the troubleshooters during Felicity. In fact, he has been at the forefront of many activities in college, especially sports. <br><br>I also fondly recollect our joint frustrations at not being able to manage a girlfriend! Well, hes the one whos always spurred me on in mission-gf <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I often get inspired by him <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Pappu, remember the talk in Pyramid about girls in a mall? <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Well, I'm buzzing with so many other things to write that I'll list them down.

He'd be more sedate with me, but in a bakar waale mood with Himank.<br>* I still remember Felicity '06 rock night and our frustration at the 'craziness' of the rock show. Look at us now! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>* Middleware project night outs with Chika, Ganja and Bajaj. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>* BTP with Chand and Chika.<br>* The Ooty trip at the end of third year.<br>* Daroo sessions. <br><br>(continued..)<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 3</b><br><br>Pagare's funda about friends is that you always live with them, for them. He has set high standards for friendship. It might be a cliche, but he is absolutely always there for you as a friend. In my first two years, whenever I'd fall sick, he would be the first one to take me to a hospital. I can never forget that. In fact, hes done a lot for all his pals. But well, hes often been let down by his friends. And being the kind of emotional guy he was, he'd feel hurt by the same. But then again, he has changed a lot over time. Hes moulded himself, and he has much lesser expectations from his mates now. He also is less into the senti-menti stuff now, hes become more stable in the mind and heart. I guess its all a part of growing up, and comes with the maturity you achieve. And I would take a lot of negative credit for that. There were so many instances when I'd let out some shit and let him down. There were these innumerable instances when I really hurt him. But credit to him and others (Bhalu, Adi etc) who often helped us patch up, and our friendship is still going strong.<br><br>In our group, hes the one who makes a lot of plans. It comes with his basic nature, which is the inclination to keep having fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But well, he has a lot of lofty and wierd ideas as well, which never get executed <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I've done two internships with this chap, at Greenspace after 2nd year and at Microsoft after 3rd year. And both have given us some very memorable moments. Right from the first day at Barista to the flight back home. Earning our first ever pay cheques at Greenspace was an awesome experience. We'd go to office, drink some coffee, orkut a lot, have lunch, orkut some more, have snacks and come back <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Well, it was not too different in Microsoft <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Only thing, we had <br>foosball too then <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Paro, Khatri, Piyush, Pappu and me had an absolute blast in Bangalore. Wonderlaa, the trip to Ooty, Kanti ke parathe.. Well I'll remember all of them. In fact, refer to my blog for more details <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>But forget the dance for a while, Pagare is oozing with talent! Its almost as if when you touch him, some of the talent will wet your hands. Its another matter that hes not always utilizied them. For example, this guy can be an awesome author- some of his posts on his blog are a testimony to that. But well, its his priorities in life which are actually very simple. He just wants to have a good and simple life, lots of fun and great friends and family. Thats it. No hefty ambitions, nothing. And due to that, I feel that some of his talent has been lost in the process of going with the flow.<br><br>Talking about talents, I'd do injustice to the testimonial if I do not mention cricket. Hes one the best cricketers around. His inswingers, lethal. His bunny, the best batsman in IIIT, Ruhela. For me, hes been an amazing captain to have. From the 15th man to a player in the IIIT squad- all credit to Pagare and Varun for that. And his inspirational speeches which he gives to the UG2K5 batch before every match <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Other memories here would be the awesome wins we've had as Aakash house mates and last year's win over 2K6. In fact, the 2K6 win and the subsequent party at Eat Street counts among my most memorable moments in IIIT.<br><br>Talking about memorable moments, there have been a host of them with this chap. Its almost as if we have been linked together by destiny.. Internships in Greenspace and Microsoft together, similar courses, same BTP.. In fact, during the placement season, it was the butt of our jokes- we thought we'd ultimately land up in the same company. Fortunately or unfortunately, hes going to Pune, and I feel for him. After all, hes one person who just cannot live without his pals and absolutely dotes on them.<br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>Abhijeet Pagare. Lots of memories associated with this chap. Sweet, bitter, fun, frustrating.. Its all there. One of the closest friends I've managed to make in campus. Somebody who knows everything about me. Someone who always makes me laugh, and also someone who I often end up hurting. But everytime, he is there again. As a friend. As your mate. <br><br>Well, I'd infact call him the walking definition of friendship. Be it his intricate knowledge about all his friends' lives, their feelings, their habits etc. Be it his habit of handing out just the perfect nicknames to his mates. Be it his idea of playing "Yaaron.." just after the conclusion of Felicity '08. Thats one of the most beautiful moments not just with him, but with the entire batch. Pagare got the song played and unbelievable scenes followed. Everyone came <br>together in a circle and sung the lovely song along. I could see moist eyes all around me. And after that, well, few of the best hours. It was my first ever booze, and well, the effect it had on me was out of the world. All my emotions came gushing out after the 'sabha' conducted by Pagare. Ahh.. and that 'sabha', bloody hilarious it was! Well, this chap can be very witty; with a twirl of his fingers, he can make people laugh. Many a time, he livens up the mood with a witty remark or comment.<br><br>The other thing about his 'sabha' thingy is that this guy loves being the cynosure of all eyes. And its not just that, hes got the talent to back that up. Everyone can testify that hes the best dancer around. Its such a pleasure to see him execute his moves on stage. I keep telling him, "Pagare, I've always wanted to learn dance." and he keeps urging me to take it up. Hell, after some classes, I've realised that its not my cuppa tea <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Memory associated here, would be the "Aari aari" dance sequences <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ahh.. And Salsa, hes always been wanting to take up salsa classes for obvious reasons <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But hes not got himself to do so even after 4 years of post teen singlehood! <br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 2 </b></i><br><br>Thats her.. She'd always stand by her friends, come what may. Shes also the biggest well wisher for her friends.<br><br>I also remember the really long walks we had. She loves gossip, and I enjoyed those sessions with her <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its so easy to leofy her, just tell her that you know something that she doesnt <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And then you have to look at her reaction <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Those walks also had me seeing her other side, where we often spoke about personal issues. I also remember the MacD treat <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Third year saw her putting in her best for Felicity. Ahh.. And how come I didn't mention it as yet? Shes a fab singer. You've got to give the ears when shes in the flow! She is now in the college rock band.. Quite a journey its been from the salwar-wearing-ms-fresher to the babe-in-the-rock-band. Shes also a very good dancer, classical as well as western. In fact, she has a pretty good dressing sense right now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>All in all, Harshita's the kind of girl who is simple, not too complicated. She tries to look at the world through a very bright x-ray. Shes a kid at heart, though she may not accept it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But yes, I'd say that its now the time for her to grow up and adjust herself accordingly (Though I'll urge her not to change her basic nature). Because that is something which makes her special.<br><br>Cheers to our friendship. May God bless!<br><br><b><br>Characters she represents: Geet from Jab We Met and Sally from Coupling <br>Fav memory: Remember the talk we had about crushes <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>Message for you: Keep the bubbly spirit alive!<br></b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>Harshita. One name which brings smiles to the faces of many of us <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> That should say a lot about her. In fact, the word which'd perfectly go with her is "bubbly". Shes as chirpy and bubbly as one can get <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> That comes with being very friendly with most people, in fact a little over friendly sometimes. The thing is that she cannot always draw the line, something which can land her into trouble. She needs to learn that quickly, after all its gonna be the corporate world (hopefully) for her soon. But well, its also the quality which makes her one of the most popular people on campus. Her friends cut across people from all batches, and Harshita M'am is a very popular phrase <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its that thing about her which always keeps the mood alive when you'r with her. Shes one person with who its very difficult to feel uncomfortable with!<br><br>Being a pretty young lady, she loves flaunting it <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She loves compliments, she absolutely dotes on people giving her so. Its very easy to cheer her up, just pay her compliments on looks and how shes grown thin <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ahh.. thin, shes really worked in order to get into shape. Fat foods out, exercising, gymming.. Hats off to you for that buddy <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Am pretty sure you'll be in the perfect shape one day <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> And get that perfect guy as well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I remember that we hardly spoke to each other in the first year. It was only in the second semester that we started interacting. I remember her as a fat and chubby girl from then who could never stop speaking. Of course, shes changed a lot. Well, back then I remember leofying her in front of a lot of people in workspace and she was damn pissed! Anyways, it was through her that I had a sort-of-girl-who-I-briefly-dated <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> That was when we started interacting a lot. In fact, I fondly recollect those third sem days. She stood by me during the ragging-disco case, she came and told me that everyone did. Back then, I was touched. It was the kind of support during those tough days which really made our bond strong. <br><br>(continued..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Three words describe Mux the best- friendly, funny and outspoken. Its fun to listen to what hes got to say about a lot of things. And his smile.. It never leaves his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I still remember his outspokeness and his dialogue with Zulu in Compilers classes. They were awesome! He had the chutzpah to stand up and say what he wanted to. Mux is also very friendly and helpful. Hes the portal guy- umpteen times has he been asked to put up a portal, and hes never refused <br>the same. The yearbook included, thanks Mux <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The other memory with him is the tutorial he took for the Gandhi course, it was informative as well as hilarious. The way he taught along with his child like enthusiasm <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Mux also has a blog, which is very funny <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The piece on Maglu.. Dude, rofl at that.  <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Never knew his creativity, it should have been harnessed!<br><br>May God bless you with all the happiness!<br><br><b> Person he resembles: Vinay Pathak<br>Fav memory: Zulu's classes and his chutzpah<br>Message for him: Dont let your talents die.<br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When I first met him, I said "What a funny name". When I next met him, I said "What a funny guy". You'd look at Maruti and thats what comes to your mind- of how he manages to get leofyied time and again <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But beneath that layer, hes a very soft person. Always ready to lead a helping hand, Maruti is a bit of a geek. I say a bit of because though his knowledge in Linux and computers is awesome, hes not the typical geek- he listens to rap (Hes the original slimshady <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ), he enjoys a good conversation etc. And talking about Linux, poor chap is always pissed off when he sees people who cannot yet install Linux on their <br>machines! (I must admit I'm one of them <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) I remember, when in cellar, how people used to flood him with their tech queries. <br><br>I'll also remember Maruti for the leofying sessions we had with him. Himank and me have a lot of iffy pics of his on our phone-cameras <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> It was fun, he loves being called Kelso <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> It was fun having Maruti around, cellar was incomplete without him. It is very sad that "Billu" has slowly moved away from the lives of our group. I'd call it unfortunate circumstances under which this has happened, a result of which we're not close friends any more. In fact, I even remember one of thos booze sessions, where we urged him to talk out; but we went to sleep instead :| But hell, its hard not to remember this chap- affable, fun, sweet amiable, geek, intelligent and a bafoon <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>All the very best in life! May you achieve whatever you want to.<br><br><b>Character he represents: Micheal Kelso from That 70s show<br>Fav memory with him: His unbelievable fattas in his room<br>Message for him: Think, when it comes to relationships.</b><br><br>Peace!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 3 </b></i><br><br>Some of the conversations we've had have been awesome! When both of us get together, we do bitch about others sometimes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I must admit, it is fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I'd also remember the umpteen breakfasts we've had together in OBH. Its a routine- One of us gets up, knocks at the other's door, we freshen up and go down for breakfast, often as much as nothing being spoken. It often remainds me of, "You dont need to have a conversation with a good friend, his mere presence is enough". I'll also take back the BCs we'd have in the morning. Often, Himank, Chand and co. would BC their lungs out throughout the night in the corridor, and we'd talk about getting frustrated in the morning <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> And the support hes given me during my CAT days was amazing, he'd often egg me on. <br><br>All in all, its been an amazing journey- from "hello and hi" to being fab pals. Wish you all the best in life mate, and remember, you can count on me always. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>May the force be with you! <br><br><b>Character he resembles: Pooja in HAHK<br>Fav memory: Morning conversations in his room <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I'm gonna really miss that!<br>Message for him: Stop being so cynical of the things around you.</b><br><br>Peace.<br><br>(concluded)<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 2</b></i><br><br>But here, because of his reclusive nature, he tends to take a cynical point of view of things once too often. Its not always black, and I think he needs to recognize grey in life, and accept it. That has of course changed over time, but I think this aspect of his needs to change. I often feel it comes along with your shyness. But yes, he has been flexible- changed a lot especially considering his background. From a soothsayer to a next-door-drinking-pal, hes had one helluva journey! Drinking sessions are not complete <br>without some guys getting senti- and Vipul is one of them. Ah.. and when drinking, the big five thingy, rofl dude <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He prides himself on not puking, but that mith has been broken now <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And how can I not mention, hes one of the most sophisticated guys around <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And yeah, hes also taken over as the shopping king <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Jokes apart, he sometimes goes 'silent' when we're leofying him- and thats what we're scared of. When he goes silent, we dont know whats the problem- whether its something which we said, whether its his mood.. Haha. Anyways, thats the next thing I think he needs to change, take things in hs stride and make it clear when he doesn't like things being said. As for his ambitions in life, well he never speaks about them. But hes a guy who'll always be your-friendly-next-door-neighbour; I do not expect his basic nature to change. <br><br>Hes helped me a zillion times. After my third year, when I was in Bangalore; he shifted all my belongings (Which is a very difficult task I must admit, my room is among the messiest in campus) voluntarily, so that I do not stay isolated in my old wing. I was really touched that day. I felt sad when I hurt him when I was sloshed. But since then, things have changed so much that hes the first guy that I'll turn to for help. I'll also remember the so-many-times when I'd call him up for help- could range across a lot of things and he'd always oblige. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Part 1</i></b><br><br>Vipul. One of my closest friends in IIIT. We hardly ever spoke in the first one and a half years, but my moving to the cellar in NBH helped me create a lot of new bonds. Vipul is the one among the them which I cherish the most. <br><br>We started interacting beacuse of our waking up times, I still remember those 8'o clock walks to OBH for those yummy parathas (Of course, with the customary Rs 4 change <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ) At that time, I found him a very wierd person-I would go to Raman (his roomie)'s room and chat with him for a long time without as much as exchanging a hello with this Ajmeri. Actually, thats how Vipul is- shy and reclusive initially, but at his affable best when you'r a friend of his. In fact, we've often to do with what I'll call 'Vipulisms'- hes at his best when hes leofying Chand. Poor Chand, his neighbour! Well, I'm the other neighbour <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Ahh.. <br>So third year brought us a lot closer- We didn't interact much before Felicity, but a lot after that. We spoke and really found that our frequencies often matched. <br><br>Let me take a break here and talk about his essential nature. First thing, he does not open up immediately- he takes a lot of time to do so. You need to win his trust, but after that hes as good a friend as you can get. In fact, sometimes I think we have let him down as pals. He is always there for you when in need- but I'm not sure if we've done justice to him when hes needed us. But he'll be there for you, rest assured. Hes clean as hell- walk into his room and you'll <br>not feel as if its a hostler's room. Thats one of the major reasons why a lot of BC takes place in his room; something which can get onto you- especially when you like stuff to be in place and when you'r an early-to-bed kind of a guy. Hes a homely guy, warm and nice and clean and neat. A lot of it comes from his Rajasthan background. You'll find all the stuff you need in his room. Which makes me feel, agar Vipul nahi hota to hamara kya hota. <br><br>(cont..)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>And yeah.. I gave her the name SUKDI!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sukdi sukdi sukdi sukdi sukdi<br><br>Ah... That feels much better <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I'll always remember Prashasti from first year. Secluded, shy, a kiddo and yet silently confident. No doubting the fact that she's changed a lot over time. She is a person who does not makes friends by the dozens- but when she makes them, she sticks around and expects the same from them. Very few people are close to her, but those who are- extremely protective about her. Says a lot about her, doesn't it? After that, she's immersed in her own little sweet world <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Whether she is ambitious or not- I don't know. But I know that she can easily achieve whatever she wants to- She is supremely intelligent. Besides, she applies her intelligence to what she does. Ahh.. and athletics- she's the best of them all! <br><br>I'll always remember the work she put in for Felicity '08. Brilliant, selfless work in the hospitality and campaigning department.. She along with Srujan, Aniket, Rohit and others. She's always spoken about the batch and its unity, a strong advocate for the same. I'll also remember first year, and the skirmishes we had <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>All the best in life buddy, May God bless!<br><br><b>Person she resembles: Maybe Shobana Bhartia or Shikha Sharma<br>Fav memory: The walks with her in first year<br>Message for her: As a toad in the water, look beyond your well.</b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Padhai-likhai, organizing events, college ke affairs, volleyball, ghumna firna, bc.. He's always there. Rather than 'tinka', I'd call him superman! His dedication is exemplary. His mannerisms are brilliant. A perfect gentleman for the ladies. His wife will be one lucky female. He's always ready to help you out.<br><br>However, this chap rarely opens up. He talks, he laughs, he listens but he does not really speak his feelings out. He is diplomatic sometimes- but generally to good effect- Its generally an avoid confrontation situation- He's like Jai in Jaane tu ya jaane na. Yes, that sweet!<br><br>Lot of memories associated with this chap- Freshers and Carnival, cellar BCs, Graphics. However, my favorite memory with him is undoubtedly on the stage of Felicity '08. As soon as it got over, a lot of us, including me were numb. People came and hugged me. I didn't know how to react. It's when I hugged him that both of us broke down- literally into tears. That moment will remain etched in my memory forever.<br><br><b>Character he represent: Jai in Jaane Tu..<br>Fav memory: Felicity '08 - just when it got over<br>Message for you: Be the way you are dude.
