<b><a href=pankajanthwal.html>Pankaj Anthwal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Dhokebaaz!!!</b> Akhir nikla na tu hi ultimate dhokhebaaz... mujhe nahi le gaya farewell party pe.. jaanta hai na kis sandarbh (context) mein batiya raha hoon main?? <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Harsh Vardhan Bansal, the personality is as great as the name itself. Harsh bhai batch ke sabhi logon ka khayaal rakha karte shuru ke dinon mein. Quite a mature person, we could always depend upon him to take up responsibilities on our behalf. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>A very sensible and understanding person, it is always good to share thoughts with him. Par bhai, jab discussion debate ban jaye to fir khair nahi.. he will dig you out of your grave to make you listen to his point which more often than not you find quite valid. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Having all the qualities mentioned above, it is only natural that he takes up the biggest of responsibilities and carries them out well. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Quite intelligent and hard working, no wonders he performed well and will always keep doing so in the professional arena. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>A very serious thinker, he is quite philosophical and equally daring to back his thoughts and ideas. The last ingredient that makes him a wonderful human being is <b>sensitivity</b>.<br><br>He is one person who I always felt understood me, and from whom I would not want to hide anything. Someone, who would understand you, take care of you, he was one of those rare people for me in college. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>All in all our Harsh (Fred Flintstone) is a gem of a person and a wonderful, reliable, behasbaaz  friend <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Aur haan ye sun le... <b>Table mein koi feelings nahi hoti. Jab feelings aa jati hain, tab wo table nahi rehti. Sab tere dimaag mein khalal hai</b> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the first people I came in contact with in IIIT-H. He's very amiable person, and very helpful... helped me with many of my assignments, especially the AI assignment in which we had to make some code and I was not able to do it so I kept on bugging him till I understood what to do... he also patiently guided me through the whole thing.<br>He is quite an extrovert person and can keep on talking on anything and everything. I myself being an introvert, I enjoy the company of an extrovert and Harsh has always been a lot of useful advices, although I didn't use them.<br><img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Once he asked me to walk with him to Dhobi, but I showed reluctance on which he remarked that its not my walking with him that's important, but<br>willingness to spend sometime with my friends without being perturbed.<br>I did feel that he's overacting and playing around when he used to come to our study group when someone's teaching something the night before exam because he used to fill in some words when the person teaching hesitated. But later I<br>understood why he came to our or any study group, he himself told me that he's not able to stay in his room to study. He likes company of people so he likes studying in a group. I understood him and started liking him even more!<br>He also taught many of us GHEB waalas graphics before the end-semester exam!<br><img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And yeah, he closely resembles Fred Flintstones. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I have always found him in the forefront of campus life, organizing events, talking(chatting <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) with professors, other students, playing BB, strumming guitar (for fun), humming some music, etc. etc. as if living every bit life has to provide.<br>He also does some lively discussion and his mannerism of speaking is such that even the boring monotonous things somehow seem fresh and lively! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He gave me the nickname 'Senu'. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>What I would like to take from him is his robust speaking skills!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harsh or as I call him <i>Teddy</i> is intelligent, simple, fun-loving and nice person... He is very good in studies... Nine pointer with six IIM calls and three converted <img src=Smileys/77.gif />... He has very good leadership qualities... He is very firm on his ethics and morals <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>We did the ITWS project together... Though we couldn't achieve what we wanted to, we learnt a lot from it.... It was really fun working with you... We used to lot of BC together... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Whenever we meet... He gives me a broad smile and calls me 'Yankee' then in return I too smile and say 'Teddy' <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best for the future... Hope you make a good career in management and achieve whatever you aspire <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and Don't forget me.<br><br>Best wishes,<br><i>Yankee</i> <br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harshu, dada ye inhi naamo se jaane jaate hai.<br><br>Inke intelligence ke baare mei kya kahu. 9+ CGPA,CAT (6 calls), strand life phoda hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. BTP bhi Dr. Sangal ke saath. English aur logics ka to CAT se hi andaaza lagaya jaa sakta hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.Kisi bhi topic par aap inse discussion kar sakte hai.

Mujhe lagta hai iske 20 saal baad kaan kharab ho jaaenge ya phir iske bacchon ke ek haath mein mobile hoga jo kaan par permanent laga hi aaega <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Khurana inka priya padosi hai. Movies bhi bahut dekta hai. Ye mat sochie ki harsh khelta nahi hai. Thoda hi sahi lekin TT,Basket ball khelta hai occasionally <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.Ye mess mein to more than 60% of the times nahi khate hai. Bas subway se kaam chala leta hai.<br><br> Help karne ke lie to hamesha tatpar given ki jyaada physical mehnat na ho. Bandhe ki gaadi itne logo ne chalai ki ab woh kachre ke dibbe ki tarah sthai ho chuki hai <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. <br>keep attaining new heights and be always my good friend <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> ..<br><br><br>(hindi font kaam nahi kar rahe to ab samajh lena isi font mei)<br><br> Brikchon ki tarah bankar nishchal, apna sarvasya lutaya chal<br> Jo aaye usi ko dekar fal, thandi thandi chhaya kar<br> Dukhiyon ka khoob sahara ban, sagar ka shaant kinara ban<br> Abhichal ujjawal dhruv taara ban, sabko sadmaarg dikhaya kar<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Harsh a.k.a HVB is intelligent, sharp, quick and very good decision maker. He is highly focused. He is the only person in IIIT who can read and understand Sanskrit. (Respect) <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. A well planned guy and knows why/what/how he is doing it(the work that he takes). He loves traveling. Always spotted with his cell phone, with his neck bent (30 degrees) talking softly with someone <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Was a part of several lead roles and never backed out of any. Thanks for the lovely kurta present that you had presented to all our winges. Your mom makes amazing chocolates and I will miss them for sure.

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Harsh one of the most active students in the college. I remember him as the next roll number of Himank and I was quite amazed by the level of cheating he used to do during the exams. He and Himank used to sit one aftre the other and they cheatde like nothing else. Sometimes he used to turn completely and asking ans showing answers to Himank. I believe many of Himank's good grades are because of him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>He is very talkitive and that too quite loudly so it can be quiteirritating sometime. But this has never stopped me from talking to him because I always believed he is very kind and a nice chap. One of his best qualities is his helpful nature. You ask him for something and he will never let you down. Its really hard to find someone who thinks so much about others.<br><br>Right from the first year, he has been one of the brightest students both academically and otherwise. He has been active in all the activites during the course of out Btech. His dedication towards everything he do is really commendable and this can be justified by his CAT results. He is among those who got the maximum number of IIM calls and its really good to see that he finally converted most of them <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>I have always seen him as a good friend and will carry on the same. My only advice for him is speak a little <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>No need to say that you'll do great in your future because I believe you'll do <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Good Luck and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Thode time mein pata nahi kitne cheeze manage kar leta hai, aur phir bhi masti kar leta hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Hum kahein bhi jayen, koi bhi problem ho, harsh ko bol do aur light lo. He will manage. He is always ready to help <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Classes mein hamesha time par jaata hai aur khoob saare doubts poochta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is a very good speaker and a nice negotiator. I firmly believe that he will be very successful as a manager. While working on the rally, he gave the best from his side. Without him, it wouldn't have been possible <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Thoda alsi hai - shayad jyaada bhi hai. Par koi pareshani ho, toh phat se solve kar deta hai.

<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Bhai, bande main dimag hai. Haan ab dimag thoda tilt ho gaya hai(pata hi hoga kyon <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) par volume to utna hi hai. <br><br>He is very generous. He purchased a public conveyance for his personal use!!! He is opposite of me. He can not say "NO" to too many people  and I can not say "YES" to people I do not like. He is my argument partner. We fight a lot. Most of the time when I rebuff on some of his statement. But I think he is generous to forget and we still talk normally the next day, or the next to next day, or the next to next to next day.<br><br>Bahut hi alsi hai. No interest in walking until and unless the route is centrally air-conditioned with sub-way on either sides <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Plays no other <br>sport other than TT kyonki "SAY NO TO SWEAT", paseena aa jayega to nahana padega and that violates the first statement of paragraph.<br><br>He is good in public relations but he does not want to be a HR manager. I guess everyone of us facing the same problem It is the high time we all should start thinking what we really want to be, irrespective of what other people think about that. But I know he can do good in any profession. It is the question of 90% or 100%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

Lekin mere tit for tat wale lesson ab ise thode-thode samajh mein aane lag gaye hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Kuchh cases mein mujhse bilkul ulta hai. Jahan par physical work karne ke baat aati hai Harsh kahin par nazar nahin aata <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Lekin padhaai ke case mein banda bilkul phodu hai. Public relations kaafi achchhe hain iske. Agar kisi ko koi salaah leni ho to use Harsh ki yaad aati hai. <br><br>Kaafi hard working bhi hai. College mein isne lagbhag har tarah ki activities mein participate kiya hoga ya organize kiya hoga (physical efforts wali activities ke alava) <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Debate karne ka ise bas mauka chahiye, khaas taur se Richeek ya Khurana ke saath.

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b><i> Part 1 </b></i><br><br>First of all, I must thank Harsh for any credit he gives me for for IIM Indore. After all, he is going to pass out of the hallowed portals of IIM-B after two years <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But hell, this guy is way too good for any IIM to ignore him. So help or no help, he had to get through IIM-Indore <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><br>HVB has been consistently brilliant with anything related to academics. A nine pointer, honours, an internship in the best company around, a great job and 6 IIM calls. Hats off, brother <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I really do hope that he makes it big in the world of management, because hes very fit for the same. He has good people skills, and has good relations with a lot of people in the campus. Never the one to hold back from speaking out, he is comes across as quite frank. Besides, hes always been at the forefront when it comes to college affairs.. Ragging, campus life, cultural, felicity.. I still remember the number of events we (Chand, Sambhav, you and me) would take the initiative to organize. He was always good at doing so. But yes, he has asked me if I was not happy with his role in Felicity. Hmm.. Well, at the start of it all, I expected you to play the most important role in Felicity. You certainly did play a subtsantial role, but not of the magnitutde I expected out of you. However, no hard feelings about that- I understand that you had other priorities back then. But well, we still had our moments togther- Bharastudents, onlinerealgames <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>Harsh was the one who'd get angry at a lot of small things. However, this aspect of his has been changing, and credit to him for that. He is also a very friendly chap, whos nova is always available <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And yes, he has very little of this thing called ego, which is very useful when it comes to friendships. And that explains his large set of pals. Other memories with him include Pink Panther in City Center Calcutta, Batch trip, Freshers '06 etc.<br><br>I not only hope, but am sure that you'll make it big in life!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

He is brilliant, and you can see that from his grades. One of my first friends at IIIT-H, we were in the same mentor group and then we were neighbours for about an year. I just cannot forget each and every moment of my first semester, and without this guy that would not have been possible. <br><br>He is a hard-core Vayu-ite! If He wouldnt have pushed me I wouldn't have done all those dances and that draupadi thing in freshers ! <br><br>Cheers Bro!</b></i></ul><br><br>
