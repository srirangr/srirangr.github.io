<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>people call him 'scientist' .. I don't know how appropriate that is <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. but one thing which I've noticed by the means of conversing with him is that he has quite a unique sense of things <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>we started to talk in the 3rd semester... during the English Literature course... I've found him to be always interested in discussions be it philosophical, scientific, supernatural <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , fantasy n all <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>the story he wrote 'sleeping in the classes' was really good and it deserved to be the title for the forthcoming book of our stories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>he has always asked me about various books and movies and TV shows... I'm glad that he has read The Fountainhead on my suggestion.. and I do hope he found it very unique <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>and finally his keen sense of observation and pulling out non-stop logical PJs from trivial conversations is praise worthy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>I wish you all the success in career n life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The <b>Mux</b> I know is a person who's a keen interest in Geography, GK and almost thing which comes under general IQ <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>He's one dedicated guy when it comes to handling certain responsibility.. and he makes sure that he does his work properly and in this pursuit he often ends up disturbing and irritating others <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>I still remember him as a person who didn't know that there is a world outside Jaipur till he was 10 years old <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>He is very naive and trusts people easily which is both good and bad <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>We have participated together in DumbC, Quizs and he's always been fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I still remember our train journeys where he and I wud sit near the window with an Atlas.. and talk about geography and test each others' knowledge <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>He keeps on buzzing me asking the meaning of several 'phrases' and 'word usages' .. and I've got to learn a lot from this habit of his... for he won't give up until he has dug the history and all the possible usages of that particular 'word' or 'phrase' <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>He wears his emotions on sleeves .. You can tell from his face when he's furious (even then people usually dont take him seriously)... he often ends up making fun of himself just to make others laugh.. which is a rare quality... <br><br>He is this one good mumma's boy who wants to keep his slate clean and clear ... and never even thinks of doing anything 'socially' wrong <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>He's a CSD and still fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> what an irony <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>I wish you luck ... hope you get MS in the next year itself.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>keep in touch... cheers !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>and.... prashasti... chandigarh is the best city in our country.. you shud pay it a visit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>lets rewind.. 1st year... the reason I never really talked to her back then was  .. I've always had this feeling that she would cry the moment I say something <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. still don't know why it was so <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... I mean I've never been careful with my words with gals, and looking at fragile, lanky looks I didn't want to burden her anymore <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>But still we did talk on certain occasions <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>there was this time when shikha came to NBH to examine my new lappy.. and prashasti accompanied her.. I've always felt uneasy in her presence.. but I think I made a truce that day by offering chocos to her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>right through the 1st, 2nd years... whenever we have confronted each other.. 'sarcasm' has being there... open criticism and sheer sarcasm <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Swati wud tell me that prashasti is a real nice gal and I'd apply my logic of staying away from committed gals <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. <br><br>but all that apart.. looking at her from acads angle, sports angle ... she in one wow <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />  ... <br><br>I am not a hard core feminist .. but still it feels good to see a gal at the top <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>I am not sure if I shud say that we shud have spent some more time together <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. coz I think we wud have ended up fighting cats n dogs <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>But I can claim that you are perhaps the most sensible gal of our batch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  and keep that up and I m sure you will <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>you'll rock in ur career and life... coz you are one of those good complete package gals who know what they have to do and are very good at it... be it relations or profession <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>oye.. I just remember you are going to be in Banglore too... I just wish whenever we cross roads we can be amicable enough <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>and btw.. nice profile pic.. I just noticed <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>cheers !</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>'bacha' .. this is the word I've so much wanted to use for Ajay Somani.. and now I did <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Lets hit the backward winds... Somani of the 1st year as I remember him looked 'sadu' 'boring' 'rotlu' <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>The only incident I remember was borrowing his phone and talking a gal for about 30 minutes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. thanks dude... <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Then came the end of the 2nd year.. and that was the time when he began to become an active member of our gang.. and started joining us in our outings.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>Meanwhile I should mention (as anyone will .. about him ) ... probably the best programmer I've seen and met <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. I've seen him solving problems and typing codes as fast as giving the verbal instructions to smone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>He has this attitude of 'not caring' much about what others say or do.. he likes to be busy and involved in his own life.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>But we always pick on him whenever he is around.. and he's become sporty over time.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>The one thing I'll remember him for are all those outings to GC .... for he's always ready whenever it's about going out for food <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>I can certainly see a really bright future for him.... the only thing I want him to improve are his PR skills <img src=Smileys/1.gif />  <br>and do learn to put a smile on your face <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>cheers !!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sauravkhurana.html>Saurav Khurana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>one word which pops in mind when it comes to saurav khurana is 'padhakoo' <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I met him during the counseling session in kurukshetra... and he's looked equally sincere ever since <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>When it came to talk about ranks and results.. he asked me if I had 1st rank in State CEET.. as his was 2nd <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (I didn't sit for that exam) ..<br><br>He has been extremely focused since the very beginning.. knowing clearly what he has to do.. and his achievements showcase his dedication n hard work... <br><br>I still remember Khurana of the 2nd year, sitting in the library, reading newspaper like you read course books <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I feel kind of proud seeing two haryanvis Saurav and Manish Arora as the toppers of ECE and CSE respectively. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He has his own funda of enjoying life and having fun which is still not clear to me... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>But now as he is going to be in Banglore as well.. I hope he starts to have my kinda fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  and I start to have his kinda dedication <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>You no doubt have a very bright future... wishing you luck for ur life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>cheers !!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>And he is dramatic most of the times... I think I am a person who wears his passions and emotions on his shoulders.. I don't know whether it is good... or not... but I find it hard to pretend.. otherwise.. and I find the same quality in chand.. he has shouted at me.... we have had our differences... but that's what matters sometimes.. I mean not everyone can put 'friendship' on sake to prove a point.. and that too without really hurting you.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>I'm glad you are going to be there in Banglore.. I hope we continue on this 'friendship' of ours <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. you are always ready for fun... and we'd have tonnes of it there <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Finally, he is a live example of 'living life the way it should be lived' <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>But one thing I'd suggest and strongly urge you to ponder over is to 'quit' or at least lessen the levels of smoking <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> ... daroo fir bhi theek hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>have an awesome career and life mate !! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>this one was due from a very long time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>there are very few people whom you meet and find to be on the same level of 'thoughts' and 'mindset' as yours.. chand is one of those for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>we got to know each other from A2 group time... same english classes and lab sessions... and another thing was that he was manish's room mate.. so whenever I wud go to see manish.. he wud be there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... and he and I wud end up gossiping more than me and manish <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>with almost every other person one of the main topics of discussions has always been gals <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. but with him.. discussions wud roam around nationalism, philosophy, politics, history .. and I've never really had such intense sessions with anyone else... <br><br>everyone in the campus knows him.. and will say things which are quite obvious when it comes to him.. like being a hard working leader, getting involved in all kinds of activities that goes on around the campus... I've sometimes being awestruck at that thought 'does this guy has any personal life' ... coz he was always talking to smone about sm issue in the campus... or else people wud be after him.. to solve and sort their issues out... hats off to you.. for having such patience, stamina, and understanding power... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>he used to so busy all the time.. but still he wud come to my room regularly and we wud have night long discussions <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>there are some people who know you by how you look.. and by what you say... and then there are people who listen to you and actually read you between the lines and understand you... chand has been one such person for me... for he has always backed me on the issues (or thoughts) which I've found to even share with others .. thanks for having such a faith in my convictions... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>but in this last semester.. I started reading HP series.. finally <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. and I found it so engrossing that I encouraged him to pick it.. initially he made fun of me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (which was well deserved) .. but when he started... he finished the whole series in about 15 days... 2 days earlier than I did.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>there are so many memories.. which I'm sure I m not able to collect right now... <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>you are Bond, Genious.. after all a PPO in MS <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ^:^ <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .... everyone knows this... but the manish I know... is how I've described him above... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>And our jugalbandi still continues.. in the gym <img src=Smileys/1.gif />..

I just recalled one statement made by you... it was just in the beginning of the 3rd semester.. we were all in the BB court.. and you said sth like " agar is saal bandi nahi mili to main g** ban jaoonga" <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...

<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>But all that aside... what I am more interested in mentioning here is the change that came in his personality and life in general.. due to the success he achieved.. <br>For now it wasn't the timid, shy, not-so-outrageous kulbir... he has become the 'chacha' of 'explosive', 'devil may care attitude' ...<br>'logon ka katna', 'using non-stop and heavy expletives' comes with the description of being 'chacha' <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>'Never to give a straight answer' .. 'Never addressing anyone without adding the 'C' word before or after his name' .. he's responsible for making the 'c' word and all its forms.. so common that we find it difficult to complete even a small sentence without using it.. so careful I began to be of my words while talking to a gal ... all thanks to 'chacha' <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>But language part apart.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. lets come to chacha's nautankis..<br><br>Chacha gets drunk even by the assumed smell of 'beer' coming from a distant place.. the drama he created in Felicity 07 .. acting all drunk.. everyone got worried.. 'what happened to him' .. for he was falling all over the places.. seeking the shoulders for support... we got him a chair to sit... but he wud not give up on his nautanki.. for only I knew that he had nothing but half a can of pepsi.. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. but I still played along his drama.. he took him to his room.. and reaching there he turned his speakers to the max volume and listed all the rock songs he possibly had.. and acted to fell asleep.. but wudn't let us lower the volume.. and his roomie Ojas cudn't dare to turn the speakers off... just to prove his nautanki he slept in that deafening sound all through the night <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... <br><br>The worst sufferers were his neighbors viz. sachin and ankush.. for chacha wud list a song in his player and wud continue to play it over and over again for days at a stretch.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>He considers doing a certain task his topmost priority which other forbids him to do <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (yahan kuch kuch mera jaisa hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> let me bask in his glory too <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> )<br><br>Continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I consider myself to be the most 'animated' and the biggest 'nautanki-baaz' .. but I stand no where when it comes to 'Kulbir Saini' aka 'chacha' ... but that's only the start.. for this is going to be 'chacha exposed' big time <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <br><br>At the counseling session in July 05.. when my dad saw the name 'Kulbir Saini.. IIIT-H' .. he drew my attention to it and felt happy for obvious reasons.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>It so happened that me and my dad.... kulbir and his dad were in the same train from Delhi to Hyderabad... but it wasn't till we reached IIIT that we met.. <br>the name 'kulbir' in my native place brings to mind an image of '6 feet tall, solid build, mirror-cracking material' .. but what I saw shaking my hand was only better than a skeleton.. <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br>I felt a sudden sense of pity and superiority at the same time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ... <br>He had never used a computer before coming to IIIT. But very seldom do we see a 'curiosity' take the shape of an 'obsession' <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> .. for he was going to spend the next 12 months in workspace.. trying out 'God knows what' ... my non-techie knowledge can't do the justice of even mentioning his skill-sets <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br>Even though he was allotted a room in OBH.. he still somehow got involved in many of our outings... <br>But it wasn't until the Diwali night in the 1st year.. that we really got together.. I don't know what exactly happened... everyone else was busy having fun.. after dinner... but Kulbir and I went for a walk.. and kept on walking for a long time.. I poured my heart out to him.. told him about a certain.. gal and so so.. we went to workspace... and then he used all the skills he had acquired by that time.. to help me find out that gal.. for a long time there was an account on orkut.. under the name of 'pankaj saini' with kulbir's photo as display pic <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br>He wasn't the 'chacha' until the end of 2nd year... it was then that he kinda became quite confident of his skills.. and that confidence of him has taken him to the heights where only a few of our colleagues have reached... <br><br>Continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Favourite Memories </b> 'Godfather' in Akansh's room... so many wonderfully outings...  the look of relief on his face when he got placed <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... and of late... the discussions on his 'not-gf' <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ... <br><b>Changes that have taken place over time </b> none.. save for the fact that he's become a lil bit more patient.. and can now tolerate Ojasvi.. though only for a while <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br><b>Looking forward to </b> to an even 'wonderful' time in banglore... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>but the main thing to note here is that... whatever subject I taught <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> him.. he got more marks than I did <img src=Smileys/41.gif />  ... a thing which he wud always laugh about <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ..<br><br>then there came a time.. during the summers at the end of 3rd year.. when he became quite isolated by his own choice.. he wud hardly come out of the room.. wud hardly join us in any outing.. I thot we had lost him or something.. we tried several different tricks to get that 'boredom' or 'what it was that was eating his insides' out of him... but it was only after 1-2 months that he came back to his normal self.. and the going has got only great from that point.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>then came the 7th semester... I had my CAT.. he had nothing but placements.. we both made many a schedules to start our prep.. but I never remain true to any of those schedules.. but thankfully he did.. I was more certain of his cracking his first interview than my cracking my IIMs interview (if I got a call <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) .. and that he did prove <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ...<br><br>before I say anything else... I shud mention certain trends that we followed over the 4 years of stay here... we both have given 'food' <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  priority over anything else.. so wud like to mention the same here... in the 1st and 2nd semester it used to be 'punjabi rasoi' and 'eat street' ... then in the 2nd year.. it was any random place <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. in the 5th semester it was the endless 'ordered in' pizzas... once-twice-thrice- and at times 4 times in a week <img src=Smileys/13.gif />  .. in the 6th semester it was the 'burgers', 'hotdogs' from the 'cakes n crisps' ... in the 7th semester it was 'Ginger Court' .. used to go there so often... that I've lost the count <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>of late there has been an addition of an addiction that's 'beer' <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> wudn't elaborate on that though <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> <br><br><b>things I wud remember him for</b> endless discussions on topics as weird as the discussions themselves..... for never saying 'no' to an outing.. or walk around the campus be it at 3 or 4 in the morning <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. and the endless list of movies and TV serials we talk and fight about.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>continu</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>first impressions are not really trustworthy.. and therefore I avoid forming opinions on that basis.. Sachin was one of the few people whom I met very early in IIIT and the fact that he was a fellow-cellarian.. made sure that we got to spend a lot of time together... Sachin was there in my very first outing.. and ever since then.. it's hard to imagine any outing without him being around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... but more on that later.. let me first get to the starts..<br><br>I found him to be very lighthearted .. lighthearted to the extremes of being 'rude' and 'careless' towards 'emotions' at first... I mean as long as it was for fun.. he was always in.. but the moment the talks used to get a lil bit serious he wud be like " kyun pakka rahe ho yaar " .. I didn't like this attitude of his a lot <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> but I kept my opinions to myself... and continued to be with him in all the discussions and fun and masti... and what resulted was.... that I changed in due course... and became a lot less 'whiny'<img src=Smileys/26.gif /> .. a lot less 'senti' .. and a lot more 'cool'<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ... thanks to Sachin <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ..<br><br>It is said .. like attracts unlike.. but there have to some common 'likings' nonetheless <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. and it didn't take very to long for us to figure those out... we both were and still continue to be big time movie buffs <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. <br><br>I remember the movies we used to watch in Akansh's room in the 1st semester.. 'Godfather' tops the list.. we watched the 1st and 2nd movie back to back... even though he was sleeping half way through the second movie <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>How faithfully we were devoted to 'punjabi rasoi' in the 1st year.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. I wudn't need to ask him twice if I wanted to go out.. he wud always be there... if we didn't go out... we wud order in.. and there was a time.. when we were ordering every second day.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>He has always been an integral part of all the pranks that I thought of and implemented <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ... <br>As far as academics were concerned... he was and still is very good at 'programming' ... continued ....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>we share so many jokes.. that we don't even need to speak them out.. I mean if we are smwhr and we find ojasvi approaching.. I wud just look at ankush and he wud start giggling <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. Chacha.. wud say sth and I wud look at ankush and again we both wud laugh... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>i remember him for his strong conservative takes on how his family (i mean his wife and children wud be like <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ) ..i hope you remember those things you once said.. including the words.. " kaat daaloonga ***** ko " <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>all n all he's smone who wud just lay low.. I mean i've seen people with lesser calibre going gung-ho about what they can do.. and there he is.. always happy with the way things are.. no worries.. and no need to boss around <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>well.. he'd been part of sm pranks we've played.. i hope you remember calling that gal. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and how you came running to me when she replied <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>he never really wants to get in the mid of heat ... but when it comes to banga.. he makes an exception... he and banga shares a chemistry.. a chemistry of explosives.. I've had so much fun with him at banga's cost.. banga has never seemed to mind... but when he did... we had the most fun... <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>the most common phrases he uses are "chhod naa yaar" .. "kya karega" .. "abhi nahi yaar" .. "arey woh banga hai.." .. "arey yaar..chacha hai woh.. kyun lad raha hai us se" ... "kai nai" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>laughs a lot.. so just keep on laughing like this <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I'd ask him. "abe.. tune mere ko yeh nahi padhaya.." and he's like "kya karega... A chahiye kya tujhe..." ... and I'd say "naaaah..." ... and then he wud finally say " chhod naa... aish kar.. paas ho jayega.."  and I'd be happy go lucky <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>we used to tell him a lot .. " yeh... kaat ta bahut mast hai " <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I won't need to provide any justification if I say that Ankush is one of the few 'true and genuine BONDs' of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . But again anyone will say and write that about him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>I've known Ankush since my very first outing in Hyderabad.. we both bought so many books and notebooks.. and we roamed around hyderabad carrying that load ... feels so stupid now <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Well only a few people know that how 'techie' I used to be at least in the 1st semester.. and I wud discuss all the latest technologies with ankush... used to pay frequent visits to library.. <br>and then we found a heaven in akansh sir's room... I wud always be there.. most of times accompanied by ankush.. I wud just write a code.. and it wudn't work.. and I wud hand it over to ankush.. and he wud make it workable enough to upload it <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ... <br>we used to watch so many 'videos' at akansh sir's compu ... we used to call it our 'chitrahaar' <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. and it's only there we had our first experience of some 'rated' videos <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>he's always been around in all our outings though it was not always easy to detect his presence... he's always been the quite types when in gang.. but when he gets going.. (which he has been doing off late... pulling alok's and banga's legs) he joins the celebration wholeheartedly.. <br><br>one peculiar thing to notice about him is his attitude... and his way of presenting himself.. at first you wud find him to be a 'pretty laid back' .. 'lazy'  kinda guy... and it's true too to some extent... I mean look at the way he walks.. 'mast haathi wali chaal' <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. sleeps a lot... I mean that's what I find him doing most of the times when I knock at his door.. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>most of the people know him and appreciate him because of all the tutorials he has taken over the 3-4 years to teach almost everyone who comes to him... but let me give you the inside stories <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>he is dexter... he knows how much a particular guy needs to know.. so no point in teaching him more or complicated.. (though a nice thing <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ) .. it's happened with me a lot.. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It's really hard to realize that this four years term is finally coming to an end.. but fortunately.. we both are going to be in the same city.. for sometime at least <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. coz I've come to depend on you a lot.. there has always been an assurance... ' abe ganja hai na... woh kar lega..' .. 'abe chal ganje se poochhte hain' .. 'abe ganje ko bula lo' ... 'ganja na nahi bolega' .... <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>So you are my Mr. Dependable <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and always be the same.. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>There are so many things to be said here... like how his hair line started to recede and he used all sorts of methods to grow them back.. and finally gave up... and how we came to call him 'Ganja' .. he used to give us cold vibes at first.. when called with the above mentioned title... but now it's become so ubiquitous that we find it hard to say 'alok' and prefer to stick to 'ganja' .. 'ganje' .. 'ganjas' <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>how hard we tried to get him talking to a gal or any gal for that matter.. and how he wud chicken out at most of the occasions.. but transition was kicking in slowly and slowly.. how he declared that he wud change in this respect after the placements.. and then he got placed.. and change has certainly come... for now you can always find him chatting with gals <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and we are like ' aur ganje... achha chattiyaa rahe ho.. lage raho ' <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>there have been so many moments to cherish.. to top them all is our recent trip to Goa.. what a fun-filled time that was.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>people tell you ... you shud be like this or like that... but let me tell you one thing.. you've so many friends.. and you are liked so much only becoz of the way you are... you don't need to change anything... no improvements required... you're really doing fine.. not just fine.. you're doing gr8 ... and I for one can bet that you are going to be a success <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. <br><br>In sm other departments.. well I think it wud be better if you get married by 2011 .. you know what I mean <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>most will wish you luck in career and life.. I wish you luck in getting a 'wife' I mean 'ur wife' .. how she shud be like... we have talked about it so many times <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ... <br><br>and I wish you attend the marriages of all our other friends.. with your little chunnu munnus <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>18th July, 2005 .. I was allotted room C-9 in NBH.. and when I entered the room.. there was this guy.. sitting with his father.. when he told me he's from bihar (it was banaras actually <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) .. I told myself 'okay.. he's from Bihar.. so what' <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <br><br>But I don't know why.. I happened to open myself to him so freely.. he was the quiet types and I was quite the opposite.. I used to tell me all about how my life had been.. in school .. at home.. and he just used to listen.. I am pretty sure.. he fell asleep many a times.. during such tale-tells <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. <br><br>As with many of the people.. he was around me most of the times.. so we became very good friends... in no time... He'd always been dedicated to studies.. I know I used to study almost as much as him in the 1st sem.. but still I thot it better not to compete <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. <br><br>He was the one who trained me in all the slangs and bad words (not that I didn't know them but he helped a few of us to come out of that shelter <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) ... <br><br>During the most of first two years.. he was quite shy (not that he's not right now) but still a lot has improved.. <br><br>On one certain 'not so important' occasions.. he reveals that he liked a certain gal (not a very thoughtful thing to say <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ) and this statement of his will come to haunt him for the rest of his stay at IIIT. <br><br>I used to be reckless with relations and money.. and He used to advice and guide me many a times. though it's a different thing that I never really considered his advices worthy.. I wish I had <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. <br><br>Anyways.. coming to the second half of our tenure.. he's been around for 'fun' this time. He's become sporty. He enjoys even when the fun is coming at his cost <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> which is something we all appreciate about him. As far as studies are concerned he still has the same sincerity .. <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>I owe my placement to him. I wud bang at his door any time.. and there he wud be.. to hear out my queries and solve them.. I think he's one of the most helpful guys around.. never says 'NO' .. even to the most 'untolerable' people ... you k</b></i></ul><br><br>
