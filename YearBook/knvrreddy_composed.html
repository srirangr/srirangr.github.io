<b>For <a href=kiranm.html>Kiran matam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>    In my childhood i used to stare at the beautiful sky nd used to wish " I wish i cud wander among those clouds " .. God obliged to ma wishes nd sent me this sincere `cloud` who has been wid me for 6 years now nd last four years of ma college life wud hav been without much motivation if Kirku hadnt been around .. The sincerity nd commitment nd dedication he shows during ane work r truly commendable <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .. (deenine IIIT lo kasi antaru )..I am the direct witness of all dose nite outs he had done for Gsoc code wid Asanka (his mentor ) nd Vam ,, "Veediki entha Kasi ante first year lo bathroom lo baaga batting chesi kallu tirigi padipoyadani oka talk ".. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>     Einstein said "I think therefore i am " ..For Kirku its lyk " I over think , therefore i am a cloud " <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. He thinks deeply into ane matter nd sometimes gets lost in his own web of thoughts,, <br>          Kirku : "Re .. monna ground lo keka batting chesadra ,, vaade match ni gelipinchaadu "<br>          Goti : "Evadu be vaadu "<br>          Kirku 2 min srs gaa alochinchi <img src=Smileys/7.gif /><br>          Kirku : "Nene ra " <br>          Goti  , Ram : <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>     But this character of analysis is wat makes him stand out .. I seriously appreciate the way he shrug off the notions he had wen he came to the college nd broad mindedly adapted nd evolved .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> But all this work doesnt mean he is busy all the time .. he has ample time for the insanity v shared during all da nite outs at goutham's adda ('baathu' room) .. The common thing dat used to happen in 4th year was <br>          Kirku : "Ee ra .. em chestunnav be ?"<br>          Ram : "Khaali ee ra..Paa ..poyi baathu gaadini kelukudam"<br>          Me to Goti : "Orey elanti panicheddam ante ippati varaku evaru chesi undakudadu ,, future lo kuda evaru cheyyakudadu "<br>    Nd this way wud begin our long nites in whch v wud watch loads of insane movies , speak hours of arbit crap nd wat not ..

<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Hmm .. If u wud hav asked me one year bak whthr i wud b writin testi 4 ane girl in IIIT ma answer wud hav been an outright "No" .. But destiny had different ideas.. So consider urself lucky.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>     My first encounter wid dis gal was wen v were ES tutors under Biswas nd i had to teach her some stupid software nd judging by da look on her face i thought evrythin i was sayin went well over her head <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. but i knew how wrong i was in da internship whr she showed aawsum talent nd hardworks but only to ma annoyance cos our stupid project manager wud compare her work wid mine .. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Now logically speakin how v bcame gud friends is bcoz of these long chats during walks from CMC bak to coll (bliv me .. wen u walk wid her it seems to b a relly big walk cuz of her aawsum pace ) nd during the lunch times at CMC (da only1 who can eat longer dan me ) <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. She patiently listens to all da stupid crap i speak nd tries to give valuable advices <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.. she attempted to teach me da greatness of punctuality nd hard work during intern but it remained in da state of attempt itself (but srsly .. i tried).. the first gal i dared to ask for coffee may it b @ CMC canteen .. i srsly appreciate the strength she showed wen 'thr were stories of both of us appearin at tank bund' woven in air by some arbit guy nd i was worried if she'd burst into tears ( cos i dont knw how to ) <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .. But to my surprise she responded with courage to the statements nd later we wud make fun of these stories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .. Can nvr forget the placement party shez given to me cuz was one of da reasons ma shyness began to wither ..<br>      <br>               Now to the step of describin her which i think has been done justice in her previous testimonials.. But still i repeat nd confirm dat she is sincere in watever she does, hard working , balanced ,sensitive nd not but not da least fun-lovin ( obvi cuz u hang out wid me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) .. Does justice to her acads nd sumtyms to my acads too .. remember crypto assigns ? .. </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=pksana.html>sana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Some intelligent guy once said " Friendship is all abt sharing ur similarities and celebrating ur differences" <br>      I think diz was wat happened wid sana 'n' me .. the 4 years though v didn't concur on many things; v never let those affect our friendship .. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Coming to how it all started in the first year on the first day of my class a small guy ( who looked lyk secondary school student ) was introducing himself jovially to all the ECD bakras saying "My name is Pradeep " (now dont ask me who he is ) From dat day on he never let that enthusiasm die and carried it along for all the four years .. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Both of us form the "potti dhoni" and "mass yuvi" pair in da cricket ground and the number of times v lost is jus one less dan number of classes taken by his so called 'mentor' M.B.Srinivas in our entire semester .. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Used to play as forwards in futbal for our batch in first year but hav no idea y he quit ( naa laaga roju goals kottadam kashtam be <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).. inka park cheyyabothu bikes ni crash cheyyadam ; gantalu koddi chattin cheyyadam ; photolaki keka keka phoselu ivvadam ; item telugu movies cam prints chudadam nd hindi movies ni subtitles tho chudadam Chinna Sana vaari bulli hobbylu.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>  Sana to me is friendly to the core , active 24 X 7 , deep thinker , responsible , sincere devotee (goes to temple evry weekend) and stubborn (nobody is perfect le ra..not even Pedda Sana ) .. v ver da integral part of a so called dream team whch had the potential to reach the main stage of felicity in antakshari but 'vidhi aadina naatkamlo memu rendusarlu bali ka bakralamu ayyamu' <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> .. But v finally made it to the main stage of felicity thru our skit nd "rajni sana " & "remo reddy" again bcame a hit pair .. <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> Da moments during da skit practice ver da moments v vud lyk to savour nd cherish 4 a longtym .. (remember da 4 hr long BC in Raju's room??! ) .. <br>[contd]</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kgoutham.html>goutham</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[contd] .. and da only guy i've seen who can score two blacks in a carrom strike <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> .. concludin it an xpert gamer (ofcourse PC) , Mr. kaala chashma widout chashma (xplain da meanin to <br>sana ) , too lazy for outdoor games nd a quick learner ( a cuts endi be byk meeda trip roju ..kodaka) ..<br>           In ma 4 years i've seen him evolve into a guy who stopped talkin to me bcoz i talked some adult stuff in I year to da guy whom all adults (includin me) wud fear bcoz of his lethal counters in IV year ..<br>                  <br>    together we multiplied loads of insanity<br>    got through our acads wid dignity -- (Be a 10 ptr , be ME ..remmeber ? )<br>    nd moulded our coll life into helluva beauty<br><br>Memorabilia  : There are few memory frames in ma IIIT life whr u dont xist .. all da moments v spent smilin together ..<br>    Vil miss ya Goti ,, In all da senses of da word..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kgoutham.html>goutham</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My entry dialogue in IIIT : "Mom , I'll choose a geeky guy as a roomie so dat i'll get serious wid studies from now on" . No doubt i ended up wid Goutham as roommate da next day <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> . But blv me , he is a living xample of<br> " Luks can b deceiving " .. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><br>	The drama king . the counter master , the frank bachha ,the genius nd the Mr.talkative(next to me ofcourse) diz guy deceives u in every way ..  Whenever i want a frank opinion ,  wud b one of da first persons who comes to ma mind .. My best critic .. We complement each othr very well in pulling othrz legs .. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> (nd sometimes each othrz legs too..unity ledu be neeku ..baathu gaa. <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> ) ..Wat say Gottam ? Has got a processor so fast dat once it sets working u gotta be alert to receive da interrupts .. (sry ra .. naa super kasi form loki vellipoya ) <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> .. one of the qualities i lyk abt him is he aint hypotcritic unlike many of da guys here .. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>        He is a walking readymade guide for me during da xam tym .. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ( dude .. its high tym u accepted it) has got dis impatience nd temper attached to him ; but i dont care coz i knw how to handle dis kid @ dose tyms <img src=Smileys/5.gif />.. hmm .. v set da limits of bewarsism for da years to come by .. wanna waste tym doin absolute crap ?? ask us ,, we've got loads of xperience <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. his room is a mini size 14.5 theatre wid awsum sound effects .. had many memorable nites ( in all da rite senses ) with kiran completin da trio .. But wen he gets serious abt sumthin , hez damn serious abt da goal .. his CG (which follows Markov Gaussian random field with high variance ) ; his 700 rank in screening nd his 54 total in mains in physics (colony second ) are some of da instances to describe dis einstein JR (genius in physics) <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .. well .. together der aint any proffessor left who hadnt been commented by us and i am sure da prof wud quit teachin if he had heard dem ( kaani jawahar is an xception anuko ).. Wud be the first to support ma ideas (cant remember a movie or a trip or a party widout u Gopu ) </b></i></ul><br><br>
