<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ninja ne aur maine baith kar Cache in ke liye bahut saare qustions banaye the. Remember the "Electronics 4 u" OMG!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Buhut aage ki sochta hain .. matlab itna aage ki peeche mud kar bhi nahi dekhege <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>all the very best fr your future.<br><br>Keep rocking<br><br>Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ninja is the guru of ECE-05,06,07,08. Maine pata nahin kaun kaun se subjects isse padhe hain. Bahut hi humble aur acha insaan hai. Dil ka bahut saaf hai aur hamesha doosron ki madad ke liye tyar rahta hai.<br>Second year main iska aur subroto ka room dophar main hamara adda banta tha. Iske ghar se aanewala khana hamesha  se hi attraction raha hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>He is very enthusiastic about everthing. He plays cricket, volly ball, table tennis football and all at a decent level. Very good in mathmatics too.<br>Acha ab bahut tarif ho gayi. Another of his speciality is his interpretation power. If you are chatting with him and wants to convey your message correctly then may god help you. He will interpret everything from that chat except the correct one.Everything is probabilistic to him. His works are random processes and he himself is a random variable.<br>He believes in planning. If he is going home tomorrow at 9AM then he will leave the college at 8AM, take a bus to Mehndipatnam, drink a juice at International Juice Center, take another bus to koti, will go to karachi bakery to buy fruit biscuits and finally reach the station. Now if he misses the train then it is not his fault!!!<br>A man of priciples he is. If he thinks something is right then only he will do it no matter what everyone is saying about it.<br>All in all, he is a very good teacher. Strong in his concepts, strong in his field. Lovely walon, you are getting a diamond please do not let it shine dim.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Yuktahaar ke liye itna kaam karne ke liye award milna chahiye tha <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He is coordinator of yuktahaar for 2 years now and he due to him we are getting quality food their.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ninja...<br>A nice person, good at heart, has his own rules and regulations and follow them dedicately..Is bande ne yuktahaar ke liye bahut kaam kiya hai which is really appreciable. <br>We've never come close but still I respect him for whatever he has achieved and wish him a successful life ...<br>Best of luck dude!!!<br>may you fly higher!!<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>His determination and perseverence is awesome. I used to see him listening attentively to lectures of Signals and Systems and awe and gape in wonder!<br>When we all got screwed up in Intro to Social Choice Theory, he said to me that I should read the material sent my the professor and that he'll be doing the same and that that's the only way to pass the course. He said it can be done because he had done the same thing for PRK Rao sir's course. He had read intensively and hence got a good grade.<br>He strictly follows a particular diet and never deters from it. He believes in hard work and has helped me on an occasion by lending his utensils to me! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>During our trip to Tirupati when we were climbing stairs upto Tirumala, I got exhausted and gave up after 15 minutes, but he kept on climbing the stairs (what a stamina he has!). He also helped me feel better and resume our journey.<br>What I would like to take from him is the ability to work and not worry about the success.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ninja is one guy who has always been good to me. We used to meet in Yuktahaar during the meals and it was there that I came to know more about him. He is very soft spoken, helpful and very kind. He sticks to his ethics and its hard to make him do something whihc goes against them. I remember when people used to not pay in the mess or canteen, he always insisted on paying the appropriate amount. He used to give counter arguments and noone could argue him because everyone knew deep inside that he was right. I must admit that earlier I have also had my food in canteen without paying but this does not happen anymore and he is quite rsponsible for that. thanx a lot for making me realise my mistake.<br><br>He along with Shashank is doing a commendable job for yuktahaar mess and its their sheer dedication and hard work that its running so successfully these days. I'll always remember him as a guy who is always smiling and has been a good friend of mine throughout. Lekin bhai bohot bade frustu hain. Jidhar ladki dekhi, bas flat ho gae <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>All in all a very nice chap and buddy its always been fun talking to you. <br><br>Good luck. God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>First image of Ninja- as the guy who broke down while being ragged by seniors. We were all very surprised back then, but you have to see him and his background to see the incident in perspective. He comes from a small town and has been a soft spoken kind of a guy. It was good that he put the incident behind him and worked towards his goal. He is very good at his acads, best in ECE after Khurana.<br><br>His work in running Yuktahaar has been exemplary. I raise a toast to him for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . We've had differences, especially over the coordinator thingy, but who does not have differences? I hope we can put them behind us.<br><br>May God bless!<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vatasalgupta.html>Vatasal Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I actually first interacted with him towards the end of 2nd semester, since i used to take a lot of help from him in Data Structure Assignments (to be precise i copied them from him<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). He is a great guy, simple but too much ideological and have lots of religious rules/restrictions on him<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (I sometimes feel how will he survive with so many restrictions<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).<br>         Anyways<img src=Smileys/1.gif />, I used to study in his room in the 2nd year with few others. Well it dint help me bcoz i wasn't used to group study, so i used to get screwed up<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> everytime.<br>         He is probably the most intelligent guy in the Electronics Stream in this college and he's pretty good in mathematics, its just that his luck doesn't work sometime<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.

<b><a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Nitin aka ninja aka bai ... my dearest friend who takes care of me at every step. We met during 1st sem, I didnt remember xactly the situation, but we used to solve the C-assignments together since then our frenship began.<br>You have been with me during my good times as well as bad ones. Sometimes I became quite rude, once I slapped you, for that even today I feel very bad <img src=Smileys/20.gif />  ... later on our friendship became more stronger <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Then we both bought laptops and used to compare them by FSB, yaad rakhna tera laptop slow hai because ur lappy has less FSB compared to my laptop <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. For girls "Shaadi karne se pehle acche se 3 Rules of Nitin jarur sun lena" Jitne jhagde kiye usse kaafi jyada acche pal guzare hai tere saath. You are one of the simplest guy I hav ever met. I always used to irritate you but you never gets angry thts the best in you, actually it gives me enough freedom to irritate you more <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . Hamesha jab bhi bhook lagi, you were there, but hamesha khana cheen ke khana pada .Jab bhi assignments submit karne the, you were there <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Whenever I felt lonely, you were there. Hamesha ladkio ke peeche bhagta rehta hai, but abhi tak bachelor hi hai. Passport ke lie to ab tera signature karke le jaunga Passport office, jaldi ban jayega mera passport.

<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Its been three and half years since I know this guy. As rightly pointed out by Shashank, he is a man of principles. He has got an immense controlling ability power. He has taken all the tough courses that are available in ECE <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and scored well. Is very popular amongst the professors. Any process/task that he takes up he always looks up at the long term gain of that task/process, which I sincerly appericate about him. Hats off to his coordinating skills. The way he has run Yuktahaar undoubtly no one could match those standards. I remember the times when he used to share the problems he used to face in decision making - which were for the benefit of Yuktahaar but again opposed by some people. He has been really helpful throughout my acads and I owe a lot to him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Enough of good things about Ninja, now let me talk about the other side of Ninja.<br><br>Though he looks thin, but as far as I know he is a wanna be <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Batista. He does a lot of ramp walk in our wing. He starts opening his shirt buttons when he is at the wing entrance, walks slowly (matak matak ke chalna) and finally ends up at someone's door. Then he shows his muscles to that very unfortunate/fortunate <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> person, gives some wrestler poses and walks back to his room. I'm still trying to figure why he does that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He has got a variety of cosmetic collection - face pack, creams and what not. If you ever want to invite Ninja to a party, please inform him 30mins before you leave. (The avg time taken by Ninja to do the makeup stuff is 30mins). His room is the best hangout point in our wing. Any gossip session/movie that is meant to be screend for the entire wing has to take place in his room (rule no.1). His place has got 24hr food supply, but one has to be really very clever to find it. His flirting tricks suck big time.<br><br>Thank you for being such a wonderful friend. It was a learning experience having you as a friend. Be the same and try to bring some change in your eating habits. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Par slowly-slowly, while working for yuktahaar, I realized ninja kya hai. Now I can say with certainty - He is the person whom I respect most in IIIT and I firmly believe that a lot of people can really look upto him to find what courage really is and what does it mean by walking the talk <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He is truly and really a man of principles. His ideas, beliefs may seem outdated, but I agree with most of them.<br><br>Bhagwan kare jaldi se iska passport ban jaye, aur koi list ko satisfy karne wali mil jaye (halaki probability bahut kam hai).<br><br>Best wishes and lots of love <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

Mux ne udha di !! <br><br>Never Mind here is your testimonial again.... <br><br><br>Ninja as we call him is a simple guy with very strong principles. Emotion thode jyada hai, thodi si baatein bhi dil pe le leta hai but aise dil ka bahut saaf hai. No hard feelings for anyone. <br><br>The kind of control that he has over his eating habits is wonderful. I learned a lot from him. In fact I tried leaving my favorite part of the food that is aaaalu (potato <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) just after seeing how he has not eaten it from god knows how many years. Doesnt eat after 10 p.m and wont eat at a place where there is non-veg cooked in the same kitchen. So, because of this we are always left with very few places in hyderabad where he can eat.

<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>ECE ke bonds mein se ek naam Nitin Jain ka bhi hai. Electronics mein baaki sab jahan teer-tukke bhida kar kisi tarah number lekar aate hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, wahan par agar isne zyada question attempt kar diye ho to extra kiye huye question kaat deta hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Paper aise likhta hai ki padhne wale ko iski copy samajhne mein itna time lag jaata hoga jitne baaki sabhi copies check karne mein <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. Ise aata sab kuchh hai lekin paper ke zariye examiner ko samjha nahin pata.<br><br>Padhaai ki tarah hi yeh sports mein bhi kaafi achchha hai. Football, TT, Cricket, Volleyball sab khel leta hai aur woh bhi kaafi achchhe se <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br><br>Ek baat jo iski bahut achchhi hai woh yeh hai ki kuchh bhi ho jaye yeh rules follow karta hai <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, chahe woh iske banaye huye rules ho ya kisi aur ke banaye huye. Lekin iske rules ki wajah se hamari outing ki jagahein almost 80% se reduce ho jaati hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, but he is very adjusting hamare liye kabhi kabhi yeh akele kahin aur khane ke liye taiyar ho jaata hai. But he is fun to be with, to hum bhi kabhi kabhi adjust kar lete hain aur iski pasand ki jagah par chale jaate hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br>Iske ghar se aane wale samaan ke liye pata nahin college ke kitne log hamesha iske ehsaanmand rahenge <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Kabhi bhi kisi ko bhookh lagi ho to uska sabse pahle nishana hota hai Ninja ka room aur wahan par khane ke liye kuchh na kuchh mil hi jaata hai. Kabhi kabhi khane ka samaan dhoondhne ke liye mehnat karni padti hai but the food is worth it <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>SNR ka iske jeevan mein mahatvapoorna sthaan hai. Iske kaan se dimaag tak pahunchne wale signals itne distort ho jaate hain ki yeh apni samajh ke anusaar kisi ki baat se kuchh bhi interpret kar leta hai ya kuchh bhi sun leta hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>Abhi kuchh din se ise body banane ka shauk chadha hai aur iska kahna hai ki is ek maheene mein yeh John Abraham jaisi body bana lega. Aur aajkal iski dedication itni high hai ki isne gym jaane ke liye mujhe jagaana shuru kar diya hai. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Contd..</b><br>Vaise to apni life partner ke liye inki specifications ki list kaafi lambi hai, lekin filhaal jo bhi ladki dikh jaati hai use chhoti-chhoti aankhein kar ke ghoorna inhein kaafi pasand hai <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Aur uske baad inka excuse yeh hota hai ki inhone chashma nahin lagaya hua tha ya yeh to us ladki taraf dekh hi nahin rahe the <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><br>Iski ek kharab aadat yeh hai ki yeh har kaam last moment par karta hai. Kahin bahar jaana ho to Ninja ke liye wait karna padta hai. Naha kar aane ke baad ise taiyar hone ke liye kam se kam 15-20 minute ka time chahiye hota hai. Iske passport ke <br>kisse IIIT ke bachche bachche ki zubaan par hain <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.<br><br>All the best for your life and hope ki tujhe is baar GRE postpone na karvana pade.</b></i></ul><br><br>

Ninja, Prince of Tikamgad (Or bhi hai par yaha batane ke liye nahin <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> )<br>Sabse pahle acades, ECE main concepts isse jada kisi or ke shayad hi clear ho. Communication (jo ki hamari degree ka ek abhinn hissa hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) shayad kewal ise hi theek se samajh main ati hai, baki log to trial marte rahate hai <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Second thing is games, jitna acades main accha hai utna games main bhi sound hai. Volleyball, TT, Cricket, Football, Athletics, Carrom, Fifa, CZ or bhi na jane kaun kaun se games ek dum mast tarike se khelta hai. Mera ek sapna hai ki ise 100 Mtr ki race main haraoonga <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>Now comes BC, iska room bc karne ke liye perfect jagah hai. Kisi bhi time iske room pe log ikattha hoke BC shuru kar dete hai.<br>Ghar ka khana, yummy. Iske room par hamesha kuch na kuch ghar ka bana hua rakha hota hai bas thoda dhoondna padta hai jis main hum log perfect ho chuke hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Now a unique feature <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> of ninja.

Kya bolega, kya samjhega koi nahin janta <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> in fact wo khud bhi nahin janta <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br>By nature he is an adventure loving guy, masti karne ke liye hamesha tayar. <br>Ek iski gandi adat bhi hai. Har kam last moment par hi karta hai ( Dude sudharle is adat ko )<br>Ninja ka testimonial bina passport ke jikra kiye khatam nahin ho sakta. Aj kal IIIT main jis ko bhi passport banwana hota hai wo ninja ke pas hi ata hai jankari lene, or aisa kyoon ye batane ki jaroorat nahin hai kyoonki passport office ke jitne chakkar isne lagaye hai shayad hi kisi or ne lagaye ho, lekin phir bhi iska passport abhi tak nahin bana hai jiski wajah se GRE 2 bar postpone bhi kara chuka hai.<br><br>Best of luck buddy.

<b><a href=yogendra.html>Yogendra Umesh Itankar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><u> Ninja - my TT guru. </u><br>Pata nahi kitne hi ghante maine ninja ke room par bitaaye. Second year mein roj GHEB se NBH aaya karta tha. nitin ka bahut maal khaya hain. hamesha mana karta hai, par maal to mere pet mein jata hi hai. <br><br><b>Nitin is a selfless person.</b> He never thinks what he will get in return. Nitin's work for Yuktahaar is really commendable. I really doubt that Nitin has ever seriously prepared for examinations as you will always find him busy teaching others. <br><br>ninja bolta hai ki usne stuff dekhna band kar diya hai. But i seriously think the opposite<img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sagrawal.html>Shashank Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ninja ki jai ho...  <br><br>He is a simple, sober person. Par tayaar hone mein kam se kam ek ghanta toh lagta hi hai  <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>He is an upright person <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Par chutiyapen bhi bahut karta hai. <br><br>He is a man of principles <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Par principles kahan chale jaatein hain jab ladki dekh jati hai. <br><br>He doesn't believe in any form of discrimination. Par first year walon se pocho. <br><br>He does a laudable amount of selfless social service (through Yuktahaar). Par yuktahaar mein koi aata hai, joh sirf yuktahaar me hi khata hai. <br><br>He is looking for ladylove. Par koi list toh dekho   <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Jo bhi hai, ninja great hai. Upar wale sentences mein 'Par' ke aage jo bhi likha hai, sab maze ki liye hai (lekin thoda-thoda sach bhi hai)  <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>In first year, ninja mujhe itna pasand nahi tha. Par slowly-slowly, while working for yuktahaar, I realized ninja kya hai. Now I can say with certainty - He is the person whom I respect most in IIIT and I firmly believe that a lot of people can really look upto him to find what courage really is and what does it mean by walking the talk  <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He is truly and really a man of principles. His ideas, beliefs may seem outdated, but I agree with most of them. <br><br>Bhagwan kare jaldi se iska passport ban jaye, aur koi list ko satisfy karne wali mil jaye (halaki probability bahut kam hai). <br><br>Best wishes and lots of love   <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
