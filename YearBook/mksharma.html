<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>Banda heera hai heera.</b> I've always maintained that he's one of the most adored guys of the batch, right from the time he christened hiself as 'Mux' or 'Mux faltu'. Ver helpful and has a heart of Gold. Last year bande ne farewell mein bahu help ki thi. Because of him, we have the Juniorbook so up and running.<br><br>He has the knack of cooking up comedy from any circumstances. The way he smiles that naughty smile of his, would make you smile too. If not with him, then at him. But this is why we say that Mux is the best. Bande ki kitni bhi le lo, as long as you don't mean any harm, he's always very sporty and ready to spread smiles around.<br><br>He's always on the lookout of improving himself. Banda english awesome bolne laga hai, aur blogging bhi achchhi karta hai. Very hard-working when it comes to acads. I've seen him rise from being any other sixpointer in the first year to doing MS under Jawahar (ye baat aur hai ki baad mein BEza pasand aa gaya). But most importantly, Banda dil ka awesome hai. Hamesha sabe prem se baat karta hai. Sabko khush dekhna chahta hai. <br><br>I'll remember the discussions we've had. It's fun to talk to someone so intent on listening. I adore you, and you know that if there's anything, I'll always be there for you.<br><br><b>Memories:</b> You dancing in the Cult nite '09.<br><b>Person you resemble:</b> Mux is unique.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Manish or Mux as we all call him is among those first person whom I interacted with in the initial days of the college. I used to visit his room and most of the time I could find him worshipping and chanting some mantras. He used to worship twice daily and that too with so much dedication that he didnt even realize if someone entered his room. He used to get a call from his parents daily and back then it really amazed me because my parents called me not more than twice a week. But he always kept his mobile in his suitcase and never took it out except for the time when his parents called him.<br><br>I remember he was the only one who had the courage to tell Zulu sir when the time for the class was over and ask him doubts during the class. We used to force him to speak and he did. He has made so many portals more than anyone else that he can be awarded as the Portal Boy or our batch. His voice is quite loud and one should see him when he is excited.<br><br>We have had many train journeys together back home and college. All of them have been so much fun. I have always enjoyed his company and I'll always do. He is also staying here for some more time for his MS and I'm happy that I have some more time to spend with his wonderful chap <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>Good luck buddy for your MS and God bless you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

I can still remember his and Maglu's room used to be the first one that would come to my mind when I thought of going to somebody's room. He must have been the guy jiske sath maine sabse zyada ragging di thi, and this guy used to make even that fearful thing fun. I will always remember the astonishment and frustration on the faces of seniors when he would answer their questions <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> There were many things he would do, which forced me to burst into laughter in front of the seniors. For one, he would never watch <b>Stuff</b> saying, "aisa karna sahi nahi hai Sir <img src=Smileys/2.gif />". I still remember  the one time that he was forced to sit below the table coz he wouldnt see it or the other time he was made to go and sit below bed and he would comply all these demands by the seniors with ease.<br><br>He is the perpetual bewda of the batch, anytime you see him, iski aankhein laal hongi and even the way he behaves, it seems that he is talli <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but he doesnt drink, pakka brahmin jo thehra <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. I still remember first year mein iski apni mom se kitni gandi fati rehti thi <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. One of the awesomest thing he used to do in first year was that he would always keep his mobile inside a suitcase. Could never figure out what was the logic behind this, he would take out his mobile just once in the night when his mom would call him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>One thing he has done in IIIT is making portals, he has made portals for each and everything <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Batch tee decide karni ho, Felicity tee decide karni ho, Batch trip ki baat ho, kuch bhi decide karna ho, he would always be ready with a portal in a jiffy.<br><br>All the best for your future man, Will miss you and your antics for sure <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers!!

<b><a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>My neighbour/enemy/friend/brother/advisor. Speaks straight forward and the way he speaks is just amazing. He goes on and on and on .. and on. Over the years he has shown tremendous change in his behaviour. In the first year, every sentence of his ended with a beep sound instead of a full stop. Every person was addressed as a beep person. Then came summer holidays when he had accidentally used the beep word at home, and realized he had to cut down the usage of beeps. In second year he did nothing except for Graphics course. He created a solar system, an aircraft simulation, spun it clockwise then anti-clockwise, zoomed in and out and showed it to every person who passed by his room. <br><br>A nocturnal species. He has even put up a decent effort in learning Telugu. He can sing songs from Bommarillu and Garshanna. I had great fun watching telugu movies with him (starting with Ghajini(T)). He tried playing CS (Nick : Teri Maut) and unfortunately people read his nick properly and gave him what he deserved. Then he started played AOE and I can say he is a decent player when it comes to AOE (judging this only on the amount of shouting that you do while playing the game). <br><br>Gets agitated very easily. It was sometime during the first year and Subroto had called him 'Cheddi'. Mux was so pissed off that he went to Prof Mitra and complained about Subroto to him <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  He is very helpful (can be clearly seen from what others have written). His DB when is comes to Hindi songs is good. When we were in NBH, I remember we had a contest called NBH Idol (Of course there were only 3 participants - Me, Manish and Mahaveer). Sadly Manish was bowled out in the first round. He is so good at handling accounts that sometimes I feel he should have taken up Accounting as his career option rather than chosing Computer Science <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He had even offered me to teach me C/C++ when it came to placements and still keeps doing that. <br><br>Thanks for extending Year Book deadline <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and for being such a great friend. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>

I admire him for allowing Bharat to swap his and my laptop's hard disk to check my hard disk's status.<br>I had great time with him while watching 13B. Both of us were quite scared and were trying to scare each other by imagining various scenarios that maybe I might still be in my room and the person Mux is watching film with, is a ghost, and a vice-versa situation, etc.<br>I still remember the day when he was the first one to take the initiative and tell Jawahar sir that the class time was over.<br>I still remember his first website's homepage where he had kept a photo of Ganesh Ji.

Mohit and him made my half the day. I used to hang around in their room most of the time and gossip hours together. There was a phase in first year when every afternoon he used to call up Idea customer care center and start asking all possible and irrelevant questions to the lady and make fun out of it. Poor her, had to answer to questions like, I feel cold when i talk on phone, what do i do?<br><br>It was fun playing AGE with him. I just cannot count how many nights spent together playing AGE. If somebody wants to see him serious then catch him playing AGE against Akshay. Once he gave me a look with big red eyes, three crease over the forehead, full tensed, biting lips reason being akshay in my team <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br>There are countless more things to mention, may be some other time. <br>I am lucky to have a friend like you. Be the same.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>MUX has got a golden heart. Whatever he has in his heart he speaks out. Very funny. <br>portals banane ke liye bilkul perfect. 30 minutes you give him and tell him the specifications of the portal and it will be ready <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> !! <br>Good to have you as a friend. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Three words describe Mux the best- friendly, funny and outspoken. Its fun to listen to what hes got to say about a lot of things. And his smile.. It never leaves his face <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I still remember his outspokeness and his dialogue with Zulu in Compilers classes. They were awesome! He had the chutzpah to stand up and say what he wanted to. Mux is also very friendly and helpful. Hes the portal guy- umpteen times has he been asked to put up a portal, and hes never refused <br>the same. The yearbook included, thanks Mux <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The other memory with him is the tutorial he took for the Gandhi course, it was informative as well as hilarious. The way he taught along with his child like enthusiasm <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Mux also has a blog, which is very funny <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The piece on Maglu.. Dude, rofl at that.  <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Never knew his creativity, it should have been harnessed!<br><br>May God bless you with all the happiness!<br><br><b> Person he resembles: Vinay Pathak<br>Fav memory: Zulu's classes and his chutzpah<br>Message for him: Dont let your talents die.<br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
