<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Chand, the leader of the batch. I think he is the base behind our batch stand united, unique . Bow to you, friend, for every decisions you took for us <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Right from first year,I used to think of him as this friendly giant <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Kabhie-2 darr lagta hain ki maar dega but again lagta hain ki koi marne aayega toh uski maar lega, he is aggressive, I remember in 2nd year he came to me and said "yaar mere bhai, papa kisi ko bhi lapet lete hain , mujhe bhi kisiko maarna hain, tujhe kisi ko maarna hain toh bol, saath jaake maarenge" I was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> kya ho gya bhai ,sab normal hai. He can be always found with variety of ppl, mixes with them pretty good,right from 1st to 4th year, aisa lagta hain sab fan hain iske <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, and he also take cares of everyone. Anyway this placement season brought us more close. He always used to come to my wing and cry for placements <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ki kaise sab log written nikal rhe hain , Actually he was one of the main reason why I became so cool that time, Isko shaanth krane ke chakkar mein I realized this is not the end of life and zyada kuch fraq nahin padta, anyhow one day I heard he was selected, I was among the gang who gave him bumps he will always remember, cherry on the top was the fact that he will be in Bangalore <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Bhai, party every weekend for sure. Baki I know tu hain toh I don't have to worry a lot. Room mein kabhi toh rehta nahin hain aur mujhe bolta hain ki aata nahin <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> faltoo mein gussa ho jaata hain but still jab bhi milte hain always have a good time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Cheers dude ,for your attitude, friendly and caring nature <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Be the same, you are really gem of people <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Baki Masti to B'lore mein continue rahegi <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Caring attitude, Leadership qualities, Daroo Party<br>Most Memorable moments : - Placement Season<br>Msg for U: - Quit Smoking <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Hyper </b> active banda hain, you  can always find him arnd for BC, masti and any game u want to play. He is the reason y most of us play CZ nowadays. He is very good in CZ, I guess best among us <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Another game I enjoy playing with him is cards, banda aisi bewkofi karta hain, ki u just laugh <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> He is damn cool and friendly <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Streethawk serial ke liye bahut roya hain , but finally he got them I guess,is fan of movies and serials, hamesha DC mein bhi BC karta rehta hain. Some of his comments makes to laugh like anything. Laal badi jaldi ho jaata hain, kewal choone se hi lal ho jaata hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, Bball khelta tha pehle, but being in Vayu kabhi zyada mehnat karne ki zaroorat nahin padi <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, OBH cricket mein fodu hain although field ekdum faltoo hain but batting awesome karta hain.  Dance bhi karta hain, I remember you fresher dance, where you were in middle, surrounded by other Vayuites. TT khelta samay kafee serious rehta hain, us samay zyada BC achchi nahin lagti ise, Kul milake yeh din bhar idhar-udhar khelta rehta hain ya fir kuch dekhta rehta hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> vaise toh LTRC mein hain but abhi tak paper nahin hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Hope you will complete MS at the earliest(humare jaane ke baad kuch kaam bhi kar lena <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=himank.html>Himank Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Himank ya Bhalu , the guy next door in cellar. I remember one day I was playing lucky ali's Sunoh in very high volume, suddenly he came to my room, I thought he will  ask me to lower the voice, on the contrary he was happy and told me how much he love Lucky ali and recommended me few of his songs. Banda nhate samay hamesha gaata tha, he, alok aur shashank used to make that place unbearable. Is a fodu blogger and 200% BCBaaz, BC ke liye hamesha ready rehta hain, chahe woh mailing list mein karni ho ya fir any place. Peene ke maamle mein I don't think anyone in our batch can give him a competition <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Banda intelligent hain, means w/o much effort he manages to crack IIM, MS intern exam <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His multitasking is really admirable. Placement ke samay bhi banda har written nikalta tha, when I told him "You are selected in IVY" , his response was "abe yaar mazzak mat kar" <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif />, who does that. Highest Level of coolness yeh yaar yeh toh <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> His passion abt cricket and Sachin (Tendulkar <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) is worth mentioning. Banda knows everything abt him. I know you will be fodu in evrything you do but still best of luck for that , keep calling <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>P.S. Yaar bahut kuch tha likhne ko but abhi yaad nahin aa rha hain <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Adi, the fodu log of batch. Highly intelligent, sophisticated, passionate and a big BC bazz<img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Waise humare interaction zyadatar booze sessions mein hi hue, still he is among ppl who cares abt batch a lot. Placement ke samay toh banga aur isne itna kaam kiya hain I just have to hug you guys for all the work you have done <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Handling Jayadev,calling companies, subah 4 baje uth kar 11 baje tak rehna .... seriously hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Although he super BOND of algorithms and DS, this guy had fucked his Google interview, by not telling them the answer of "What is BST?" He is crazy abt MS, always praises there products and will fight you if you dare to utter some bad things abt the company. He is among the ppl present after felicity 3rd night. The Coffee machine dope incident still make me laugh <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the three parties I had with him, he remains cool, listens your every point, correct you nicely if you are wrong , take care of you not matter you are OUT or not <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and listens rock. Haan rock ka bada fan hain, felicity ke samay you can how much excited he was on rock night.. moshing and headbanging that night was awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All the best dude for your future in MS, hope you will be VP of MS soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Gajini, NoVirus, Arora, Jaat, Has a cool and friendly nature. Although he is the topper of our batch but is a down to earth guy. Hamesha ready rehta hain help karne ke liye. Right from 1st year he has same cool attitude but haan tab thoda zyada rota tha grades ke liye, but fod diya ladke ne . I guess he will be the gold medalist from our batch <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />  He and Pankaj always used to give stats about production of crops in Haryana , argue with Banga abt how Haryana rox and punjab sucks etc. Lately, playing VB and CZ with him is extreme fun. VB mein toh apni team mein spike karta hain , service awesome karta hain,altough we loose few games here and there, but overall fodu types ki BC ho jaati hain.CZ mein toh aisa lagta hain energybooster pi ke aaya hain, hamesha dodta rehta hain, bechare bansi ko bakra bnata hain mujhe maarne ke liye <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I enjoy playing cz these days because of you and bansi <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and lol comments <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>  Baki logon ne likh hi diya hain but I still I have to mention abt his dedication abt task he take in hand or decides to do. Recent example is of GYM, bhai sahab do-teen ghante tak lage rehte hain GYM mein <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Placement ke samay OS ka kya tute liya tha, just mindblowing, 2-3 class mein poora cover kar liya tha ki kya zaroori hain aur kya nahin. TT bhi khub khela hain iske saaath. He is good player and excellent partner for doubles <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  MS is really lucky to have you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Best of luck for your career in MS, hope you will continue to excel in every step of your life <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.<br><br><br>Lastly <br><br>for you <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Maroo, the coordinator of our grand fest. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> for all the work you had done. You were sincere, passionate, open, and like a leader carried everyone with you <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Although he lived in cellar for a year, I hardly knew him that well, apart from his characteristics like time-table <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, fodupanti, a good speaker, his passion for cricket and his worries about getting a good CG. I think this few of his characteristics has made him winner in every phase of college life. He is now popular, is friends to many and a totally dependable guy for all the batchmates. He has really made his success path. Kudos to you dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The felicity after night party was the first time we opened ourselves (whatever may be the reason <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) Since then its not just "hi" here and there , we talk often, during BC sessions, Dinner, lunch and whenever I meet him, we can always have something to talk and laugh about <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Placement walein din bhi I was chilled, mujhe lag rha tha ki network based company hain, mein kya karoonga, but this guy told me to just think that you can crack it and go for it, thanx for the support dude <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br> Apart from kharkhwal he was another fellow whom I always looked as an IIM-A guy, anyhow that was just a bad luck you didn't cleared in subject you excel but I am sure you will do great even in IIM-I or IVY, whatever you choose, best of luck for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I don't have lots of incidents to tell you but I can say there has been established a bond among us. I think it would be forever <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- During meal time BC, Daroo Party , arranging things<br>Most Memorable moments : - Felicity night <br>Msg for U: - keep up the spirit dude <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rahultenany.html>Rahul Tenany</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Raole,among sincerest and most hard working guys of the batch. He always keeps on smiling, saare photo mein almost same hi pose rehte hain iske <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> His talent was known in first few classes, he showed everyone how much he knew and how much he knows about the computers and all. I think everyone wonders how he knew so much <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> He has his computer beside mine. He keeps his damn hard like xp installation ke <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br>  Shopping freak hain, season discounts ke samay, pta nahin kitne saare kapde leta hain , he has great dressing sense <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Has special concern for his health, roz 5-6 km dhodta hain <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> even friends se bhi gentleman ki tarah baat karta hain , calmly and slowly <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Loves going out, always ready to try new things, Indijoe ki party you gave was just awesome <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Coming to movies, hamesha ask movies with happy ending, language doesn't matter for him , telugu, tamil, chinki har type ki chalti hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Salman ka bhakt hain, uski har movie ko bahut pasand karta hain <img src=Smileys/3.gif />Another thing I appreciate him for that he speaks the person in the face about what he thinks <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Thoda kanjus sa hain but apne uppar kharach kar leta hain. Ladkiyon ke mamle mein toh GOD hain , yane ki koi bhi ladki ki info. chahiye ho, just give him name, location and he will search the details <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> We are placed in the same company. During placements, although mere interview theek gaye the but I was like ki Tenany ke saamne kahan hoga mera , luckily they took both of us <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . As we are placed together I guess, we will nurture our friendship further. Will enjoy a lot there <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for:- Luckily tu mere saath rahega, so I don't have to miss u <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Most Memorable moments:- Getting placed, Indijoe treat<br>Msg for U:- Keep Jogging, kabhi-na-kabhi toh kam hoga tera size <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=saket.html>Saket Kumar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Saket, one of the few GanjaS of our batch <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . First year Yoga hall wali meeting mein main iske pass baitha tha. He was IIT 2000 somthing ranker. I thought he will be among BONDS of the batch but then First year mein A4 mein tha, tab se samajh mein aa gya tha iske agle 4 saal ke planz i.e. 24*7 no studies, only BC. Sayad hi kabhi class mein assignment kar ke aata tha, yaad bhi nahin rehta tha ladke ko <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Class mein hamesha sota rehta hain , I always use to wonder how can sleep like that in class <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> But flash ka fan hain tab se, always trying something new with that. He is the one who thought me how to chat. Although mujhe boring lagne laga but he still carries on doing that , and that to with videshi galz. Facebook walon ne toh ek baar block bhi kar diya hain for using extra resources <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Is big fan of TV serials, hamesha sayad chatting ya sitcoms hi dekhte rehta hain yeh. I can say he is cool (but yaar itna cool <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Best of luck dude for your future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One more thing I wanted to say is that ,Dude, that the day when you helped that stranger in Indira Nagar when no one is helping and what you did for Atul increased my respect for you 10 folds <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> It showed that you may be manipulative <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> but very good at heart <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>Best of luck for BoFA( or BoA or BA or whatever it is <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) . Keep planning tours, I will join if I can <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Enjoy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :-  Managing things, tours, AOE<br>Most Memorable moments : - All the tours, AOE in 4-1<br>Msg for U: -  Tell your friends what you are trying to do, otherwise may be they will misunderstand you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sanketsharma.html>Sanket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Market Sharma , Daddu is few ppl arnd whom I appreciate a lot . The way he handles any situations, agrees everyone for what he want and manage things are jst mindblowing. He can make others do anything for him <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />, he can turn the wind in his favour by his arguments <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />First year mein toh, bus ek aawaz ki der hain, and four ppl will hold him and we all start giving bumps <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Few of the AOE players of first year, resources ke alawa inse kuch umeed karna bekar hain, still plays like that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Playing with him and maglu is extra fun because of the comments and fights they have <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br>I have been in 3 tours(Sikkim, kerala and Vizag) with this chap. He makes a itinary such a way that you can't say no <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He calls everyone (who can join the tour) to his room , and there you will see 10-12 tabs of firefox. In each you will see some aswesome pics or excellent user reviews of the place. Altough I am ever In for the tour but those are in dilemma, says "yes" after this. Tour mein bhi khub mazza krate hain bhaiya. He played eunuch while coming back from kerala in train , all other  passengers were like <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. In Sikkim trip, he had possible to visit that lake and even during strike that day we enjoyed a lot. Watching videos and pics made me nostalgic <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He was very well prepared for placements , OS mein toh fodu ho gya hain ab and managed to clear the interview in first few days <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He keep encouraging everyone around and give tips to help them. He is not a player himself (reason for getting fat), and nowadays trying hard for Size 0 <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Acads mein toh pta nahin kitne profs ka kaat chuka hain, he showed distributed query on a system w/o net <img src=Smileys/13.gif /><img src=Smileys/13.gif /> and prof. gave him A. We used to leofy this person a lot and he never got agigated, always calm and have smiling face. Sorry if I crossed limit sometime <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br><br>contd...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Along with Himank, the guy next door in Cellar, the linux bond of first year. Got in touch with him mainly because of Kulbir and all those DC++ chats. He was first one to own 200Gb of harddisk, kept lots of movies with him, and always bugs him with requests <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. DC++ chats where me, kulbir and tifozi keep attacking on someone was surely fun. At one time I installed all the DC to keep msging from different nicks <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The prank u played about stuff sharing <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> really scared the hell out of many of us <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. But jab pta chla ki tune bheji thi woh mails, bahut laat marne ka mann kar rha tha. His sense of humour is superb, the funny comments here and there just make you laugh like anything. Another thing is his blog, like his room partner he was passionate about his blog. Keep posting things, and publicizing them <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Reading your posting in Google Reader is one of my favorite timepass. keep posting them <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> In acads,He has above 8 CG now . From last few sems, he has been consistently phoding in all the exams. I have seen him working, when all the lab is shouting and playing games. Hatsoff dude for your dedication  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He has also cracked two of the toughest interview Yahoo and Google intern<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I am sure you will do great in your life,and as you are in B'lore, hope we will have parties often <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>All the best for future <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Dude, hope PKR will forward your paper in all the coming conferences, hope u will complete your MS in 5 yr and replace Steve Balmer <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br>ALl the best for your future (waise tu phodu hain but still <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br>Always Keep in touch <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your funny nature, self-confidence<br>Most Memorable moments : -WDKM, Kerala trip, 4-1 AOE<br>Msg for U: - Keep smiling dude and get your MS at the earliest <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Mohit, Maglu , Magli ka pati <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, esagu ka manager .... got to know him during the course WDKM . Hamesha course ke samay sincerity se padta tha aur fir exam ke samay humein pda deta tha <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Playing AOE with him and daddu is extreme fun, the comments he makes is just awesome. He has special way of talking, hilta rehta hain , hasta rehta hain, aankhen band ho jaati hain , aur aawaz bhi ajeeb hain. I really enjoy when you say "abe roku","yeh toh rape ho rha hain" and many of your one liner which you use here and there. He is bold and straight  forward. Jisko jo bolna hain, bolna hain <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Uske face mein bol deta hain sab kuch. Another characteristic of him is his "I ROCK"  attitude <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Kuch bhi ho jaaye he never agrees that he has done anything wrong, ya fir uska katta hain , ya fir saamne wala usse zyaada achcha hain (spl. his MS buddy <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.

He is bold and seldom cares about others. <br>I would have missed my ES midsem if not for him, I don't somehow he landed up in library that day and told me that exam is in 10 mins. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> In first always used to buzz me for some horror sort of movie(only genre I hate<img src=Smileys/4.gif />) or inquiring about which movie I am watching,how is the movie, which user has it and blah-blah....<br>During Kerala Trip I got to know how I much he love shopping <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> koi bhi dukan milti thi kabra sahab pahunch jaate the inspection ke liye <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I will remember how I tried to teach you those cards game and failed miserably.

<b>For <a href=akshaysaad.html>Akshay Saad</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Saad,Jojo,new_to_game a core gamer of our batch. Always ready to play any game at any time. He is the BEST in AOE at present and CZ mein bhi top 3 mein toh hoga hi <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Always plays role of underdog in winning team, as in isne kuch hi nahin hua ho, sab apne aap haar gye ho <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/3.gif />. At first I used to think him a studious kinda guy but my perception changed completely during those CZ and AOE games in Summer. He is the one who have watched most of the Sitcoms. Big fan of HOUSE. I think he is among the few who started watching sitcom right from 1st year and still continue to do so.<br>He has carefree attitude. If he decides not to do an assignment, he not even bother to copy that from someone else.Very good in Visual basic and stuff. We have same mentor for ITWS project and as he is MATKA, we used to have ball while presenting our project. Has a very creepy smile, always his smile is enough to tell u something is cooking or someone has done some nuisance.<br><br>During placement season also, he was not at all tensed and continue to do things normal way.I hope you do great in Pegasystem and continue playing games with juniors <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.

<b>For <a href=ankits.html>Ankit Saraswat</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ankit Saraswat or Fusion, probably the most intelligent among us. Right from first sem he has shown consistency w/o much effort. Perfect 10 in first sem itself is mind-boggling <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. C assignment kitna bhi tough ho ya lengthy ho, he always completes them in 1 sitting <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Altough a 9 pointer throughout, he never studies too hard, I wonder how he manage to score that much GPA <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> may be because of his attention in class and intelligence.<br> Apart from gaming he is excellent gamer.In first year, he is the master of AOE, persian civilization mein jo haathi pe haathi bnata tha, saamne wale ki fatt jaati thi, itne haathi ek saath dekh kar. He taught me how to play AOE. Aajkal CZ mein bhi <b>fusion</b> ka aatank barkarar hain <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. <br> Been outing with him many times.

<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Atul, probably best all rounder of our batch. No one has been so expert in various field like him. Right from cultural's performances to basketball matches to playing games to academics <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He not touched these fields, he left a mark there. Been expert in most of the things he does. Have started a Band here in IIIT, not only that, he had been lead singer of that <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />  Still he is down to earth and never show off how exceptional he is<img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br>	From first year of nerdiness, for me he has grown to a bro to me. Initial year we were not that close, anyway a "hi" here and there and we discuss about my hometown. How he lived there and got beaten by some teacher <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />. In second year we watched a movie "Sixth Sense" and even after completion of movie, he was like "Kya hua movie mein" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> We came together when he shifted to 3rd floor. He was always part of outing with us. He is thorough entertainer and had great sense of humour <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Always makes you laugh with small (sometime very very cheap) jokes and actions he does. Sometimes tells you his tales(make up of his mind) of daddu,paro etc. and the way he tells it in his bagheli accent is worth listening. 6th sem, he was my project partner in WDKM, we tried hard for getiing code for that one but he ended up coding by himself <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Summer'08 ki ending mein we started playing AOE, We played many nights shouting "Gold de, Mayans bhej etc etc..". Bahut mazza aata tha. He plays like PRO in AOE with mayans civilization <img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/1.gif />Ladka is chotte gaon ka stud <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> hain. Pta nahin kitni ladkiyan isse milna chahti hain aur baatein karti hain. Always have some girl bugging him and he always want us to leave him alone at the moment<img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One thing I respect him for is his perseverance, he keeps on trying things till he masters it <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His chill attitude and cool nature is the reason of him having so many friends.

<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>4th year and specially placement season brought us much closer.We always used to discuss the tough questions with each other and shares intersting links for placement. NOT only that when we are bored or sometime read too much. We assemble together in Alok's wing and start our BC for hours. The night before Day0 of placement will well remembered , where we laughed like hell. During placement , at first he was at first not confident of hiimself, try to depend on others for his written but soon understood  he can do it and he did it. We placed on the same day <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> With him having lotzz of HR and me only one <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> Keep taking them to MacD <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> 8th sem mein hadd ho gayee.He is part of our gang for everything we do.

At that time, when we were not that close friends, but he  always has smiling face (except when someone tells him KBC <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), don't talk too much and very anxious to improve his performance.In summer'08 ,When he shifted to Cellar, we gradually started to spend more time together. He was part of our gang for everything we do. He became more regular member of BC@CS than many of us. Altough he was our client <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/4.gif /> for first few months,  and now he is a big grown monster and don't leave anyone, even Chacha <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> At that time we mostly used to discuss about his internship <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> where he was frustrated by his employers <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and how he used to watch "De taali" daily <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br><br>contd..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br> The real placement season brought us much more close. Before anything, I must say , <b>No one in our batch is well prepared for placements than him</b> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . It seemed like he had gone through whole of wiki,placement sites etc. not only he read things, he implemented most of them <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. During placement preparation , when we were solving algo question, he was "yeh toh ho jaayega", "yeh mein log(n) mein kar doonga etc..". When D-Day came, first day when no one was selected, then also he noticed that his written script was not neat than those who cleared written, he improved that and next day when he cleared his written. I was damn sure he will clear the interview round. and he did that <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . HIs support after his placement is very needed that time and he not went home and stayed here for us <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif />.Even while my interview was going on, he and PK keep encouraging me for next coming round. and chill me with a joke on HR <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ThankQ guys <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><img src=Smileys/6.gif /> The 8th sem brought us really close.  Esp. the Vaishno devi trip, where we shouted "Jai Mata Di"  like anything <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and counting roger <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and fighting for window sit in train will be the memorable incidents of trip.This sem We have taken all the courses and projects together. Altough kisi mein kuch karna nahin hota <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> still he wakes me for all the classes I intend to attend <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> We always have something to discuss while getting bored in class as have common interest of watching sitcoms esp.

I guess he must have watched most of the sitcoms atleast twice and FRIENDS uncountable times <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He remembers little incidents of that and keep bugging you with "arey jab woh hota hain ", "yaad hain ek baar" etc. Excellent memory hain bande ki.Movies mein Rocky ka die hard fan hain even his gtalk id is rockyrocks <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.He is big fan of old songs, mind you they are not classics but songs like "payalia","aaooaaa","raanaa ji","chandani" and much more <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif /><img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Keeps singing them while his daydreams <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>	I appreciate him for his truthfulnesss and how he opens up really fast. He always keep telling you his history,crushes ,school friends, how they used to fight, his tuition classes, gym etc.He is very very pessimistic person. Hamesha worst sochta hain aur rota rehta hain <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> Another thing about is, he lives like a flow chart., if this then this , else if this then this , else that etc. types ki planning karke chalta hain even for small actions. Has very valid reason for everything he does and is very expressive as in he conveys everything that he is thinking <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /><img src=Smileys/41.gif /> He goes on repeating same stuff l.

Always trying some shell scripting and other things to fool people around. Crashed hard disk of his lab PC and keep wondering for some idle PC. Because of him, many AOE games are delayed in first year <img src=Smileys/14.gif />  He was mainly known to me (that time) for sleeping in class and AOE.

Hamesha ping karta rehta tha khelne ke liye. I guess because of him, we used to play cards that much. When playing, he focuses more on whose deal is this rather than playing game.

During placement I used to bug him whenver , I struck. and he not only gives answer to that question, he tells me some other question and there superb solutions.

He is very polite and a real gentleman. We first met in front of BLN's office while waiting for room allotment, we decided to take rooms side-by-side. Luckily, we got room in Cellar. In first week we used to  play TT very often. He is very good in TT and his service was difficult to pick <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He used to go home that time also but not frequenly he used to go now . Now its like he comes to IIIT <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. In ragging time I remember when Lohiya asked me to sing the slowest song possible and asked him to do bhangra as if some fast song is playing. It was fun watching you dancing on tracks of "Duniya mein hum aaye hain" from Mother India <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. In the exam times he just goes mad. He keeps studying till he falls asleep. He hardly sleeps for 4-5 hrs in exam time, but the good thing is after that he used to teach all of us <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.In first year , if someone is pulling his leg, and you try to help him, he will always brings you down with him <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. We made the golden rule of LET him being teased. Its better him than you <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .He became so famous among us by name "Banga" that we hardly remember/know his real name. Once I got a call from an unknown number, I asked "who is this?" The person replied "Randeep", I asked "Randeep who". Reply came "are yaar banga bol rha hoon" <img src=Smileys/24.gif />.In ITWS-2 class everyone used to shout "Banga" to point out "enough for today, end this class". He was too innocent and sidha-sadha bachcha when joined IIIT (not anymore <img src=Smileys/3.gif />), I remember we were talking about some adult stuff, and this guy sitting in the corner with dictionary in his hands was checking meaning of words we were talking about <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Has a great dressing sense <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. In starting of 3rd sem he gone mad for CZ.

Used to spend all his Sunday morning in Gurudwaras.You can always here "Gurbani" whenever you pass by his room <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Coming to acads he is in top 5 of our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> altough he doesn't know how to format system till 4th sem <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He works hard for getting an "A" in the subject, by hook or crook <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Often finds a way to impress prof. by his intelligence.. When he flunged his google intern interview, he worked twice hard for his selection in MS . To me he always seems to be a Microsoft guy.It was great for us also you cleared the interview <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. The lovely MS outing  all Summer'08 was just awesome. I am sure you will have good time in MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>	His dedication and commitment could be seen in placement time.

<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ojasvi or dark-knight(as he like himself to be called) is probably the one with whom I shared everything, discuss everything about me and probably one of my best friend around.By Looking at this tall, strong ,bald guy <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, first impression you will get is that he is rough and tough kind of guy, never cares about anything, Jo mann mein aata hoga karta hoga and all that. But the minute you got to know you will know that he is totally opposite of what he looks.He is soft, polite, intelligent and have an attitude to do anything. Has a heart like kid simple and straight.<br>	I met him first at Pankaj's rum. He was extra friendly for a person meeting first time.I first thought this guy is strange <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> but then while playing TT that time we bonded. From then on I think we used to hang-out most of the time. He used to live in GHEB but often comes to cellar for BC and masti. We used to discuss the C-assignments and usually spends most of the time in lab watching movies or something. In labs also we used to sit side-by-side, complete our task at the earliest and den starts our BC there also. He thought me most of the games which I play today. Playing AOE in workspace was real fun. Playing all night and after breakfast sleeping for the day (ofcourse missing all classes <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). Whenever he plays any game or found anything new he come to our room and literally forces us to try/play this things . He sits with you teach you how to play and later plays with you to defeat you <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He has very bad memory with names and places . <br><br>Continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>After 2 years ,he used to call Banga , Ranjeet and he remembered that I am from Vizag <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. Whenever we take bus for going anywhere he is the person we looked if he is on board or not because if we If you leave somewhere he can't come home (Proof: Mehndipatnam Incident where u start walking in other direction <img src=Smileys/24.gif />). When he shifted to cellar, he used to be in our room most of the time (frustrated from loud punjabi music <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). We didn't used to spend much time since 3rd year (compared to first two yrs) but we always have some quality time spent for the BC and gaming <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.In 4th year we played many games of monopoly and AOE. He plays monopoly with a strategy and lures with many offers which you regret later. <br>	Coming to skills,He knows karate(as he told us <img src=Smileys/3.gif />), sings well, good in argument (difficult to argue with him) and acts pro in leg pulling sometimes <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.Its hard to get things accepted from him once he rejected that. Highly philosphical at times <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Used to shout all the time in discussion forum of first sem. About girls, he is very soft and considers all girls equally beautiful and charming <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His ideas about girls is very different. Like GKB he is not liked by everyone but he certainly is liked by bunch of girls <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Coming to acads, he is not hard-working but smart-working <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He knows that he want to achieve something big and works for dat.He never prepared for MS like others have done but still managed to clear the interview.For us your selection in MS is boon. In summer'08 whenever we were bored, we used to call him and within 10 mts he was there waiting for us in MS gate. We used to play that beach-volleyball ,billiards,foosball etc. for like 2-3 hrs. It was cool and very enjoyable. Congrats for converting that to full time <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <br><br>continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ojasvi.html>Ojasvi Rajpal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In movies, I guess we have very similar taste. Although there are exceptions(I still think Rocky is Just OK <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We have watched many movies together. Whenever you are watching a movie with him, he suddenly pause the movie and start explaining you the things as if you were sleeping throughout the movie <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.Fan of all those animes and animated movies. Die-hard fan of "Batman" and "Rocky". He reads batman's comics, watched all serials =, movies of batman series(both animated and otherwise). When comes to comics he is also fan of Dhruv. and he still reads the PDF version of all the Raj comics (Nagaraj, Doga etc.)<img src=Smileys/24.gif />. I think he is the one with which I played computer games in the LAN frequently for all the four years. From AOE to CZ now-a-dayz. Some games will be remembered always.He always listens to you without judging you and gives you his opinion <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . This is the reason,Whenever I feel like talking or needs a boostup I go to his room. He always cheers you up with the his happy attitude and chillax you from everything. Thanks for keep doing that <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>I wish all the best for your future in MS and hope you will find a way to pursue your lifelong goal of achieving Phd in physics which you were crying for since 1st year.  Be in touch always. Will miss you surely <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your childish activities, Long discussions , Computer Games. <br>Most Memorable moment : - V for vedentta outing, Walk while raining that night, playing Monopolies, MS outing and many more.<br>Msg for U: -  Think practical all the time and don't eat your words <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>Song for U:-  Pappu can't dance saala <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Alok or "Ganja" is  among the most helping people here in IIIT. I first met him in the zoo outing we had in first week of IIIT and we since we both are not so sidhe-sadhe like Pankaj and Ankush  at that time. We chatted while walking behind them. First he was kinda shy and introvert types but then once he knew that I am more like him. He told me classic non-veg jokes, I don't remember jokes but I do remember I laughed like hell. After than its like we used to hang hamesha. He used to teach us all the subjects in first sem, used to proxy our attendance our yoga <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, thanx 4 dat (as I didn't have to run in morning these days). He is never a fan of any computer game however we played that "jumping bird" flash game a lot. He is a dedicated bathroom singer , often chooses songs among "kala kauwa" or some rajesh khanna movie or Veer zaara "Mein yahoon hoon yaahan" <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Has a bad voice and you really want to go bathroom someother time to bath,just to avoid his awesome concert.I wonder why we not used to hang-out more often in 2nd or 3rd year <img src=Smileys/7.gif />. I guess may be because of the courses you have taken and me watching movies all the time. Altough the walk and discussion we used to have were cool and interesting. In 7th sem , the placement questions we used to solve was really interesting and fun. Your preparation for placement inspires me to study and prepare for the placement. I know the placement season for you was stressing but I always knew you will crack them in first few days and did it. I was very glad , the day, you were selected and more happy when i learnt the company is in B'lore <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. The 8th sem is kinda fun and I think we are enjoying it too max. The hang-out with gang at CS for 2-3 hrs is really entertaining . Kudos to our spirit and dedication for BC at CS <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>continued....<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>	 He is kinda cool or I say "cooldude". Like every Bihari he is hardworking,sincere and dedicated towards his acads , have a special way to teach ...... the example he take while teaching is mind-blowing <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.The helping nature of him makes him gem among people aur I say "Ladka heera hain" <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.Apart from acads, he plays Basketball, a good athelete, very creative, not  at all lazy(proof: Daily subah 5 baje gym jaata hain <img src=Smileys/41.gif />). When comes to girls , he is very soft, don't want to hurt anyone and I think he prefer simple desi girl.I hope you find such girls from Bhumihaar Brahmin community very soon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and get maried by 2010 <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> When comes to galz I know we linked you to gal here in IIIT, sorry if it hurt at you any point of time. Knowing us I hope you took everything lightly and sportingly.Lately he has started reading all types of novels from premchand to Agatha Cristie to Godfather. Not a big fan of movies tough usually watch all the hindi ones. Coming to academics I think he is among the sincere students of our batch <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Never misses classes unless he is bound to do so <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. The whole batch appreciated how you saved the trouble of coding "Ftp"  code, I guess everyone copied that code from you. For me the you taking the DWDM was realy treat. I don't have to bother about any assignments/project... "Alok hain naa" and you always does it.<img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>As you are placed in B'lore I am sure we will be in touch and hang-out as we do now or may be more often <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.I don't recall your ambition or lifelong goal but whatever it is I hope you will acheive it.Best of luck for that.<br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your helping nature, BC at your room, Your way of giving example while explaining things<br>Most Memorable moment : - Zoo outing, BC at ur rum , Golconda trip etc.<br>Msg for U: - Be more confident and Focus while you do something.<br>Song for U:- Rampur ka vasi hoon mein ramkishan hain naam <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Kulbir Saini or "Chacha" has a straight forward nature. He is geek <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> and very passionate about anything he does. From first year when he hardly knew anything about computer , he has grown to system administrator of IIIT <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  A job back then seems completely impossible for him. He used to spend hours in labs trying to learn shell, tricks to get everyone passwd <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, and all sorts of crap <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.Anytime I go to lab he is always there doing something constructive or learning something. I remember We use to finish our mid-sems in 30 mins so that we can play AOE, The feeling AOE that time was incredible <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.In first year we  were not that close. Its the second year when he shifted to cellar we became close.Playing pacman, battlefield etc. during Midsems during mid-sems was unforgettable , we used to form a queue for our chances to play these games on his system <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He has a special taste for listening songs. He not only listens but make everybody in cellar listens to the song <img src=Smileys/20.gif />. He chooses a song and loop that for almost a week or someone(Generally Ankush/Ojas) asks him to stop/change the track .From last few sems the Coffee shop has become one of the hottest destination. Its mainly because of him. At 4 almost everyone on grp gets ping from him asking abt CS and next 1 hr we spend in the CS. I guess you are getting ur cut from CS timely <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. In the recent years I guess he has acting younger , he lost his tau like moustache which he used to have, goes out more often and occasionaly tries different things. When comes to food , a yuktahar fan in IIIT, when we go out , order anything with Paneer and he will be happy. Got special love for MacD and biryanis. The "hacker Mama" you played in first yr was really cool and I think you are more of a nautanki in ur real life as well. While placement was going on you thought us those network concepts several times <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, I still have to get that right before I leave. Thanks for teaching us so calmly and thoroughly.<br><br>continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kulbirsaini.html>Kulbir Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>	 He  nature is kind of extermist. Once he decide that that I want/love this things, he loved that to core <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. He goes mad about the stuff whether it is buying domains( he has almost 10-15 domains now), or his caching business etc.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. If he hates something it is hard for you to agree him to do that stuff. Sometime that is kind of annoying <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, Has *$%$ the sysem attitude but often becomes bhiggi billi when the situation changes or someone retorts <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. It would be really funny to think how her wife will treat her <img src=Smileys/3.gif />.  Comes to movies he can watch all the hindi movies even "Saawan" <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. His comments while watching movie like "Vivaah" make you watch the movie without being bored <img src=Smileys/41.gif />.When come to girls he is liked by girl's mom rather than by girl herself. Not talks about girls often or rather not at all but I guess that's what geeks attitude. Hope you will find a geeky girl in GSOC this year <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>	The time spent with him is fun and hope it could be continued.Hope you decide quickly what you want to do. I know once you decide that there is nothing which can stop you from achieving it <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. Wish you all the best for all your future endeavour. I hope someday you will be counted among the most successful entrepreneurs.<br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your witty remarks, help when struck with geeky stuff, Biryani<br>Most Memorable moment : - Golconda trip, Paradise Outing , Movie "Mein, meri patni aur woh" , Sholay in Sh-2 and many others<br>Msg for U: - Decide your priorities and act.

<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Pankaj Saini or GKB <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> as everyone calls him is  among the most dynamic persons of out batch. I  think he is among the people who have changed a lot after coming to IIIT .<br> Mine earliest memories of him goes back to First year, Second day, when I entered Banga's room there he was sitting in his orange half-sleeves tshirt and 3/4th .. with beard like Devdas, talking in a haryanvi accent <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , I thought for a second he was our senior and ragging kabeer and banga but then Kabeer introduced me and told me that he lives in the cellar too. I think we came close while visiting that zoo with heavy loads of books <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. That outing was real fun. Initially he used to talk about how he landed up in IIIT , how he used to top in all of the Fiitjee exams with above 99% percentile ^<img src=Smileys/3.gif />^, Matrix, LOTR and seldom talk about girls. The uncountable night-outs at his room are really unforgettable. We all used to seat together to discuss and gossip about random stuffs in our life. The real victim here was Alok who has to study all the time we spend on BC.I remember the discussion abt which is more imp "Money" or "Masti" and you choose money , and we had a debt for a long time over that ,I knw the things/priorities for you have changed now.<br><br>continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>In first sem he was determined to keep his CG above 9 and go for MS abroad , I think the aim is a bit changed now <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He used to teach us ES, Physics , Maths etc altough I scored more marks than him in Maths and ES <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. At that the place we used to eat mostly was "Punjabi Rasoi", we used to go there as often we go for Dominos now a days.and we catch him for treat even for small occations like "You got more marks than me" <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> etc. He often gives us treat that time. In the second sem the frustoopna hit him real bad and a new <i>"Casanova"</i><img src=Smileys/5.gif /> took birth thereafter, He went mad about girls, he used to talk for hrs that time abt nothing but girls. <br>He is first one to have laptop in cellar, used to watch movies in his room. In past years,We used to have night-outs/walks more often.Lots of times we go for a walk and discussed things for longs hours, Loved to share and being philosphical at that time. Topics he start for discussion is very common but the points which comes out of the discussion was something you never thought of or harldy ever noticed. He started writing blogs. We always discuss, the no. of girls in his class and the relatives of his classmate who found him lovable <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Felicity'08 the hug-party was awesome. hope I could be there <img src=Smileys/20.gif />.<br>I think one of the main reason we bonded over is the that we both are movie buffs <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and love for outing anywhere/anytime. Movie Buffs bole toh sab types ki movie dekh sakte hain .... we always have something to talk about movies. For outings also he is hamesha ready . You don't have to force him to join for outing, There were many outings with him which are memorable like Little Italy, GC etc. His B'day treat at angeethi was a special day. We really enjoyed the day <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>	This person is straight forward and has a good [or I say a Kid like]  heart .<br><br>continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>	 Anything happens to him ,you can easily spot him cheering all over the cellar, writing blogs , changing his gtalk status etc. and the excitement with which he tells you the story makes you listen that , [altough sometime you know ki "Fenkh rha hain" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ].  He is having extra daring to do tasks as the hero does in the movies altough never got a real chance.	His zill for HSSM courses like English, Social enterprenur, Industry , Globla etc. is worth mentioning <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . In exam times whole of our batch (even seniors) use to come to his room for the tuition. After all that is done he repeats that for me (as I was ever late). Thanks for that <img src=Smileys/5.gif />. My BTP partner, with whom I have worked hard for completing my project.The report writing and modifying them to look good selecting font, size etc. was a great time-pass. I hope we will get atleast B. A Literary bond.Amazed by his knowledge of angrezi vocab.Ask him terms that you never heard of and get the meaning from him. He used to read novel most of the times, I think he has only three things to do read Novels, watch Movies and flirting,(Awesome way to spend life). In Dumb-c, while acting used to clap after every action he does as in clap means something <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Can't able to guess "Pearl Harbour" after my brilliant acting during house competition <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. His knowledge about places, country etc. is incredible <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. <br>	Now that he is B'lore I hope your office is nearby so that we can hang-out most of the times.I know you missed your chance in CAT this time but I am sure you will make it in coming year. Best of luck for that. Hopefully your future plan of having "Masti" 24*7 will be fulfilled <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. May god bless you bachche <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your helping nature, Your guidance and gyan , Your enormous energy to do anything.<br>Most Memorable moment : - Watching Godfather in Akansh's rum, Night-out before TOC exam, Golconda trip and many others.<br>Msg for U: - Think before act and don't disclose every details to evryone.<br>Song for U:- Bachna Ae Haseeno <br></b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>When comes to girls he is bit frustoo like many other IIITian <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Often sends friends requests/SMS to random girls and got rejected <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. Don't worry you will find your match soon <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <br>I remember you used to talk about getting into "Bell Labs" for your MS. Hope you achieve what you dreamed of.

<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The Honor of getting my first testimonial goes to My Ex-Roomie "ANKUSH" Or "Maratha Warrior"[as he call himself <img src=Smileys/10.gif />].So, It stated with my first day at IIIT-H(how can I miss that H) in front of Appaji's office I met this guy all alone and looked the same (minus the devilish smile which he has now) the simple innocent,nerdy guy <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> with spects and a file. I went to him and talked for a while , since we don't have any known friends ,we decided to take the room together, He is highly intelligent , soft spoken, ever smiling, lazy (less than me) and fun to be with. Sharing a room with him was fun, He never argues with you over silly things, infact I don't remember we ever had a fight/argument; he wakes you up for all of your classes. The special perk of being his roomie is you don't have to bother about toughest of subjects like CO, EC, OS, and Compiler etc.I wouldn't have passed even HSSMs like economics and ITS if you haven't thought me. The way he teaches it makes everything seems easy and logical <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  I remember in the second sem we used to decide that tomorrow we will miss all the classes and used to sleep upto 12 hrs at a stretch. The AOE, CZ and all those flash games we used to play was really entertaining . Fan of Animated and Hindi movies .He usually divides the film in three parts and watch them separately like they do in DD1. He must have "Ab tak chappan" in more than chappan parts <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He use to talk with someone when he is asleep and some day I remember you shouted in your dream[ that too in marathi]<img src=Smileys/24.gif />.<br>		 He is one of few 10 pointers from our batch <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. Avid follower of Slashdot, Technorati and all those tech sites. He cracked two of the hardest interview i.e. of Google and Microsoft <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Google made him wait for three long months <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, He was seen frustrated every time some1 asks him about the result. It was great day when he got the result and treat was really awesome . Loved the Party <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
