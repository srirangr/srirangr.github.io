<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=kishorepudi.html>Kishore Pudi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sometime I wonder how can some people be so good!!! He is always smiling. I spent a lot of time with him in first year. My PC was next to him and it was wonderful to have you as a neighbor. Eventually we were in the same house as well <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Your dedication towards whatever you do (downloads <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) has inspired me a lot <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Keep in touch buddy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kapilbajaj.html>Kapil Bajaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I am sorry but I can't write testimonial for you because irrespective of whatever I write, it'll not be able to justify the relationship we have developed recently. The train journey you mentioned in my testimonial is something unforgettable. Writing your testimonial will drive me crazy with emotions!!! <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=koduri.html>Gopala Krishna Koduri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This guy is one of the special kind of tech freaks I have seen till date. He is always at the front-end of the technology and at the same time, he loves and want to support his culture with honest efforts <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>I wonder if it may sound girly but this guy is kinda cute. He is always smiling. We used to talk a lot about all the tech stuff in first year. He was also my source of inspiration for getting started with linux. I don't have words to appreciate his helping nature.<br><br>Good luck !!! and yeah KEEP SMILING <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met him in 6th semester when we signed up a contract with IIIT to make a new website. From my experience, I would call him a person caught in the wrong job. I don't have words to appreciate his creativity and designing skills <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Your dedication for not attending classes is something I like the most <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I wish I were so careless. Though I tried to follow you in the last sem, I couldn't complete copy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> People may think of these as negative points, but to me these are the best assets one may have. <br><br>Your dedication for not getting into a job and starting your own company is another thing which inspires me. I hope you'll do your best and will achieve more than what you wished <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Good luck!!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ajaysomani.html>Ajay Somani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I didn't really want to write a testimonial for this person but I think its a social obligation and I have to do it. I know on reading this stuff he will surely say, "Kya C******* hai???".<br><br>This is one of the few guys who makes my life possible at IIIT. In his absence I would have very few people with whom I can share the non-social part of my life.<br><br>I met him in the first year itself as we used to spent nights in the workspace together. In the beginning phases of my life at IIIT, I was damn interested in coding and all that was due to this guy. He was a great source of inspiration for me upto 3rd semester and we used to be together almost all the time and used to spend time coding for fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> But one fine day, I realized that I can't be as good as this guy and moved on. <br><br>I am not going to list his achievements here as its a never ending list. But this guy has is damn good combination of hard work and intelligence which makes him perfect in whatever he does.<br><br>Keep in touch !!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I didn't know much about this guy in first year. All I knew was that he used to teach some stuff during mid/end sems and I used to cram whatever he said. The only interaction we had was during AOE games, outings or classes may be.<br><br>But we came really close in second year when I moved to NBH. He is damn good at studies and is damn interested in computer hardware just like me. I can't forget the times when we both used to spend hours browsing the websites like newegg looking for best hardware and finding out best value for money hardware with no money in hand <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>He is an intel fanboy and I am an AMD fanboy. Now you know what should have happened. We used to occasionally fight about which one is best. I don't know why but we have an extremely good compatibility index. He also follow all the tech news on the slashdot and similar channels. In our group, he is the only guy with whom I can talk all the tech stuff everyone.<br><br>I am not going to write about any social stuff here because all that is obvious part as he is a very good person at heart and always ready to help and what not blah blah ....<br><br>Keeping in mind the above stuff, I can surely say that this guy has a huge share in making me a tech savvy. Thanks for your support buddy!!!<br><br>As we both are in Hyderabad, I hope this tech talks will continue over the weekends <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I met this guy for the first time in workspace. The first real encounter was when he stole RAM from my PC. But instead of shouting at him (which I would have done under normal circumstances), I became friends with him and WE started stealing RAM together <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It was one of the coolest venture I entered into in first year <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Slowly I came to know that he is damn good at Linux stuff. One of my very first inspirations to use linux comes from this guy. He would run around in workspace with a screw driver and open PCs randomly to exchange parts. I learnt tons of stuff about hardware/software from this guy in first year. I felt like a blessed one to have this guy as my batch-mate. I rarely feel bad about my crappy English and this is one of those moments. I wish I had access to all the +ve adjectives in this world and I could have used all of them for this guy <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <br><br>Unfortunately we didn't talk much after first year, but he is still one of the few people I admire at IIIT. <br><br>Keep in touch.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akshaysaad.html>Akshay Saad</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I sometime call him Saabu (comic character) because he walks like him. His dedication for playing games is something you can easily get inspired from. He is the best in Counter Strike among friends. Kamina sala apne partners ko maar kar phir sare enemies bhi maar deta hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He is always nice to you irrespective of the mood. You rarely see a combination of decency and such a huge body structure. Logon ki lene mein bhi maahir hai. Coffee shop par dude ra ki leta hai to koi kuchh nahin bol pata <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I didn't spent a lot of time with this guy but from a very few conversations we had, I found this guy really down to earth. He is loyal to whatever he does and respects others' views at the same time. He is the only guy around whose dedication towards M$ inspires me <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  I need not say anything about his love/craziness for rock because everybody knows it <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I remember the incident when he scolded me over the mailing list for my insensible comments. I felt terrible about that incident. Why in God's name I will hurt a person like him <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <br><br><b>Thing I like about you:</b> You love for M$.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This guy has always inspired me to work hard and be focused on whatever you do. His quest for achieving excellence in every field of life and dedication towards sports is something which I don't see in anyone else around. I also like his commitment to improve the system in which he lives and to encourage others to work for the same. The way his presents his arguments without any fear in mind is something I want to learn. Though we had very few conversations, I enjoyed every single moment of it.<br><br>Good luck for your future.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Apart from girl stuff, his passion about reading novels and watching movies is something that inspires me. He spent a lot of money buying novels just for the heck of it ( i mean reading <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Everytime you enter his room, you'll find him with a new novel. The librarian is scared of him because this guy makes him search (manually) the entire library for crazy books <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <br><br>He is a good guy when it comes to BC. In past if we attack him, he used to revolt strongly. Slowly he got used to it on seeing other's situation <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He has been a active member of our BC group since the beginning and recently we have been exploring so many places.<br><br><b>Memorable Moment :-</b> When we got the job at the same time in the same company <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><b>Advice :-</b> Stay calm <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pankajsaini.html>Pankaj Saini</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ye to apna saini bhai hai, to soch raha hoon ki jyada nahin bajaunga <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I met him on first day itself. I wanted to be his room partner but this IIIT system didn't allow me! He never lived away from home before coming to IIIT. He was a kid who didn't know how this world works!!! He used to get excited even over small things. The only words he knew in first few months were "Daring", "Adventurous". We didn't spend much time together in the first semester as we were in different hostels. He was an intelligent guy (AIEEE 440) and used to talk about getting into Stanford or MIT on lunch tables etc. Those things used to scare me a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> So, I maintained some distance. <br><br>Aisa lagta hai ki main senti ho gaya hoon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> After first semester he realized that Stanford is a big thing and stopped talking about studies. We eventually started doing more BC. The real interaction started in 3rd semester when I moved to NBH. I came to know about his uncountable girl friends and friends who were girls and girls who were not friends and ... WHAT THE HELL!!!! How many girls do you know <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> And how are we supposed to remember the details of your romance with each and every one of them and especially when a lot of them share a common name <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Mind boggling moments they were. His girl friends used to die and somehow via re-incarnation they met each other and had stuff and then she died again <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> For a guy like me, it was totally disastrous. I didn't know what to say at what moment. And I might have hurt him several times because I couldn't judge the occasion <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Someday somebody during a BC session coined the name "God Ka Bachcha". I was so happy that day. After that I need not remember the details of his female friends because every girl belonged to him and had a crush on him. So we just need to nod whenever he said something which contained few regex like *girl* *bandi* *line de rahi hai* <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Will Miss U for :-</b>  AOE in 1st sem, Downloading in 3rd sem, Pizzas in 5th sem, Biryani in 4 Seasons & Alpha <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and BC throughout btech!!!<br><b>Wish for U :-</b> Your childhood dream of becoming an Entrepreneur comes true very soon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>His passion about movies is unmatchable. He will watch any movie coming his way while browsing file lists on dc. He can watch resident evil in telugu in a theater <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> I also remember him watching a very low quality (100MB print meant for mobile phones) print of Dhoom 2 on his PC because no other print was available. He might have watch more than a thousand movies while in IIIT. His knowledge about movies is also something that fascinates me. Even if you describe a frame from some movie, he would tell the name and start telling the pros and cons of watching that movie. <br><br>But sometime he may go crazy for watching some really bad movies. He forced me to watch "Main Meri Patni Aur Woh" in Prasads <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> He made me watch "Pirates - Dead Man's Chest" in IMAX and I never watched a movie in theater after that till date :| I think there is some bad chemistry between me, sachin, movies and theaters. We could never watch a good movie in theater together <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Recently we went to watch "Gulaal" and the show was canceled <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />  Anyways it turned out to be good for me. Saved all those bucks and tons of time <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>In summer of 2nd year, something happened to him. He was totally underground. He didn't talk to anyone and never came out of him room in our presence <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> We used to tease him sometime for the same <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We didn't really talk for another semester.<br><br>Then we again came closer in 5th semester when I went crazy for Pizza!!! Thanks to him for supporting me all through my craziness. I forced him to order pizza along with me upto thrice a week <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> I will never forget all his support for my coffee shop craziness and my insane motivation for going out to do BC. He was always ready for it irrespective of the time.<br><br>Though he is a Baniya or Marvadi, he is damn bad at maths <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> shame shame!!! <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Whenever we return from any outing, I never asked him to do all the maths. And whenever he did it, he screwed it up <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I don't really know how to start this but I think we met really lately in the first semester. Our real interaction started with all those god damn AOE sessions. He plays AOE really well <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I always wanted to be in his team. We bunked classes, finished mid sem exams in less than 20minutes to get back to workspace to play AOE <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> In first year I envied him for having 20GB HDD in his machine <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Then in 3rd semester I moved to NBH cellar in a room next to him. So we were next door neighbors. That was the time when we started downloading things from rapidshare/megashare etc. His dedication towards downloading was something I never saw <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> He used to stay up all night so that he can download at higher speeds in the early morning. He never gave up even if the download stopped at 99% <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I followed him and stopped using linux. Used windows for the whole semester and we downloaded tons of movies <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I remember the times when we used to ping Sandeep Saini and beg for a rapidshare premium account so that we can download more <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <br><br>Apart from downloading, I enjoyed playing PACMAN with him. Yes!!! PACMAN!! And that too at full volume. quak quak quak quak and the entire cellar frustrated about the crazy noise <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> He was damn good at playing counter strike also. But the thing he was bad at was ECONOMICS. He'll never forget that course he took with me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> I remember all times when he used to get frustrated about it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Sharing all these interests, we used to hang out a lot at coffee shop and other places in IIIT. <br><br>continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
