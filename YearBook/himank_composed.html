<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=chirag.html>Chirag Nahar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Chirag aka Chika</u><br><br>Back in first year, I knew him as the roomie of Pagare, he wasnt one of those guys who would go and interact with a lot of people. He has always been the silent assasin types, you gotta admire him for his leofying skills, bas beech mein 1 line bolega banda and usse doosre bande ki gandi mar jati hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> One of the wittiest people around. He is one person everybody's scared of <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>He is one person who hasnt changed a bit since coming to IIIT, his life has been so constant these years that at times I feel if he doesnt get bored by this monotonicity. But I guess he's like that only!! One thing about him is that he doesnt open up, I dunno what it is with him that he has rarely opened up :| This has been a hot topic of discussion many times <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> though no one has been able to come out with a theory as to why it is so <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>A fellow cricket enthusiast, He, Pappu, Maroo and me form the core group <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> we hav had so much fun watching all those cricket matches and discussing about them. All those evenings we spent in the swimming pool discussing cricket and forgetting all about swimming <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Those were awesome times. <br><br>The night at club 8 jab humne sare waiters ki mother sister united kar di thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> It was so much fun that way, one of my best drinking memories <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Writing this testimonial feeling so sad that You got your joining in Pune instead of Hyd, it would have been hell lot fun with you being here <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best with just a hope that you would be more extrovert from now on. Life's too small to bottle up things!!<br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..<br><br>PS: Wishlist to awesome rakhi hai be <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vibhavvinet.html>Vibhav</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Vibhav aka Bon aka Bachha</u><br><br>This guy is one of the biggest achiever of the batch.. GE ki funding, papers published and cited by bade log. Ofcourse his grit and dedication has brought him here.I still remember once I saw him in front of motorola, he had been slogging a lot and his eyes looked all hazed and he seemed so lost that he wouldnt even recognize me. It was only when I called him that he realised it was me <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Sangal sir always says about Jeevan Vidya and bonding while we have always been in favour of sutta n daroo being the bonding factors. With him, its been cigs which have bonded us a lot. He being the only guy in our group who would share a smoke with me, we would so many times go and have a cigaratte and some of those walks have been real memorable. It always feels nice to know that you are important enough to a person that he would share the most intimate things in his life and I am so lucky to have been able to don this role for him. Thanks a lot for being so nice man.<br><br>He is one of those guys who tend to be so concerned about others, at times when I would sustain some minor injury, he would look so concerned and all. It becomes so strange, if I look at that minor niggle which i might have suffered just to know kya hua, he would look at it with more interest and concern, that's why I would just leave it off to later until he is gone. <br><br>I have always enjoyed beating him, the sounds that he make, really worth it <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramanjain.html>Raman Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Raman bhai</u><br><br>One the most favourite person of mine in our group and batch. We have never been the closest of friends ever but he has always been very close to my heart. He is one of the people who I would miss a lot once I graduate out of this effing place <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> He is always frustrated by the fact that jab bhi milta hai marta rehta hun isko but pata nahin kyun itna zyada maza ata hai isko marne mein <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <br>Bande ki harkaton ke bare mein to kya hi bolna, har din koi na koi naya kand <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Is bande ke upar to ek cartoon strip ban sakti hai. Raman bhai will miss you all these antics <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All my life will remember this blank face more than any of the most b'ful faces I have laid my eyes on <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and your style of greeting me <b>Bhalu ki Jai Ho</b><br>Always remain as you are, Its been such a pleasure to have you in my life always remain there for me. Bahut zyada miss karunga mere bhai tujhe <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> Thankfully tu dulla hai nahin to it would have been a void large as a crater in my life. Aate rehna bhai humare ghar pe <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Luv u Raman Bhai <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br><b>Song for you : Main Aisa kyun hun</b><br><br>Sorry for such a time pass testi.. Someday!! (Will always remember your love for MLTR <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) Someday I will write another one <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=piyushnigam.html>Piyush</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Piyush aka Mota aka Mamme</u><br><br>We didnt interact too much in the beginning and I was quite averse to the idea of having him in TB but he wa quite close friends to many so he came and from there, it came to the extent that I was very pissed when Manish took the room in our wing which he was supposed to occupy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The guy is senti to the core, always caring about his friends <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>I will always remember that incident in front of library in 1st yr when I after talking to sumbdy was quite frustrated and kicked something which was lying on the road, he (along with others) was coming from somewhere and when the banda saw me like this, he woulnt leave me at all and did his best to console me. Banda sala mujhe pakad ke baith gaya tha. Will miss all these things now on <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Another memorable thing would be the time when he cried on my shoulders after his placement.. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Ofcourse how can I forget mentioning that he goes on dates to temple <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Gajab senti banda hai yaar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Never seen anybody more senti than me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Will miss you a lot man <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sorry for not writing a proper one, will surely write a gud one for you <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Aksay aka Ganja aka RBC aka Stud aka Loverboy aka Shrikant</u><br><br>Ganja bhai used to be my frustration partner in first year, when both of us used to crib about our roomies who used to frustrate us a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One of my closest friend in IIIT. We were quite the closest friends in first year. All those long walks of campus we used to undertake, those were just awesome. I will never be able to forget all those things. We sort of drifted apart later due to various factors, still being close friends but not the friends we were back in 1st year. But ab to sath mein flat le rahe hain, its gonna be one hell of a time we are gonna spend <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Sorry for not being able to write a proper one. I promise I will write one for you <br><br><b>Song for you : Hum hain seedhe sadhe Aksay Aksay</b></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pksingh.html>Prashant Singh</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>PK aka Roomie</u><br><br>He was the first person with whom I did BC, back when I didnt know about the existence of the word <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Will always remember  that train journey while coming to IIIT for the first time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Hum logon ne raat bhar BC ki thi. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Its always so nice being with him, dunno bande mein aisa kya hai, jab bhi baat hoti hai ekdum alag hi comfort level aata hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He must be the guy who knows the most about my kisse. He freaking knows about each and every girl in my life and all the related incidents <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Hamesha dil khol ke baat hoti hai apni. He was the first close friend of mine in IIIT after all roomie tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Later on, we sort of drifted apart but even then jab bhi baat hoti hai, its always like the days of yore. Even recently, when we were talking about a date of mine which I cancelled for some reason, he was one person jisko batane mein mujhe bilkul bhi odd nahin lag raha tha. Although would have felt a bit strange talking about it to anybody else <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Luv you man <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>And please khud ko aur room ko thoda kam badbudar rakha kar <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Time ki kami.. will write an achha sa testi for u later <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Vipul aka Budhha aka Bahu aka Rangeen Budhha aka Pagal Kutta</u><br><br>Vipul... Dunno how, when and where to start writing his testimonial. He is the guy who has been my friend for the longest time. With some other people, we started late, with some others lost a bit of touch some time later. BUT this guy has been amongst my closest friends right from the word go and still is my closest chum <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Thanks a lot buddy for being there for me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> a factor for this friendship being that he has always lived close to me, first two years in cellar and then in the same wing in the alternate rooms in the last 2 years.<br><br>I think I must have been the first guy who interacted with him, he was a shy guy back then, who wouldnt talk to anybody but since we were together in section B2 so he started inteacting with me a bit coz we had to go together to the classes and this is when I started depending on him, he would always be the person I would entrust with my notebooks and all (he was quite a sincere guy then) and I was prone to losing my notebooks if we ever stopped at coffee shop or any other place while coming back from classes. He has always been the goto guy for almost our whole group, back in first and second year, almost the whole cellar would wear his shirts coz he was the only one who would always wash his clothes while humare clothes gande pade rehte the.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>If you look at Vipul in 1st year and now, you will realise that he is the person who has changed the most n these 4 years, there has been a complete reversal in his nature, and I would like to take the credit for being the person to bring about this change in him, am pleased to see the change in him. The change has meant that he has started to enjoy life as it is meant to be instead of being cuckooned in his shell. He has always wanted to enjoy his life but his shy nature and some inhibitions that he had, meant that he wasnt able to gel so well with the group and was left out as a result. Even though he was the roomie of Raman, but he was a late joinee to the group coz till that time, it was only me who interacted with him, even Raman, his roomie wasnt too much in favour of having him in the group. But slowly and slowly he started getting comfortable and started interacting with people around. Although he became a member of TB but I would say that he became a member of the group in the real sense only after we shifted to OBH.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>It has been a joyride since we came to OBH, these two years will definitely count as my best, the amount of BC and the fun we had in the last 3 years has been almost infinite, will always cherish all the BC we have done over these years <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> It will be the most unforgettable part of my life <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of the most awesome thing among these is the way he <b>leofies</b> Chand. He almost treats him like a dog, and almost always Chand never has the answer to his rebukes and sarcasm, bechara bas chup hoke nikal leta hai. There is an interesting concept in our wing, there is a circle of leofying in our wing. The cicle would be something like this<br>Vipul->Chand->Himank->Manish->Maroo->Vipul. (Mathur unfortunately is easy target and kisi ki nahin le pata <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>Each person has his own nemesis in the wing as well his victim. Its been loads of fun doing all this BC. Will reminisce all these memories fondly once we are out of here <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The guy is senti to the core, he must be one of the most senti guy I have met and yet he never goes overboard when it comes to displaying his sentiness. It never is irritating or anything. The awesomest part about his sentiness comes out when he drinks, its a cryathon then, whenever he is quite out, it almost always turns into a crying session. I will always remember the first time we drank in his room, all the BC he did, it was just awesome <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, wont go too much into details coz of the lack of time but we all will remember it for long time <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>Since time immemorial, he has been my secret keeper, he would always be the first person who I would go to whenever I had to tell anything. Right from the beginning I found some strange type of confidence and relief whenever I talked to him. He was the first person to know THE secret, thanks a lot for always being there for me. I know if it hadnt been you at that time, my life would have been frustrating as hell. I dont think I would have managed to bear that alone. I don't think I will ever be able to repay you for the support you provided me back then. Although the suggestions you gave me were rubbish  <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but the fact that you were there for me and I could talk to you about it was the sole thing which helped me carry on, without getting bogged down by the weight of the issue. Again and again I would say Thanks a lot buddy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>One thing about him is that, being senti, he takes to things a little too seriously at times, which means that he can get hurt even over trifling issues, at times you need to be careful over where you are treading when he is concerned. Though he has gone easy on this thing in recent past, but I feel that he needs to improve a bit on this aspect. Another negative thing with him is that at times, he becomes too dependent and reliant on a single friend and can at times start ignoring other people, which is never gonna bode well for him. Dude you seriously need to work on these issues and you will be the most perfect friend anybody can ever have, coz all other things about you are just too awesome. He is one of the most selfless guy I have ever met in my life, saying that the whole TB has survived through their B.Tech using his stuff would just be an understatement. He is always ready to help you out whatever the situation be, and whatever your need.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vipulmittal.html>Vipul Mittal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 5]</b><br><br>His room is the most comfortable and friendly in whole of UG2k5, Back in the first 2 years, almost everybody in the whole cellar used to come to his room and sleep in his room. His room is the cleanest I have seen of any guy, I am not sure if even girls can manage such clean rooms <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> If his was the sleeping room in cellar, then it became the BC room after coming to OBH, taking the title away from NBH-47. There have been countless BC sessions in his room. Almost everytime there is BC in a room in OBH. Its his room which is chosen for the purpose.<br><br>He is a gem of a guy, I think this adjective is very often used incorrectly but this guy truly deserves the honour of being called that, I have never EVER met a guy as sweet and nice as him. Right from the word go, I have been a fan of his nature. And now after spending 4 years with you, I am indebted to you, I never could have had such a great life in this college if not for you. I know you are a bit chu**atic at times but you are the best chu**iya I have ever had the chance to meet in my life. I know I am getting repititive but I could go on thanking you on and on and yet it wouldnt be enough to show my gratitude to you.<br><br>I could keep writing and this tale will never finish, he is the person with whom I have spent the maximum time in IIIT but since there's a deadline to meet and time is one commodity which is very rare right now. But you know that what you mean to me, any piece of testimonial or anything can never ever come close to describing what you mean to me. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />  Love you man!!! Will miss you a lot, you have been an integral part of my college life, cant imagine my life sans you in the college.<br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future... Hoping that we will always be in touch, life would be so incomplete without you.<br><br><b>Most Memorable Moment: I can never point out anything but if I had to say one thing then it would be the time when we shared those text files (hope u remember ) btw i lost the files, need them :|</b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep Rocking..</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Pagare aka Pappu aka Bhopali</u><br><br>As far back as I can remember, he has always been called Pagare, which has recntly changed to Pappu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> One of the most famous and dynamic guys of the batch. This Bhopali has always been the star of our batch, ranging from the seniors to the super seniors to the juniors and super juniors, he must be one of the most popular guys of the batch when it comes to people from other batches, each and everybody in the college knows this stud. An awesome dancer, Best bowler in IIIT (the guy represented MP long long time ago). An self confessed introvert and fattu when it comes to talking to girls, he has imporved quite dramatically as the years have progressed, from being a guy who was shy even to say an <b>Excuse Me</b>, right now he has lot of (girl) friends and some special friends. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Has an unusual capacity for BC, always ready for a session or two <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> which resulted in his ( and Cheeka's) room, the famous Room Number <b>47</b> becoming the BC hub for our group. It was a meeting place for us cellarites, ppl from 1st floor and Maroo (2nd floor). The number of hillarious, emotional, memorable moments we had in that room is just uncountable. That was and will always be remembered as the <b>BC room </b>of our group. Infinite amount of BC has happened in that 10X10 tract of land in NBH. Oh! those lovely memories <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>He is the cute kid of our group, a concept developed and popularized by Chand. His performances of <b>Twinkle twinkle and Machhli jal ki rani</b> count as one of the most hilarious things <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Has to suffer all the <b>puchhi</b> sessions. I am amazed as to how he handles those sessions by Chand, when even I as an overlooker get frustrated <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> the only reason which I can think of is, he also likes the puchhi sessions <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>One incident of him which I would never be able to forget is the fa**ing incident in Vipul's room, the torture that we had to bear that day is almost incomparable and to add more misery to it, this thing happened twice. Our whole wing was smelling so bad for some time that even I sitting 2 rooms away from the spot of action couldnt bear the trauma. I dunno how Vipul bore the hardship.<br><br>I will be forever grateful to the guy for introducing us to the wonderful thing called <b>Booze</b>, he was the real booze master of our group who slowly made all of us his allies, leaving just Manish as the non bewda amongst us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> We have had few of the most memorable moments boozing away to glory in NBH, when he would come up with all sort of games and lists (some of them quite embarassing) after being talli. He was our official bartender making all our drinks whenever we had anything to drink in our rooms. Will sorely miss this guy when we have booze sessions now on. From being the pioneer of boozing, he has become an infrequent drinker these days, giving such sessions a miss quite a few times.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>There is more to his creative side than the dancing talent about which almost everybody knows in the college. He is also a poet par excellence, would love to quote one of the lines written by him here <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> :<br><b><i>"Today I sit waiting for a kiss<br>Oh, am I that pissed"</i></b><br><br>I cant even try to express the enjoyment I had when I saw this couplet written in one of his notebooks, and to date he still doesnt admit that this is his own creation, Modesty I will say.<br><br>He has always (until quite recently) been my frustu partner, both of us would have lengthy discourses sharing our frustrations on being still single and would keep looking for reasons why we were still single (and ready to mingle <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We always cursed others in our group because they wouldnt get frustrated over the lack of THE girl in their lives. Almost all the booze parties until our 3rd year or so would solely concentrate on the topic of girls. Ofcourse rest of the people got bored by then and banned this topic from booze conversations. Most memorable of our frustu talks would be the one we had on the eve of Mathur's bday when we went to Suraj, that was the time when I divulged THE secret to him, since then our friendship has reached a different dimension. I will always remember all the times when I used to go to his room when I was frustrated and wanted to talk about our fav topic <b>"Girls in our lives"</b> and we would both console each other and advise the other on the things that the other should do to relieve himself of the domain of singledom.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>And ofcourse how can I ever forget the great <b>Cold War</b>, we had in our 3rd and 4th semesters <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All of a sudden he just stopped talking to me for reasons unknown to me, leaving me puzzled as to what could have been the cause of such a behaviour, and the dumbass that he was, he never told me that he was angry with me for such and such things. Gotta say that it was the lowest trough in our relation. I almost started hating him that time to the extent that it wasnt possible for both of us to even study in a group.It was only sometime in 4th sem when Maroo, Chand and others intervened to sort out our differences that I came to know the reason for his anger. Thankfully that trough was overcome and we became friends again. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The coding session we had in the teaching lab 210 would be one that I wont forget easily, that one particular chat must have lifted my morale more than many other achievements I have had all these years. Back in 1st year, I used to do my C assignments on the first day itself and gained some reputation for it. This guy was quite impressed with my coding prowesss, so this happened that both of us were sitting on adjacent systems and the guy started praising me and praise he did. He just kept saying that you are this, you are that, blah blah. He went on to say that I shouldnt have been here in IIIT instead I deserved IIT-Bombay. Gotta say that <b>fool ke kuppa</b> hona would be an understatement to describe my state at that time. Never in my life have I been praised this much. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Will always remember that convo we had that time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 5]</b><br><br>He has always been one person who I always wanted to have as one of my closest friend, I dunno what it was in him that made me feel so, may be the childish innocence, the jovial nature, the BC he did. In the first 3 years,we were friends, quite good friends but not the close friends that I always wanted us to be, thankfully in the 4th year, our tie became stronger and right now I would rate him among my closest friends in college, and I am glad to know that he also considers me as a close enough friend.<br><br>There are so many things which I dont seem to remember right now, after all writing out 4 years in some thousands of words is a very difficult task and you cant expect anybody to succeed in the attempt (specially when there is a deadline approaching) and although I might have failed miserably but I know that you will always know what you mean to me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> He perhaps must be one person who has changed the most during the course of his B.Tech, I dunno whether its been for good or bad coz I wasnt much of a friend of his in the initial phase.One very important thing about him is, he values his friends too high (like me), which has been a source of major disappointments and hurt for him in the beginning, but nowadays he has started taking things in his stride which is quite good  coz the people he meets in his life can't  be as good as him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>You gotta fucking stay in touch or else I will come down to Pune and frigging kill you. and remember the reliance mobiles which we have to buy. Would have loved if you were also in Hyderabad but as some wise man has said <b>Jo Hota hai achhe ke liye hota hai</b>. Lets see what good comes out of this<br><br><b>Most memorable moment : The outing we had on Mathur's bday and the time we went to Medchal at 1 am in the night<br>Song for you : Sookar Mere Man ko <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> </b><br><br>Cheers!! Keep rocking.. as your email id suggests <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> With lotsa love!! </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Maruti aka Billu aka Kelso aka Roomie</b><br><br>Maruti Borker Roomie, that's  what his name is in my gtalk list. He would undoubtedly be my favourite person in the campus. He has always been like a younger bro to me, he is the only person in this campus, who I am concerned about. It wouldnt affect me agar kisi aur ka kat raha ho but I tend to get irritated when I see this happening to him. He is the person in campus who I am most concerned about.<br><br>Starting from the beginning, I remember him as the pondy com of the batch, he was the first person who got mplayer running, which meant we could see a lot of stuff. Infact his system used to be the screening point of stuff for the whole batch. His system used to be serve as common system, anybody would come, sit on his system d/l stuff and enjoy while he was in class. One such time I d/l one video named <b>Tutor Ra***st</b>, that particular video became one of the favorites, almost everybody saw that video on his system that day <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Recently (almost a month back), I found that video again and maruti was the first person I pinged after downloading the video <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Most of our interactions at that time used to be when we were working (BCing) in workspace. I remember him as a friend of Pk n Piyush, and almost all my interactions with him were due to them, coz he would always be with them whenever I saw him.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>He is the person who has been the reason of tears in my eyes, most of us will remember that fateful night in room no 146. His hurt, his disappointment, the way he broke down, that has been one of the most moving moment in the 4 years of B.Tech for me. Buddy just love you, so glad to have you here with me <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Then came 2nd year, when he became my roomie, and it was a golden period of my life. Thats when I came to know this guy closely, the many facets to his personality. He is a stand up comedian, you could just sit back and look at him and I promise you that you will have time of your life. Its so much fun seeing him doing all those harkatein. That whole year, I laughed more than ever just because of this guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Thank you buddy for all the laughs. Another thing about him is that he is a completely hassle free roomie, he is the best roomie you will ever find. He will never complain about anything you do. Almost the whole year, it was as if I am living alone in the room <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. He didnt have any problem with sound, so I could play anything on speakers even when he was sleeping <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I could play any songs of my choice (except Old Hindi songs, which he hated). All the times I leofied him, he is and will always remain my favourite target to leofy, coz of the reactions he gives, and the awesome thing is, he never minded and would be normal, after a long session of leg pulling. We shared a common love for <b>That 70s Show</b>, I started watching the show and he followed the suit. The break between 3rd and 4th semester, the only thing that would happen in our room was 70s show, we would wake up, start 70s, have lunch, followed by 70s then dinner followed by a long session of 70s. It was such an awesome time, <b>That 70s Show + Friendship</b>, perfect recipe for AWESOMENESS <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Those times spent in C-16 were just awesome <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>Towards the end of second year, we started growing apart, he decided to concentrate on his studies and as a result of this, he would leave the room b4 i woke up and come back after I would have slept, which meant almost no interaction for days on end. But still then being roomies, we used to have our share of fun as and when he was in room. Coming to 3rd year, which was the real reason for us growing apart, I still remember that he got the room in our wing in the beginning, but as he was sick and couldnt come to hostel, the room was taken up by Manish. I was completely anti against this as I would have loved to have Maruti in my wing instead of Manish, with whom my interaction wasnt that much at the time. Finally he got the room on 3rd floor and that almost brought it to an end. Though I still remember that sometimes he would come to my room and then we would go to his room and do some BC there. At times (though very rare) I would also go to his room but me being the lazy guy that I am, didnt go upstairs that often. Slowly and slowly, we grew completely apart. This meant just saying a <b>"hi be"</b> when we meet and doing some BC but that was almost all the conversation we had in 6th and 7th semester. I would just listen stories about his achievements, his CG, his internship in Google and would feel glad that although he is not with us anymore, but its better for his career. He had now become a studious, kasi guy who would spend all his time working and reaped rich benefits for them.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>He is the funniest guy I have ever met, he is a stand up comedian, you just sit and observe this guy and his antics will make you ROFL <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I just absolutely love it when he is speaking Hindi (which is always), there are a few specific words which we mispronounces, like he speaks <b>galla</b> instead of <b>gala (as in throat)</b>, <b>fatar</b> instead of <b>patthar</b>, and things for him <b>gumti (as in lost)</b> nahin hain instead <b>ghoom </b>ke aa jati hain <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. The way he reacts to situations, just love it!! Am a fan of this guy!! Just too awesome.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>After growing apart in 5th sem or so, we werent too much in touch until 8th sem, and I am thankful to swimming which I think was the initial thing which brought us closer, the 1 hour BC we used to do in swimming pool, me trying to drown him in the water and her crying for his life, it almost seemed like we were back to normal. Slowly, slowly things started getting better. He would always come to our wing before lunch or bfast and then we would go together. It was at this time, that we all realised that how much we missed him all this time, I always used to think that it didnt matter much to him, when to my surprise he comes and says <i>"Mujhe lagta tha ki main hi tum logon ko miss karta tha, it feels great to know that you guys felt the same"</i> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, it almost felt like we were back to 3rd sem <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 5]</b><br>And ofcourse how can i forget all the times we spent doing <b>You know what</b>, the thing itself is awesome and add to it friends, it just becomes incomparable <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Will always remember the story about the song <b>I am the Walrus</b>, and your rendering, <i>teacher sali makdi thi, lennon ne assignment nahin kiya and blah blah</i>. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ROFL!! ROFLMAO!! <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>One thing about him is, he hasnt changed even a bit in all these years, I used to think he would have matured in all this while but when I talk to him after more than a year, he is still the same kid who was my roomie. Thats why at times I keep wondering ki sala Bangalore mein koi iska kat na de, here we were all friends but there it would be all different. Another thing with him is, he is so good hearted, he doesnt want to hurt anybody ever that's why at times he would agree with people even when he doesnt feel the same and it seems a bit artificial to me at times. I dunno if I am the only one to observe this or some other people also have felt that. :| It pains my heart to know that he has to go to Bangalore or else there wouldnt have been any doubt as to who I wanted as my flat mate. He will always be my first choice. Will miss you a lot buddy <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> and will always rue the one and half year we wasted <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best!!<br><br><b>Most Memorable Moment : I am the WALRUS <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br>Song for you : Tujhpe qurban meri jaan<br>An advice : Grow up, don't  be a kid anymore <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b><br><br>Cheers!!

<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Maroo aka Madooo aka Raju Time Table aka CAT Guruji</u><br><br>So finally I sat down to write the testi for this guy jiska nam hai Maroo...<br><br>Starting from the beginning, we werent too close friends in first sem or so. Rewinding back , I seem to remember that it was almost always in pagare's room or first floor that I met him. The event of me going to his room or he coming to mine was very rare, infact I cant seem to remember anytime when he came to my room <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Although I remember the outing we had in the first sem, which was almost courtesy Maroo, he was the only guy who knew about Hyderabad and thats why he acted as a guide to us. To date that outing remains one of the most memorable outing we have ever had. Thanks a lot Maroo for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Along with Adi he was the person who was completely against the concept of the formation of a group <img src=Smileys/14.gif />, a view point which tahnkfully was over ridden by the majority and we got TB as a result, which has been one of the best thing which most people in the group consider as the best thing to happen to them in these 4 years. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> The formation of the group led to a lot many outings, one special feature of many of these outings used to be that, we used to roam around on roads in search of Autos and kept singing songs like Road-side mawalis, which used to be a source of frustration for him, Maroo always the excited guy wanted to sing along with us, but since we used to sing Old songs, he would never know the lyrics and get frustrated <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>Although we were friends but it was only in the second sem when he shifted to cellar as a roomie of Pk, who was my previous roomie that we starte to bond well. After all pehle vo 3 floor upar rehta tha.. main thehra aalsi, itni upar kahan jata and vice versa for him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> One of the most significant event in the 2nd year was when he sorted out the differences between me and Pappu, I still remember he used to go on long walks with us (and tab tak he used to be a pakka time table, itne baje padhna, itne baje khana, itne baje sona), he sacrificed his time table for our sake. Finally thanks to his effort there was peace between Me n Pappu, can't  thank you enough for helping me regain a friend whom I almost lost.<br><br>3rd year for Maroo meant just Felicity, all his time, energy n  thoughts were dedicated to Felicity and almost everything he did was related to Felicity, which resulted in him growing apart from people without him even realising it coz he was too busy with Felicity. I remember many of us had the same problem with him. Even I didnt interact with him much except talking about Felicity but I dunno why, but I never got the feeling of being detached even at that time. Even in those times, he always remained as close a friend as he was before this Felicity tamasha.<br><br>Ofcourse when I talk about Felicity how can I forget to talk about his dedication towards Felicity, He lost (and regained ) many a friends coz of it, he screwed his grades, he screwed his time table. He basically screwed up with the principles on which he had based his life <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> The quoute of <b>Early to bed and early to rise</b> was given a toss and the whole semester was filled with night outs, one after the other.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>And then came the final year, which is definitely the Golden Period of our friendship, this is when he came to our wing. Since then it has been nothing but a joy ride <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Had a lot of fun with this guy. So many things we have done together in the wing be it <b>Mathur ki Chop, Manish ko chu**iya bachha bol ke uski marna</b>. One of the ROFLest thing he started was, when he had to fill his water bottle at times he would drag the whole wing to the water cooler to fill their bottles, during one such trips, mathur's room was opened forcefully and he was dragged away while he was watching STUFF <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and ready to do something <img src=Smileys/3.gif />  Will never forget the look on his face at that momemnt <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Talking about CAT prep, he was always sincere about CAT and since I too was going to give CAT, he bloody used to keep poking me to work for the bloody exam. I had left giving Mock CATs but it was only due to his effort that I started giving them again. All the effort I have put in the prep of CAT, which involved analysing my mock CAT papers and doing some DI papers was courtesy him. I have never seen any guy so concerned about someone else's preparation as he was for me. To this date I mantain that his contribution in me getting the IIM call is equal to my contribution in it. I will never forget the 2 and half hour rebuking session conducted by him (assisted by Chand), and that too when he was averse to wasting time as it would hamper his preparation. Man, I have never founf anybody so concerned about his friend as you were for my CAT prep, thanks a lot for everything you did back then, will never forget and will never be able to repay you back. You were just too awesome man.. THANKS A LOT <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I always wish that you are with me the next time I give my CAT coz next time it would be more difficult for me to prepare as I would be working the next time.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>Next came the placement season, me and him had to go through the pain of clearing so many written tests and returning back disappointed after failing yet another interview. We would be sitting there, waiting for the interview, give our best, do well in the interview and then come back dejected and rejected together, curse the company and then go next day and clear yet another written exam and the porcess going on. By the time we got placed (in the same company) I was the guy with highest interviews and he was the runner up <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I still remember the day I had my NVidia interview and I was returning back dejected, tired almost finished, not able to speak. I and Adi went to Suraj, and there came Maroo's phone, he told me <i>"Chinta mat kar, dulhan ani to hai hi, bas date pakki hone ki baat hai (or something like that <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) </i>. He also had the Nvidia interview and he too faced the failure and yet he called me up to console me. Love you man for that <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> One of  the most memorable phone call in my life.<br><br>I wont write too much about how excited he gets, or how dedicated he is, or blah blah.. Or how people at times are afraid of him, even I am afraid of him whe n I do <b>You Know What <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b> but at other times he is the nice shishya of mine....<br><br>Ofcourse how can I forget our Guru-Shishya ka rishta, he always calls me his guru, and both of us the <b>"Guru-shishya"</b> jodi leofy people together, be it Manish in the wing, where we forcefully christened him <b>Janice</b>, or the <b>Chu**ya bachha, HPS</b> nicks I gave him which we popularised <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and told almost everybody. Another enjoyable thing would be the <b>Leofying of Maglu </b>which is our fav time pass in the mess, we keep leofying him about his love for Australian team.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 5]</b><br><br>My most painful memory would be when you told me that you were finally going to Indore, <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I just couldnt hold myself together, it was as if someone had taken my lifeline away from me. For others it didnt come as that big a shock but with you it was that you might stay here in Hyd which was the main reason for it hurting more. I just couldnt see you for a long time after that and came to my room just after that as I wanted some time in solitude to digest this fact. Luv u loads man <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> I always wish you hadnt given me this moment <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the best....

<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Manish aka Jaat aka Chu**ya Bachha aka Hara*an Putri Savitri aka Dassi</u><br><br>I didnt know the guy too much in the first two years, all that time I just knew him as roomie of Chand, a fodu par excellence, and a guy who would cry a lot when it came to academics. Nobody would ever forget the Physics incident when he literally cried with tears in his eyes and finally scored the highest marks in the whole batch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Iski abhi tak is baat pe li jati hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> My interactions with him during the first two years were quite restricted to very few times when I would come to Chand's room. I distinclty remember cursing Chand at times coz his room used to stink a lot only to be told that it was due to this guy and true to his reputation his room still stinks a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Coming to third year, that's when our interaction started, I remember that the room allotted to his was originally allotted to Maruti and then Piyush was supposed to come in that room. So, when he came to the room, I was a bit disappointed as I wasnt too friendly with him them. But we gelled almost instantly when he was my wing mate in 3rd year. I will always remember the endless BC we (Chand, him and Me) used to do, and all the night outs we did which frustrated Vipul a lot and the next day he would curse our lot for not letting him have a peaceful sleep <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>Then came Microsoft internship which took our relation to a new level, ist when I really found a friend in Manish. The endless BC we did in Microsoft, having all our meals together, going for lunch, snacks and dinner. All the time we waited for Adi <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Meeting <b>Watermelon</b> and laughing on her face <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Staring at all the hot chicks in MS... MSIT wali yaad hai na <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Then the MS party <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I don't think you will ever be able to forget it, and mujhe kuch khas yaad nahin hai uska <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> All the foosball games we played, how you always used to win courtesy that andhi shot you used to play which was illegalised later <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> All the fights between you and Adi <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All those lunches when me & adi used to eat Pasta and you would stick with  the old & faithful DOSA :| All those times you used to urge us to go to Building 2 but me and Adi used to be satisfied with Building 3 jahan hum to pasta kha lete the but tera kat jata tha <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All those holidays when we went to MS just to play TT & Foosball. How can we forget BYCTW day jab Adi ki wajah se humara kat gaya tha and T-Shirt nahin mil payi thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And ofcourse wo IIT-Delhi wali jo mujhe pakati thi and phir uske baad tum logon ne jo meri li thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (and ofcourse admiring her figure <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) Cursing IIIT ki bandiyan jo wahan pe bhi <b>"you know kaisi"</b> rehti thi :| Hum dono mil ke adi ko jo pakate the <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All the maazas and hot chocolates we shared <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All those rides back home on my activa and those struggles between u n adi to come with me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> And ofcouse your last day at MS jab hum tripling karke aye the <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I will feel so odd when I wont find you guys when working in the company <img src=Smileys/2.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;<br>contd...<br>Then came fourth year which again added another chapter to our relation <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All those times Maroo and Me would leofy you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Irritating u atleast 50 times each and every day <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I cant tell hw much I enjoy irritating you. And I dont think you will forget the day I irritated you the most, that day was really legendary <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Most awesome part was, when he later told me, <b>"Aaj tak zindagi mein kabhi mere sar mein dard nahin hua but aaj pehli baar hua courtesy you <img src=Smileys/14.gif />"</b>. But the most memorable thing about it was, the next day he got the call from MS, confirming him as a FTE of MS <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Which also reminds me of the grand party in <b>Little Italy</b> thrown by him, which is by far the most expensive party we have had (including the booze ones <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) The bill that day was 6400 <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Sala 4th year mein mujhe aur Chand ko smoking ki adat lagi to is bande ko passive smoking ki adat lag gayi.

<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Adi aka Alsi aka Bond aka Wikipedia</u><br><br>I have seen many Bonds since coming to IIIT, and have been a fan of different attributes in different people, but the first person who I started considering Bond in IIIT was Adi. He was the proverbial bond with his matured n sophisticated demeanor. No random BC, apne kam se kam rakhna. Not the exact definition of outgoing guy, you wouldnt find him doin BC with random people who he doesnt know too well. This was one of the reason, why we didnt gell well. We never talked too much, one of the reason was that both of us being lazy and our rooms were 2 floors apart, which meant almost no coming to each other's room. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Another quality of him is, he is the quintessential gentleman, spohisticated, suave, fine grained, you can keep on listing such qualities and they wouldnt be sufficient to describe him. Thats why it was more than fitting that he would be the guy who would work closely with our dear GAG, who stresses a lot of gentleman like behaviour. He has stood the test of time when it comes to being the gentleman, whenever all of us would be <b>machaing</b>, he would be standing in a corner observing us. You would never have seen him <b>leofying</b> anybody ever. <br><br>Another very important facet of his character being his laziness, he was the first person whose laziness was discovered (later on Raman & Me were also added to the group). Never has there been an outing where we  don't have to wait for him. I think even the girls would fade away when you compare the time taken to get ready into account. This guy taked atleast an hour to get ready whenever we have to go anywhere and hence has been at the recieving end of many curses from people.<br><br>Since time is in short supply, will try to be a bit concise <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br><br>Our real gelling factor has been Booze, everybody remembers the time when he wouldnt let Vibhav sleep in his room when he would come after a booze session but later on he became one of the biggest bewda of the batch. Since the time he started drinking both of us have been a constant feature in any booze outing we have ever had, its rare that you see us missing from the scene if Booze is the buzzword <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We have had some pretty good conversations after booze, I still remember once in NBH, he told me a few secrets which he had never told anybody and to date, those secrets are preserved deep within my heart <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I fondly remember that after all those sessions we would tell each other that its only while drinking that we talk and should start talking a bit more but would always fail miserably in the effort and our conversation would be postponed to the next booze party <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Ofcourse his work during Placement season is commendable, Nobody ever thought that this guy would put so much effort and work his arse off for placement, but he made us all eat our words. His work during the placement season was exemplary <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Kudos to you!! I will always remember the day I had my interview with NVidia, this guy took me to their office as the cab provided by them had to go. Not only did he drop me there but when I came out after giving my interview, he was outside waiting for me <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Luv you for the concern you showed that day <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> I wasnt in the best of my shape, wasnt even able to speak up, was dead tired having eaten nothing after the bfast, almost 12 hours of tension coupled with nothing in my stomach. I am pretty sure, had you not been there that day, waiting for me. That would have been the longest journey I ever undertook <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 3]</b><br><br>Then came M$ internship, which definitely redefined our relationship, the 4 months spent there were just wonderful. The fun that the three of us had there was just incomparabale, I can never expect to have so much ever again in Coorporate life, we almost made mockery of the boring tag associated with Job and had a truly great time. I will always cherish those times with great fondness wherever I go <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Will always remember all those games of Pool, TT & FOOSBALL which we had in Microsoft, all the times we would stay there till 11 in the night just so that we could play a bit more <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All those times when we would stop at the Ice Cream wala just so that I could have my sutta <img src=Smileys/10.gif />  This was the time, when courtesy you, I developed a taste for Limca which I still persist with <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the times you would come to my cube to do BC. All the times you made Manish & Me wait and we couldnt do anything except cursing you. All the times laughing at the <b>Watermelon</b> laughing at the name of the guy who used to sit beside me, I hope u remember the name <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the trips back home on my Activa. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> N definitely the most memorable thing in the whole 4 month period would be <b>Pasta</b>, from Bohemia. I think we must have had the same thing almost 60-70% of the lunches we had in MS <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> For sure Bohemia must have gained a lot from our exploits <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> How can I forget all those IPL matches we saw in MS, watching the IPL final while having Cup Noodles or Checking out News every now and then when Indian Boxers were sweating it out in the Olympics <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Solving that maths quiz and comparing our scores after every few turns <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Working would be so dull not having you around.

<b>For <a href=akagrawal.html>Aditya Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 4]</b><br><br>Almost everybody knows how important maths and numbers are in my life, and in him I found a guy who would share with me the interest in numbers. He is one of the very few people who I deeply respect for their mastery over numbers <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and I think at times I have even spoken about this, when I am not in my senses. All these similar qualities which we posses (laziness, numbers, luv for booze) make me wonder why we didnt become good friends earlier, may be it was always meant to be so, destiny had this in store for us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>The guy is a very generous heart, he has given innumerable parties to us. He would never think twice anytime you ask him to sponsor your ice cream or booze. Most of the times we go to Club 8, it would be him who would shell out the extra money from his pocket and almost invariably he would never get the money back. <br><br>There's a lot more I would have loved to write.. May be some other time <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Wising you all the best for your future!!<br><br><b>Fav Memories : First would be the evening after my NVidia interview, All those times we boozed, All those times in MS<br>Song for you : Sala main to sahab ban gaya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> & Peene Walon ko peene ka bahana chahiye <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b><br>Cheers!!

The guy has a paper to his credit, got admits in Fodu Universities while no one ever thought that he would be able to achieve these feats. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> All of this has been achieved courtesy the hard work he has put all these years in LTRC.

He even knows the stats of players from 70s and 80s <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Another aspect of his character is the American accent he has, he has been the subject of a lot of leg pulling courtesy his wonderful accent.

He had a reputation of being moody and since our paths never crossed much, so never got the chance to talk to him.

The course has just 4 students him,chand, vipul and me; this is when I started interacting with him, and that's when I realised that this guy is fun to be with. Another facet of his character come to the fore in this year Felicity. I have always seen him as a cultured and sophisticated guy but thats when I came to know ki jab ye machane pe ata hai to he is second to none. At times when he comes to his full form, people just stand back and appreciate him <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Coming back to IDL course,its been so great fun having him in the same class, he has made bearing this course a little easy. I have been quite frustrated with the course and at times it has been hell but if you could pick up the guy who has been frustrated most with the course, its gotta be him. Frequently after the class, there would be a heated outburst by him against the profs of the course, that would be hilarious. The best one was when he was talking about  going to our dear ol' dean and complaining that they can't  make people work so hard in a HSSM <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ROFL!!<br><br>He is one hell of a guy, the guy after doing his B.Tech from CS is now going for a PhD is psychology, the first time I heard this, i was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> WTF!!

Cheers to you for having this spirit man.	<br><br>His ability to do BC is infinite, he can do bC all day, all night with each and every person. I don't remember ever going to his wing for BC and yet he would always come to our wing for BC, the range of topics on which he can talk is quite wide, he can do bc on almost everything ranging from music, literature, philosophy, history, mythology, college life... almost everything. And yet he never gets tired of doing BC, others at time start getting bored but he can keep on going.<br><br>A fellow blogger, he is also one of the people, who like me are worried about the dying blogging culture in IIIT. We tried to do our bit to encourage more bloggers but we failed miserably. He has my partner a lot of times doing "You know what <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". I will always remember the monologue he gave about getting high on everything, supposedly he can get high on <b>eating ghee, climbing, walking, running</b>, basically there is nothing in the world which doesnt make him high <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Gotta lot of things to write but running short of time <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> May be some day <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future and keep writing and enjoying your life.<br><br><b>Most memorable moment : The law we devised this year Felicity rock night <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b><br>Cheers!!

<b>For <a href=shikhaaggrwal.html>Shikha Aggarwal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Shikha aka Chuchu</u><br><br>Shikha, my cute little sister in IIIT (though age mein badi hai but dekhne mein to chhoti hi lagti hai na <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I never liked her much in our first sem or so, I can discreetly remember I-Day in our first year when I thought that she was quite haughty, as she and Prashasti were shushing us first years coz somebody had asked them to do so. Later on as time flew by and we get to know each other more, I realised that she wasnt so haughty after all.<br><br>The stories of her bondness could go on to fill volumes and yet they wouldnt be exhausted 9 Pointer, Intern in MS, Job in Google, 5 IIM calls, and pata nahin kis kis subect mein TA. Phew.. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> Main kahan, "Is even sky the limit??" . When it comes to studies, she and I are poles apart, she is the sincere student, always cribbing about assignments. She even enjoys studying <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif />  <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I mean how can you do that?? Even in 8th sem after being placed in Google, she is sincere abuot her assignments <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>We almost invariably bonded over the 27 hour long bi-annual train journeys to Delhi we have undertaken all through our B.Tech, the train trips used to be so much fun, me & Pk teasing her, all 3 of us fighting for the window seat. Wish we could do it once more <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Our relation has always been full of crests and troughs since the time she tied a rakhi on my hand for the first time. We would have VERY long BC sessions at times which would span for hours on end and then again, there would be months on end when we wouldnt talk at all, or even see each other once. Its been a very different story altogether. There have been some reasons which have ensured that things remained this way and will remain the same, so both of us have learnt to take it in our stride. And whwnever we meet, its always so much fun teasing her, giving a pat on her head ;D I sooo luv doing it!! Mast maza ata hai.. chidhane mein aise <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>

It was sometime in 4th sem or so, I guess. She was shocked beyond belief at the prospect of me. I still remember she made me promise that I wont smoke again, but I being the intelligent fellow crossed my fingers and the result is known to everybody <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> But now she has grown used to the fact that I wont leave it, to zyada chein-pein nahin karti and chup chap se rehti even if I do it in front of her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Its been real pleasure knowing you, waise to I know you will decide your future yourself, but anyways All the Best!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Most Memorable Moment : would be all the train trips we had, they were just plain Awesome <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>An advice : Dont dare forget the promise you made that day in front of DLF of finding a girl for me in Google<br></b><br><br>Cheers!!

<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Manish aka Mux</u><br><br>He must be one of the people who I started hanging out with, in the beginning of first year. I can still remember his and Maglu's room used to be the first one that would come to my mind when I thought of going to somebody's room. He must have been the guy jiske sath maine sabse zyada ragging di thi, and this guy used to make even that fearful thing fun. I will always remember the astonishment and frustration on the faces of seniors when he would answer their questions <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> There were many things he would do, which forced me to burst into laughter in front of the seniors. For one, he would never watch <b>Stuff</b> saying, "aisa karna sahi nahi hai Sir <img src=Smileys/2.gif />". I still remember  the one time that he was forced to sit below the table coz he wouldnt see it or the other time he was made to go and sit below bed and he would comply all these demands by the seniors with ease.<br><br>He is the perpetual bewda of the batch, anytime you see him, iski aankhein laal hongi and even the way he behaves, it seems that he is talli <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but he doesnt drink, pakka brahmin jo thehra <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. I still remember first year mein iski apni mom se kitni gandi fati rehti thi <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. One of the awesomest thing he used to do in first year was that he would always keep his mobile inside a suitcase. Could never figure out what was the logic behind this, he would take out his mobile just once in the night when his mom would call him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>One thing he has done in IIIT is making portals, he has made portals for each and everything <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Batch tee decide karni ho, Felicity tee decide karni ho, Batch trip ki baat ho, kuch bhi decide karna ho, he would always be ready with a portal in a jiffy.<br><br>All the best for your future man, Will miss you and your antics for sure <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cheers!!

<b>For <a href=goyal.html>Mohit Goyal</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Mohit aka Maglu</u><br><br>One of the most awesome guys of the batch. Whenever you see him, he would always have a smile on his face. One of the earliest friends of mine, started talking as we both were in Section-B. Its always so much fun hanging around with him. There are quite some things about him which make him so adorable and memorable, his funny accent, the way he could never learn to pronounce the <b>"au"</b> sound. I still remember how I used to make him speak <b>aur</b> back in first year and he would never be able to speak it out. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Of late he has been a majour source of entertainment in mess, coz of his love for Australian cricket team. Even in matches involving India and Australia, he would always support them, which has led to many a stories and a lot of leofying of him in the mess. More often than not Maroo & me would be the main culprit when it came to pulling his leg, all the stories involving him & Ponting, Hayden, Symonds <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> will always remember this BC. But the guy never ever minded anything we said, he would always be smiling his famous laughter. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>In the end would like to tender an apology if I ever hurt you :|<br><br>Wishing you all the best for your future. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>An advice: Learn how to speak "aur" <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b><br><br>Cheers!!

<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Deepti aka F1 GP</u><br><br>The fodu and witty girl with a smile on her face, would be my description of this lass, if asked to do so in a single line. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Deepti was the first among the girls of our batch, who I really started to talk and didnt exactly hate. I used to dislike both Shikha and Prashasti in the initial phases of first year. This girl, since the first time I talked to her, have always been quite fond of her, which at times makes me wonder why isnt she among close friends of mine. I can ponder as long as I wish on this question and yet I wont be able to come up with an answer to the question.<br><br>She is also one of the people who believe in fodam-fadi when it comes to academics. 9 Point someone, Google women engineering award, went to Singapore in the exchange program and blah blah. I mean are koi limit bhi to rakho yaar achievement ki?? Sab kuch hi fod daaloge kya. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>She is quite a funny girl, has quite some wit, given the fact that she is a girl, this is quite shocking <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> She is definitely the wittiest among all the girls I have interacted with in IIIT. The wit part of her is quite evident when she <b>leofies </b>none other than SKP aka Pati Sir on twitter, its always a lot of fun seeing all the tweets whenever both of them are trying to outwit each other, a battle of wits <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Another interesting facet of her is that she always keeps getting hurt and all. I mean two major accidents, are ladki samabhal ke raha kar na, kitne accidents karaegi re..<br><br>One problem I have with her is that she is a complete miser, been a TA for so many sems and abhich tak ek baar bhi mereku party nahin di <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I remember there was some time in 3rd sem or so, when she promised me a party for sure and that party is still due.

Will always remember him for the smile which is always falshing on his face. One of the very few people whom you will always see with a smile on their face. A mastkhor, you will always have a great time when you are with him. He was one of the initial friends I made in IIIT, courtesy Prithvi House performance we did in our 1st year Freshers, I still remember the <b>Das Bahane</b> dance group he was a part of. <br><br>He has always been a guy who you can trust with anything, I still remember the dedication with which he prepared the our juniors for the dance on their freshers night. He would be sitting in the lobby of 1st floor with his laptop and making the juniors dance until they did it correct. <br><br>Again one of the people <b>"satofied"</b> by me, whenever I meet him, i would slap his back, anybody can imagine how he must feel when I slapped this lean thin guy.

Always been a happy go lucky type guy always ready to share a laugh with you. Didnt interact much with him over the first two years, but then our interaction increased when he came to OBH. I will always remember the booze these guys had at the end of our wing, the guy was hell bent on ounching each and everybody in sight, and he DOES punch hard. That day I remember I was making pegs for him but the dumbass would pick up a glass and drink neat vodka (and that was his first time afaik) and he wouldnt even agree to drinking water after that. I dunno what he is made of, he was normal even after having neat vodka for the first time (later on you get used to it, but the first time <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> ).

Thats when I came to know of this guy who hails from Garhwal. A relation is always forged itself if you come to know that the guy hails from the same place where you have lived for five years, a place you are in love with. In our case <b>Uttarkashi</b> was the connection. I lived in that place for 5 years and his village is situated in the same district, we have had so many conversations discussing the place and <b>Garhwal</b> in general. I always enjoyed when in first (or was it 2nd ) year when he would show me some Garhwali videos on his mobile though I dont understand garhwali but It always felt like going back to the times which I enjoyed so much. <br><br>The guy is one of the smart chaps in our batch, body shoddy mast banai hai bande ne.

<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Atul aka Aatulraa aka DVD aka Chhadami aka Dwivedi Babu</u><br><br>Dwivedi ji is my oldest friend in IIIT, our friendship predates our life in IIIT by almost a year. I still remember the first day I came to Bansal classes and sat besides this guy, who had scored spectacularly in the maths test conducted a few days ago. Needless to say I was quite impressed with his performance, we became quite good friends but then he moved on to one of the top section on the basis of his performance and I was left languishing in one of the lowly placed ones. One of the memories I have from Kota time is of a FIITJEE open test when he missed the first scheduled test which was maths and to my horror, the guy started solving that particular paper on his jeans. He also had things like <b>"Study rotation today"</b> written, Crazy and dedicated were the words I had for him that day.<br><br>Then cometh IIIT life and his life here can be divided into two major phases, one phase stretching the first 7 semesters when he was a guy who played <b>instruments quite well, sang nicely, was quite good at academics, was a member of the batch BB team, an active member of agni house and the Cultural Captain of the house</b>. He was a nice friend of mine even back then, it was always a joy talking to him <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> A nice person who was quite funny and entertaining, always enjoyed the sessions when he would play guitar or tabla.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br>Then came 8th semester and the guy went bonkers, I still cant understand what has happened to him, he seems to have gone out of his mind. These days he is a completely changed person a person who woul leave you ROFLing everytime you start talking to him. He has always had that accent which led him to sing <b>"Kalifornicasion" </b>but these days whenever he opens his mouth, the words seem to be coming from the mouth of a person who has been living in a village and not in the big city of hyderabad. Its been such a delight spending time with him these days.. Just too funny and specially the testimonials he writes. He is the limit of BC. <br><br>Have always been a fan of this guy for the way he has shaped up over the years in IIIT. From being a kid from the small town of Reeva who wasnt too aware of the ways of world in a big city, who wasnt too good when it came to speaking English and yet I remember that this guy had enough conifdence in him to overshadow all these cons. I still remember once in the beginning of 1st year, he went on to stage (don't  remember the occasion, it happened in Motorola) he went on to stage and he meant to say something like "I wannna be the best singer" and instead said "I am the best singer"(or something of that sort). The entire class was laughing and yet thi guy was completely unflustered, not even an inkling of frustration on the face of this guy. Will always admire and respect you for the confidence you have in your abilities and gotta say its not unfounded. You have the substance to have this belief.

<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[Part 1]<br><u>Prashasti aka Sukdi</u><br><br>My interactions with girls@iiit have been rather sporadic and limited, save for this girl who has been one of my closest friend in IIIT. I dont exactly remember when and how we started talking must have been some time towards the end of first sem, coz I discreetly remember hating her in the beginning few months of first sem and then I remember being taught EC by her in 2nd sem. Waise who cares about the when and how it happened, but I sure am glad that it happened. She is one person whose friendship I will always cherish throughout my life.<br><br>Hailing from a small town in Chattisgarh, this girl has taken by world by  storm. Nobody else could satisfy the billing of <b>Over Achiever</b> then it would be her. She hasnt left any field unconquered, everywhere you can see the jhande <b>gadhofied</b> by her, be it becoming Sports Woman of IIIT, being shortlisted for Google Women Engineers, Being the highest placed person in batch. She has always been a person who everybody can look up to and draw inspiration.<br><br>I will also remember the countless times she taught me subjects ranging from EC, OS to DB, I am greatly indebted to her for my grades in quite a few of these subjects. I would surely have flunked in one or the other of these subjects had she not been there to teach me, and ofcourse the combined study we did for Industry & Society course back in our 3rd sem, when all of us were frustrated after reading all those boring terms and all, that was quite an experience. I still have the pics of that fateful night and get nostalgic everytime I look at those pics.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>[Part 2]</b><br>She is the first girl in the campus who I would turn up to, if and when I need an advice when the issue is girls in my life. She has been quite a help to me in all such times of distress, advicing me to the best of her knowledge and experience. Its been so much fun interacting with her over these years. She has been the patient listener to all my stories, disappointments, moments of distress. Since the time I came to IIIT, I had plenty of good friends but one thing which was sorely missing in my life@iiit was a (girl) friend and she has fulfilled that role very well. I am indebted to her for being such a good friend through all these years. At times I used to ping her when disappointed/frustrated with something or the other and wanted to talk to her, but the real trouble in such situations used to be that I generally found it very difficult to speak out what I felt. But this girl would keep cajoling me for hours until I came up with the story. I can understand how frustrating it must have been for her, waiting for the freaking guy to open up, she had to bear the frustration with a smile and gotta say she always did wonderfully and was again ready with loads of patience the next time, I was there with something to tell her. I will always remember the <b>Stars</b> wala conversation I had with her. I never could have thought that this kid could be so mature and philosophical.

<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>PSSS aka PSS aka Sharat</u><br><br>Almost 2 years ago, I wrote an Orkut testi to him, mentioning that he is the guy who defines the word <b>dude</b> and two years later, I still stand by what I said then. He is just way too cool. An awesome person to have as a friend. One thing which is always assured is that you can never be bored in his company, always fun to hang around with. An extremely sharp and creative fellow, you just have to listen to his ideas to appreciate the genius that he is. One bond that I share with him is the Astronomy Olympiad, we both have been to the camp which is organised in Mumbai. Actually this was one of the starting point of our friendship, I very well remember the time n first year when we all had made our sites as a part of ITWS-1 course, didnt know the guy quite well at the time, just a casual hi-hello type. The guy comes up to me and starts talking about Astronomy Olympiad telling me that he had also been to the camp, that was the first time that I had a feeling of kinship with the guy and since then its always been upstream. Have always been a fan of his out of the box thinking. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Its always fun to talk to him, displayed by the fact that he is one of the very few guys who I have had long conversation even though we talk in English(which I dont like at all <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, the eng part not the conversations <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) and the dumbass that he is, even though he knows Hindi, he prefers English and although it may sound like show-offing if somebody else does it but with him its just normal. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Bow to thee <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Here's wishing you all the luck for your future and hoping that you rock the world with your entrepreneuring ideas.<br><br><b>Most Memorable Moment : The sutt we shared on the rock night this felicity</b><br><br>Cheers to the DUDE of IIIT..

<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Prateek</u><br><br>Calm, serene, cool, ever smiling, friendly!! if you ask me to define this guy in 5 words these would be the words. A nice company to be around, the guy is always smiling and cheerful. Come what may but you will always find the person cool and calm. He being in my section in first year added to the fact that he lived beside Mux, I started interacting with him quite early in first year and now almost 4 years later I would say that I am glad to have had him as one of my friends in IIIT. If there is anybody who perfectly suits the billing of <b>Gentleman</b>, then it could be none other than him. Have always enjoyed my conversations with him. He has always been a silent worker in the batch, be it Felicity or Placements, he would always be there when you needed him and yet he would almost always go unnoticed and uncredited coz of the silent manner in which he would go about doing his work, surely an example to emulate.<br><br>Though he is in ECE, but have always felt as if he were in CSE, at times while couting the EC people, he is comfortably forgotten with everyone considering him as a CS guy coz of the interaction we all have had with him.<br><br>Have always been a huge fan of his writing, without any doubt consider him to be the best blogger in IIIT. Its always so much fun reading his blog posts, unfortunately the posts are a rare happening but each and every post of him has the power to make your day.<br><br>All the best for your future<br><b>An Advice: Blog, blog and blog man...

Its always so much fun talking to him or even looking at him, he would always keep entertaining you with all his antics. Famous for his PJs which transcend all the limits and force you to bang your head on the wall and yet he wouldnt stop and keep telling you more. A very bhola-bhala insan, one of the most innocent beings in college, at times you are left amused by his innocence and simplicity. His unique style of speaking is always a delight to listen, will never forget the way he said to Prof. Zulu "<b>Sir! Sir!! Sir!! </b>	I want to say this <b>Sir</b>, that <b>Sir</b> what you are saying <b>Sir</b>" (and I lost track after that, was ROFLing so hard <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ). He is an oxymoron of sorts, lazy enough not to work and yet dedicated enough not to take projects under Ramu or any such prof. He wants to get a MS degree without doing much work and yet he chose CVIT, the lab which is famous for its workload <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Have always liked the random ramblings of his on his blog and specially the poems of his <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Another interesting about him is his stories of the girls, every few months or so, he would have a new crush (and that too in IIIT, bow to thee man) and the innocent way in which he would tell you the stories would just make you ROFL.

He is always bubbling, bursting, bamboozzaling (dont even know if this is a word) with energy, always ready for a session of BC and fun anywhere, anytime with anybody. If ever there was a competition for the most friendly guy in IIIT, Ranga would win hands down, the guy talks to each and every freaking person in the batch, at times I am amazed how could he be talking to so many people. You name any guy in the batch and he will talk about him as if he were one the best friends of the guy, a fact quite evident from the large no of testimonials he has got. He is one of those people who hav always aacted as a bridge between the North and South guys in our batch.<br><br>Tum kuch bhi kar lo and yet you would be hard pressed to a <b>"shikan on his matha"</b> and yet I was able to frustrate him once, sumtym last year I guess. I used to think that my knowledge of hindi music is quite good and yet once I met him, I felt so humbled. He is a chalti firti library of songs, you name any bloody movie or actor or even music director and he will tell you the related song <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>A guy completely dedicated to his house Agni, even in 4th year he is always concerned about his house, sending mails regarding house activities and always worrying about house meetings and practices <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Its been so much fun knowing you, wish that this friendship goes on and on.

<b>For <a href=ambati.html>Bharat Ram Ambati</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Ambati</u><br><br>I wont say that he is among the popular people of our batch but there is no doubt that in LTRC, you would be hard pressed to find anybody who doesnt know him. The absolute LTRC bond!! I always remember NLP and NLP application courses, when we would be struggling to get marks in the range of 50s or so, he used to score >80 out of a total of 90 easily.<br><br>One incident about him which I would always remember would be from our first year. This happened during the initial phase of our 1st year. I being the complete <i>fukkad</i> that I am, was in need of some money to go to coffee shop and was unable to find anybody in the workspace who could lend me some money AND then all of a sudden a stranger comes to me and offers me 20 bucks <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I just said Thank You and left for coffee shop but the Awesomest part was, I didnt know him much by then. By the next day or so when I realised that I had borrowed money from him, I wasnt quite sure who he was. As a result I never could return him his 20 Rs coz it had been quite late by the time I came to know him in person. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>Man I still owe you those 20 bucks <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Wishing you all the success in your life. <br>LTRC ka nam roshan karna <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Cheers!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ahmed.html>Asrar</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Asrar</u><br><br>You ask me, if its possible to personify silence and calmness, my answer would be very simple, I would just ask you to meet this person. Even when he speaks, you have to strain every muscle in your ear to listen to and comprehend what he is talking about!<br><br>A guy for whom work and study seem to be the only time pass in life. He seems to be doing quite well for him in the academic field. After all these years when I look at him, all sincere and studious. I feel a very different sensation that his was the room where I did BC for the first time in IIIT ,when I didnt even knw what BC was. Quite unexpected given that I have never EVER had any BC session with him again, and have rarely talked to him since 3rd or 4th sem. Actually don't  even remember seeing him except the common classes of the whole batch!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>At times I have felt that he is not as colourless as he always portrays him to be, but unfortunately didnt interact much with him to discover more about this <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>All the best for your future man.. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>An advice :- Though I know speech is silver and silence is Golden, but please start speaking up for a change <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b><br><br>Cheers!! </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Ankush</u><br><br>Almost everybody knows about his academic accomplishment and the gentle nature of this person. The first thing which comes to my mind when I think about him is the gentle smile which is always gracing his lips. This marathi manoos, must be one of the most gentle and soft spoken guy I have ever met in my life.<br><br>Another one of my cellar mate, will always remember his and Sachin's room just beside ours. All the times there used to be the sound of some or the other game being played in the room and ofcourse all the immensely helpful tutes which were a lifeline for many of us. I have seldom seen a person who had such a hold over the concepts and the subject never mattered. Even in our 4th year we went to him to study Middleware, a course which he took last year, and yet, he was as always ever complying and ever so clear on the concepts...

<b>For <a href=ankits.html>Ankit Saraswat</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Ankit Saraswat</u><br><br>One of the very few people who I truly and deeply respect for their sheer intelligence and the only one in our batch. There must have been many a discussions on who must be the most intelligent guy in our batch and for me it will always be  him.Since first semester, he has been an iconic figure in the batch, being the first and only 10 pointer in first sem. Everybody in this batch must have heard countless stories of his intelligence and yet his stories continue to amaze me. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> At times I just wish I had a brain even half as bright as his.<br><br>He was the first guy from IIIT I met, we met during the couselling in Allahabad. My mother was quite excited to see a guy from home town (Agra). He was the classic example of first impression going wrong. The first time I saw the guy, he seemed to just a dumb guy. I don't think I could have been more wrong in judging this guy.<br><br>Havent had the oppuritinty to interact much with him but whatever little interaction we had has always been pleasant. I will always be thankful to him for the endless supplies of sutte when he & me were the only smokers in our batch but unfortunately whenever he would come to my room, I would never have a cig. Thanks for all those suttes man <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>One thing which I would always remember is the animosity we had in later part of our 1st year and 2nd year and its resolution. There was some misunderstanding which resulted in a bitter hatred amongst us. I remember, it was he who came and talked to me sometime in 2nd yr (I guess) which dissolved all the animosity. I seriously couldnt believe my ears on listening to the casual tone in which he talked to me. It was as if nothing had happened, just so simple and nice. My admiration for you, grew multifolds that particular day.<br><br>I don't think you need good wishes from anybody in this world. You can do WHATEVER you like...

We used to have our share of BC, in cellar, with one person calling the other the aforementioned 3 words. I for one  don't have any idea what these words mean, as they were invented(?) by him. I think he once told me about them but I  don't seem to remember too much of them now. :|<br>A funny guy to hang around with, the little interaction during the first two years will always remain memorable. I am used to being called weird and what not but this is one guy who will come tops, whenever you are talking about weirdness <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Even while walking normally he always has that air of weirdness. Both of us being weird being the reason why the both of us boded quite well in the beginning.<br>He also seems to be having quite an affinity for Ice-Creams, all his email ids have some or the other mention of Ice cream in them.<br>Dont think have spoken even one line to him over the last two years, its just a nice "hi" whenever one of us see the other.<br>Hoping for him to have a bright future.<br><br><b>Character he resembles:- Mr. Bean (can you even think of anybody more apt) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br>An Advise - Try and be the same, world needs some people like you who can be icy cool and aloof from the troubles.<br><br><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> - From a weirdo to the bigger one...</b><br><br>Cheers!!!

Zindagi ki sabse badi problem ye hai ki bechare ke balon ki jansankhya mein bahut girawat ho gayi hai, as a result he became one of the three <b>"Ganjes"</b> in our batch.<br><br>One of my cellar mates, will always remember the singing marathon, we used to have in NBH bathroom in 1st year. He, Shashank & Me used to sing random sings while bathing before the morning classes, freaking out everybody who was unfortunately stuck in the bathroom at the same time as us. Unfortunately although we were on the same floor for almost 2 years, we didnt interact that much, but I will always remember his room on the other side in cellar, C-8 with him an Pankaj saini as the roomies.

BUT isko ek baar bhi apne floor pe nahin dekha hai maine... Everytime I have met or seen him over the last 8-10 months, it has either been the coffee shop or on the road leading from OBH to Coffee Shop. If somebody obeserves him over the duration of a day, the person can easily conclude that it is the coffee shop where he lives and must be convinced into believing that he comes to the room just to complete the daily rituals (talking about which seems to be the second mission of his life).<br><br>For the first three years of my B.Tech, paro was just another guy with whom I shared a casual relation, aate jate kabhi milte the to Hi-Hello ho jati thi, thoda sa leofying over Sarukh Khan or that Tom Cruise look he sported.

<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Abhilash aka Fucker Sucker Licker Di**ker</u><br><br>He must be one of the biggest geek around who also excels in sports. The guy is known in most circles (except his close friends) as a geek who loves studying and who plays football well. Even I cannot claim to being a close friend of him now. Its very rare that either of us see the other these days, he being in NBH and busy in his research and all. We sort of started veering in different directions which resulted in almost nil interaction, and I think both of us being satisified with the way their lives were going, so none of us saw any need to change things around and things just kept going their way.<br>The first intro I had with this guy was as soebody who lived near Pagare's room, who Pagare intoduced me to. <br><br>For the whole first year, he was the only telugu speaking guy in group which at times used to be sort of inconvinient to him, specially when we used to go and watch Hindi movies. I still remember he came to watch some Hindi movie with us. Outings with him used to be some fun, he would invariably be playing football when we made the plans about any outing. As a result he wasnt made aware of any such trips, until the 11th hour which meant that, at times he came for outings in shorts and t-shirts all sweaty and dirty after a gruelling session of football.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhilashi.html>Abhilash Inumella</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Almost the whole batch knows him as the geek, the dedicated person, who continues to puzzle people by his dedication to strive for studies. He would always be thinking about this theory or that subject. He was always the one thinking about new ways to do things. One thing about him has been that he always dreamed big when it came to projects, a habit which I too picked up from him, resulting in Text to Image Conversion (our Hons. Project in LTRC <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I have always been amazed at his passion for studying and research, which suffered just a minor dent when he saw "Happy Days". I clearly remember me and him sitting in LTRC lab and he kept talking about how he wanted to "<b>enjoy</b>" his life. He wanted to have a <b>GIRL FRIEND</b> (which reminds me there was somthing going on for him in 2nd yr or so, some family frnd.. What happend man?? <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).

<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Abhishek Sainani aka Scientist</u><br>I remember this guy right from our first year when both of us were in 'B' section in our 1st year. Right from time immemorial, I can remember  him as the studious type of guy who was always sincere in classes, reaching classes in time, NO BC, no nothing of that kind. But in the class, all I could ever find him doing in the class was SLEEPING... He is legendary in the batch circles for his sleeping (and ofcourse his PJs, which I will talk about later).<br><br>I will always remember  this chap as a sweet, soft spoken, mild person. He has always seems to be so calm and balanced, I seriously don't know what is it that would take for him to be perturbed. I am quite confident that if I failed in the attempt, there wouldnt be many people who can stand up to this challenge.<br><br>Ofcourse nobody in this batch can ever forget the legendary fattes of Scientist, which have made his roomie Atul, pull out his hair at times.

<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Mathur</u><br>Mathura aka Mathure aka Mathuri aka TK aka lal tamatar!  Names galore for this freakishly thin vagabond who keeps turning red on every little thing. The earliest memories of him would be of the guy who had quite a nice config wala system in first year and the asshole was in my row ,making me go green with envy so many times when he would be seeing a movie on his system while even the lug moderators had given up trying to run mplayer on my shit of a system.<br>Later on I remember Mathur as a guy who was present in each and every b'day party whether it be NBH, GHEB, coffee shop, always there to kick some friendly ass <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Most probably that is how we must have become friends, mostly how he gains all his friends.. by going and talking to every freaking person. He is friendly with each and every person, must be one of those rare people in batch jo kahin bhi ja ke kisi bhi group ke sath kitni bhi der bc kar sakta hai.<br><br>Then in second year mathur came to NBH where he shifted to the 1st floor in the same wing as chand, adi, manish, vibhav. That must be the time, I guess 3rd or the 4th semester when me and him became close friends, usse pehle tak he was more of a time pass frnd.<br><br>I dont remember if it was the summer holidays after 2nd year or it was 5th sem and we were just having one of those walks, which more often than not were organised for the purpose of me going out to have a sutta (and those were pre-activa days). We were talking something about me and some girl, then mathur said something of the effect <i>"tujhse to main kuch chhupata hi nahin hun"</u>, I can still remember how glad I felt that day to hear this statement from him. The most important and valued thing in a friendship is trust and I was so glad that he finds me friend enough to trust me with his secrets. Ofcourse he has always been the person who hesitated the least (and hence my most frequent company) whenever I asked him to go out for a sutta <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Somehow the vagabond'ness' in him made him the person always eager to roam around.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Then come 3rd year, when we all shifted to OBH, he (unfortunately) got stuck on the 3rd floor while all of us got rooms on 2nd floor, he being alone in his wing and that too a floor above us. One of the valid consequence of this qould have been, he staying in his room as it was very rare that we went above to meet him. But instead, he became what is now known as Pseudo-Wingmate!! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> It was as if, he started living in our wing instead of his. You could either see him in Vipul's room, both of them doing some BC in the name of doing their honours project or in Chand's room doing some arbit BC with him, in my room reading my chat conversations or else in the wing agar general BC chal rahi hogi.<br><br>How can I forget all the BC we had in our wing, sabse awesome was <i>"Mathur ki chop hona"</i>, me, Manish, Maroo n Vipul would come together and say somthing like "Vande Matram" or sumthing like a slogan and then wont let Mathur say anything and as a result uski chop ho jati thi <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> We once did his chop when he wasnt even in hostel, phir usko msg kiya "Teri chop ho gayi <img src=Smileys/10.gif />" then once, the same happened in Cog Sci class, then again he was duly informed by a message. In the beginning he used to try, but tab uska munh band kar diya jata tha.. so later he just gave up <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>I dont think anybody in our group can ever forget the booze party we had in mathur's room back in 3rd year, when he ate all that maggi masala when there was nothing in his hand or the childhood secret he told us which got him the famous nick "tk" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I think that one among the very first times he drank with us and after the incidents of that night, he never really could muster enough courage to drink to tulluness after that night (ofcourse I will leave yest out of this <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) there must be many more secrets which he is afraid of people knowing about <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ofcourse, the most awesome thing about him is the lal tamatar one, he is one of the most allergic person. Anything under the sun can make him go red, it can be heat, cold, dust or you pulling his cheeks, even somebody shouting at somebody else can make him go red. And I so love him going red can never have enough of it, thats why keep pulling his cheeks. Two of the most memorable incidents in this regard would be first , the chennai incident, I once pulled his cheeks so hard that it became purple and he had to go to his cousin's marriage.. I am pretty sure there must hav been many questions from his family as to the source of the mark <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. To add to his misery, it looked like a love bite <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> the mark was still there when he came back from Chennai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> The other incident was when I ran a comb on his hand, the hand obviously went red but for a few hours, his hand was like furrows with clear depressions in his hand coz of the comb <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ROFL!! ROFL moment that was <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I just have one sort of qualm with him, even after saying that he would tell me anything in his life, he never told me much!! I dunno if I moved away or sumthing but frankly I never think that, unlike other people my friendship level with him never decrease... it was always increasing, if anything. Or may be he is the most uninteresting person in whose life nothing happens, I rather doubt if he shares with anybody for that matter. I have at times felt that he doesnt open up much. Another thing with him is, you never seen him sad, he could be either happy or angry but never sad at all, pata nahin bhai kaise manage karta hai. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Many people term me as the irritating one but the amount of irritation i have meted out to other people is nowhere near no of times I have irritated this guy, almost every night when vipul n maroo are asleep and he,me, chand and manish (the late sleepers) would be doing BC in their room. I will go to his room and pakaofy him, at times I would take his bottle and pour water on him, kick him, pull his hair and what not!! And to think of it, this has been going on for 1 year without this guy complaining once <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Awesome man.. I have had so much fun on your expense. Thanks for all the entertainment <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> I guess his claim of being benefited from JV came into fore here... He always claims that his anger has calmed down a lot since attending JV.. I dunno, I never even listened to JV. Another aspect of him is the TV show and movie junkie that he is. I always comment <i>"Aisa ho hi nahin sakta ki mathur ke room pe kuch video na chal raha ho",</i> its like whenever you go to his room ya to koi movie nahin to show or else a music video kuch to hamesha chal hi raha hota hai. I think the thirst of his socializing isn't satisfied even after being with people almost all the time, he wants more people in his life <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. And the only times that he is not watching any movie or anything, he would be playing CZ either on the LAN or with bots, quite a CZ addict the guy is.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mathur.html>Prashant Mathur</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If there is a count of the no of memories which you have with a person then this guy would be definitely be at the top for me. I must have the most memories with him. I wrote a whole testi about the incidents and still there are lots more left. Almost all my nights would be peppered with memories of Mathur. Almost every night something or the memorable would happen, i will laugh for 5 mins with a frustrated mathur looking at me and it is only then that I would come back. Hey man thanks for providing me with all those wonderful moments. Talking of memories, I will always remember how, mathur was always the last one to be intimated when we were going out and that too when evrybody else was ready, forcing him to come running, while other people were cursing him.... Will seriously miss the outings if there is no mathur coming down running, tucking his shirt in the pant. Will say that meri raatein to ekdum <i>berang </i> ho jayengi mathur ke bina <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. The memories will not cease coming to my mind, I guess the onus is on me to stop writing now!<br><br><b>Award for him : New super hero <i>"The Human Chameleon"</i> in Heroes<br>Fav Moment : Either vo comb wala nahin to vo gaal ke nishan wala<br>Song for him : Idhar Chala main udhar chala<br></b><br><br><i>Just one thing to say to you!!<br>Yaaron.... dosti badi hi haseen</i></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Chandddd..... hmmm!!!<br>Writing a testi for this guy would be one of the most difficult task I could ever undertake, describing oneself would be the most difficult job in the world, you know yourself too well that it just becomes a mess of things and it becomes more difficult for me when I set about describing this guy. It wouldnt be so difficult for me to start off with a testi for anybody else but I am quite at loss on how to start writing for Chand. Describing him in one word would be the simplest thing, I need to just write "Alter-Ego" and thats it, there can be no definition apt enough to describe him according to me. Chand and me, its like the similarities never seem to end, its like everytime we have some serious discussion we find some new thing which is common. Its as if, somebody is reading my mind aloud, and the similarity goes to an extent that at times we have had not only the same thoughts but have uttered even the same words at times in similar situations.<br><br>Chand and me didnt instantly hit off, infact ours was a late introduction considering the fact that we both are such big BC baazs!! I can still remember the first BC session we had in cellar, in front of the water cooler near the bed which was lying outside. I still cant understand why that incident is etched so nicely in my memory (given the fact that I considered him jus a badbola back then <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). I still rmr the time when we had our batch elections in first year, I didnt know this guy personally but it was only because he was the friend of some close friend of mine that I cheered and voted for him. <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Well I need not go into the details of him being the neta of the college, everybody from students to faculty to the guards can testify to the fact. Well frankly speaking I feel he must be one of the most influential person amongst all the batches we have seen but blah blah.... who cares!! For me the "neta" chand doesnt bear even an iota of semblance to the guy, and at times I find this chand too irritating when he is in his funde pelofying avtar, thats why I tend to avoid him at such times but the thing is that we roam around and hang out so much that you are bound to have such times <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> ! At times like this you (atleast I) can see him pretending, which I dont quite like. Its only when we are in the wing doing BC that he becomes the real chand, the chand who is my friend! <br><br>The alter ego part generally comes when we are alone discussing about any random thing under the sun. The duo of us must be one of the most frequent roamers in campus, right from 1st year when we used to count the number of pairs roaming around in campus, to 4th year when we go out to buy sutts in the day or at the night time to eat sumthing at DLF (coupled ofcourse with sutts <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) to the latest when the two of us were sitting on the roof sharing the suttes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>To think of all those pillion rides I had on his bike and all the fun we had on all those drives, for quite some time his was the only bike in our group (though pappu had brought his activa b4 him) and it was always great fun riding along with him. I still rmr the summer after our 2nd year when he got his bike and all the escapades we had then which would always land up in us being in trouble, his petrol would dry up or the bike wouldn't start and we had to drag the bike <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> It seems that all of this belongs to an era gone by and yet it all seems like only yesterday.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Talking about the common aspects (I know!!!) but the fact that I am testifying him does mean that I have to list out his character traits<br>Anger - Have never in my life seen a guy with an anger like his, I mean even the people who are on his side are shocked by the intensity leave alone the opposition... but the thing which even he accepts is that he doesnt shows his displeasure ever to be good to al around him, it all boils down and bursts up at once.. Dood try and mantain balance. You yourself are much important<br>Blank - The lolest thing he does is going blank!!! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> So many times it happens that he goes blank and is sooo late in understanding whats going on.. make it so funny!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> At so many such instances he has said so many stupid things, like the "80% above avg" wala funda <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Man will miss your antics<br>Orator, Artist, Muscle man - Whatever whatever.. Whole world knows he is just sooo gud in oh so many things, I don't care <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> and I know who also doesnt care too much.. these things are just too superficial for friendship<br>and ofcourse his self gloating (which thankfully has gone down appreciably)<br>His being blank and dumb and being called chand the chu** not withstanding, he remains the only person who can leofy me at any time forcing me to go silent and get into that sheepish laughter state.. I dunno why he seems to be the only person who I have never been able to irritate with all my irritation powers instead its always been the opposite.. I bow to thee Chand!!<br>But have to say, although I keep pulling his leg for all the funde pelofying sessions, i am so grateful to him for such sessions <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>And I am pretty sure that although he is a "Neta" here but he will become a great leader, not in a political sense or financial sense but in something which I dont know, someday because of his way of thinking. (Although he being my alter-ego i am praising myself too while praising him <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Most of all how can I miss all the BC we had in the wing, with so many sessions of vipul marofying him followed by him literally marofying vipul... All those times he comes in the wig shouting out "maddoooouuuuuu" the way only he can do! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All those nights when he would be so restless knocking my door every 15 mins or so coz he just couldnt stay without doing BC.... all the times he has come to my room finished off my water bottle leaving me a frustrated, cursing idiot <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> all those times coming to the room for toothpaste or mobile or the comb of mine which he has kept for himself.. all the things will be so memorable!All those suttes we shared in the wing as well as each other's rooms. Memory gazallions all so niice <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I have seen so many people so many times coming up to him for support and who believe and trust in him but the guy seldom goes to any person when in need of support, he just keeps it in himself bottling everything, takes sooooooooo long to open up to people to make them his friend in real sense. Dood you seriously need to pop open the screw of this bottle more frequently! and rmr i will always be there <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Looking back to a chand who was the friend of Pk, Shashank and who along with the 2 girls shikha, prashasti formed to group to chand the Mr. Fresher to chand the Mr. Neta to chand the friend and now somebody who is such a close and dear one it feels so pleasantly odd, feeling glad looking at all these memories so enthralling and feeling so sad realising that its just a jiffy which separates all life and fun this side with all the sufferings that side. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I'll always hav a qualm against Chand. Since time immemorial we had the plan that we will get into the same company and continue with our BC sessions there but this asshole of a guy had to screw up his Ivy Comptech interview and go to Fucking Bangalore! I can still remember the day we had the written test of Infosys and he didnt qualify the written test. I had got placed just the previous day and had gone through my share of interviews by then which were quite unnerving but no interview or test had stricken a fear in my heart as the prospect of facing him that day. I can never put in words the uneasiness which I was feeling at the time. I wished he could have just slept or something, couldnt even think of facing him. Both of us knew that it would be hell for the other person if one of us got placed and the other one didnt. Even our preparation was done together. The thing which was running in my mind was that I betrayed him by getting placed before him, I mean how stupid and idiotic of me to feel this way but somehow at the back of my mind that was the only thing going on. It wasnt the fact that he wasnt placed till then, the only thing was that I had got placed and deserted him. Thankfully he got placed 3 days later putting an end 2 my misery bt those 3 days wer like continuation of the ongoing hell fr me. It wasnt until he got placed that I was relieved and seriously that day, it felt as if I had got a second placement. I wish that we never the times be so hard on us<br><br>Dude u seriously need to get on a job hunt spree once you get to Bangalore, come back to Hyderabad ASAP, it'll be so lonely without u in Hyderabad man. we rock!<br>This testi still feels so incomplete but dont have it in me to write more... Will miss you man..<br><b>Fav moment :</b> Can be there be one such all our life is similar! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Must be each of those moments when we come to know about one more common thing between us <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><b>Song for you :</b> Hum dono jaisa hai kaun yahan!!<br><br><i>Just one thing to say to you!!<br> Yaaron.... dosti badi hi haseen</b></i></ul><br><br>
