<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the smartest guys of our batch and someone who is not afraid to speak his mind - Karan is one of those guys who I wish I had interacted more with but I was quite a jerk early on in my btech <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is extremely organized and has always been good with managing his acads and extra-curricular activities. I remember the time in second year when there was this controversy he got embroiled in and he handled himself with a lot of dignity and calm which is commendable <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br>Was the co-ordinator of Felicity 08 and am being totally unbiased when I say that it was the most well planned and executed Felicity that I have attended in the 4 years of my stay here and it was a lot of fun as well <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Congrats on getting into IIM-I and on securing a good job. You deserved 'em both. I know you will be extremely successful at whatever you chose to do in your future because you have all the qualities that define success. Loads of good wishes and keep rocking. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akdwivedi.html>Atul Dwivedi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I was thinking of writing a testimonial in "your style" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> but could not do justice to it so am sticking with what I know <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I knew him early on because of him being in Agni and can never ever forget that drama you guys did for our freshers. It was hilarious for all the wrong reasons <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Has been a very active member of Agni - cultural captain, very good singer and a bad dancer <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. We spoke quite often during Agni meetings and he came across as a very genuine person who really wanted to try all kinds of things , proof of which is him being in the rock band,trying out that Ghajini haircut, doing all kinds of arbit bc with me over gtalk etc etc. Of late he has become this extrovert and your monologue during one of the informal sessions(the hairstyle waala if i m not wrong <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) of farewell made me laugh real loud <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br>   Wishing you loads of luck for your future and have fun!!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhijeetp.html>Abhijeet Pagare</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Always knew him from a distance till the first year and an honest confession - always thought of him as this really cute guy <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> who dances well and is extremely popular but sleeps a lot <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Knew him better in the second year when we prepared for a dance (for the dance club <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and after that got to talk to him a li'l more. Has this casual air of confidence about him which is a great quality to have. Wish I had interacted more with him but anyways here's wishing you all the best for your future and keep dancing and playing cricket!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pgvijay.html>Prateek G V</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The guy most guys want to be like <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. At least thats what I infer from all the testimonials that have been written for you <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. It is not a surprise though because he is a thorough gentleman,very good at his academics, a super-integral part of Samvedana - has worked his heart out for it, has a unique <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> sense of humour, is very mature and understanding and the amount of effort he put in during the placements season was incredible. Worked really hard during Felicity as well and I have never seen him lose his cool.I got to know him in the 3rd year and remember him as this Scrubs loving, WWE fan with whom I had numerous fights (on-line of course <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) on facebook wrestler! <br>    Even though you've written "i'm no superman" in your profile, you really are <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Loads of luck for your future and stay the same. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>PS: Dude, expand your colour palate puhleezzz <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kishorepudi.html>Kishore Pudi</a></b>&nbsp;<br>He has a very positive vibe about him and even though I did not have much interaction with him till the 3rd year, I always felt that he is someone who is easily approachable and will never say no when you need help. We were in the same team for the EPP presentation and I remember how cool and relaxed he was while making the ppt and even more so while giving the actual presentation <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I kept bugging him to download these apprentice show's videos and he obliged and never got angry in spite of me constantly irritating him. Thanks a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>      Wishing you loads of good luck in the future and stay the same happy,positive person that you are.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ramya.html>Ramya Yaragani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ramya - one of the most hardworking,sincere and intelligent girls of our batch. I did not interact much with her in the first two years but have got to know her better over this past year and she is a very unique person in her own right. Whenever I go to her with any doubt she always helps me out with it and has never said no <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Her dedication to acads is unparalleled <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and congratulations on getting into Google. You deserved it. She has awesome knowledge about telugu songs and she along with Anu,KD and Harshi have won antakshari many times. She is a food freak too and inspite of that how she manages to stay so thin is beyond my belief <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br>        Wishing you all the best for your future and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=prashasti.html>Prashasti Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Prashasti is one of the most talented,balanced and intelligent girls I have ever met. We first spoke on the very first day of college before the english exam and have always been on good terms <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Loads of people do many things (for ex me <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) but Prashasti does all those things well too <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> and I have always admired her for having the maturity to balance things that well.<br>     Very good at throwball,athletics and all kinds of sporty activities but the surprise is she can dance well too (remember that dance where you wore the traditional AP dress <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. I am sure you will succeed in whatever you choose to do in the future and here's wishing you all the luck. Loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The most adorable guy of our batch <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Awesome energy and can always be seen doing masti during any event. An active member of Agni, hes an extremely talented guy who sings well,dances well and has this vast knowledge about movies and music.<br>     Things I will remember are all the dance practice sessions for Agni where we've always had fun and the awesome dumb-c and antakshari sessions. Anyone who comes across him will like him because he has a very good vibe about him and can always be seen with a smile on his face. Stay the same and people will always love your passion and zest for life. <br>      All the very best for all your future plans <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitingupta.html>Nitin Gupta</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My first impression of Nitin was this tall,lanky guy who wore this multi-colored shirt and had the most unique hairstyle <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. We used to speak often in the first year and he's a very nice guy to talk to. I always felt that he is very simple and straightforward and extremely likable. Only advice would be improve your communications skills a bit because sometimes that may lead people to judge you differently.<br>      Somehow did not talk much in the second and third years but of late we have started talking again - atleast through chats <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Here's wishing you all the good luck for your future and have tons of fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nagallas.html>Satish Chandra Prasad</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Asalu expect cheyaledu testimonial. Thanks a lot <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>I remember him being this very shy,quiet guy who never talked in class and our early conversations were about the interaction sessions and Agni. He once told me about how much he hated Jeevan Vidya and that was the first time we spoke properly. Me and Navatha would always try to talk to him but he was very reserved. But, when it came to the workspace and sharing the pc we used to have so many interesting confrontations and all those memories bring a huge smile on my face <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Sorry for making scp such a popular nick for you but its actually quite a cool name <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>      Wishing you all the good luck for your future and have loads of fun <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>PS: BOA is not near any of the places you mentioned <img src=Smileys/3.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ok so this is definitely unexpected <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. I am glad I beat you at this <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Most people know how we used to fight in the first and second year and that was partly because of how immature I was and partly because of well .. you <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. On a more serious note, I regret all those misunderstandings and fights and as much as I wish<br>I could take 'em back, I can't. But our conversations have hopefully sorted it all out <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br><br>     He is an awesome writer and his blog is one of the most well written ones around. Has been a great Agni team-player be it sports or cultural activities. Has won many accolades for our house and has always motivated and encouraged juniors to perform well for the house. <br>      Is very mature and understanding and am sorry if I ever hurt you because of my blunt way of speaking. Good luck for all your future plans!!!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;<br>This might come as a surprise <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. We went from being strangers to really good friends to strangers to friends once again <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Nevertheless, I am glad I started talking to him once again because he's one of the most straightforward,fun and friendly guys I have met here. Its no secret that he is very talented,has great social skills and is a friend on whom you call upon at any time. Can get a tad bit too philosophical at times but at the same time is astonishingly pragmatic too.<br>     I always feel safe when I am with him because he can kick anyone's ass( when required <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Has a great physique and can handle situations with lot of maturity. Things I will remember are the ECE project in 1st year, the English classes, the walks during 2nd year and of late our chats. I regret behaving like a total jerk early on with him but am glad all that is in the past now.<br>     Wishing you all the luck for your future and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br>      </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>A few months back I would have used the words super creative, fab designer or astonishingly calm to describe him but now that I know him pretty well (at least I think I do) I would still use the same words <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Jokes apart, I really enjoy his company because he lets me go on these talkathons and listens to all the crap I say with a lot of patience. Probably the smartest,coolest and most intriguing guy I have met .. I genuinely wish I had got to know him better earlier <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.<br>      We initially bonded over tv shows,movies,music etc and the best part is he one of the very few people who follow OTH (which btw is the bestest tv show ever). Has a very unique taste in music and movies. Trustworthy and understanding, its been great fun being around him and he is an incredibly mature guy. He is extremely talented <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and good at what he does and am sure will achieve immense success in whatever he chooses to do in the future. Will always look back on our walks and chats with a lot of fondness and one thing that will always make me smile is how unintentionally nerdy he can get at times <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . Had a lot of fun during the salsa workshop and the Dj nite during Felicity, and dude why we dont win a tv show quiz beats me!!! The strangest thing is ever since he started following a bit of football, Liverpool<br>have been doing exceptionally well!!! Points of contention : he likes Nadal and hates Kareena. Have been trying to change his opinion for some time now but have failed.I aint giving up tho ! <br><img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>There are lots of other things I respect and admire him for but he knows all that .Your an awesome friend and just overall an awesome guy. Wishing you all the luck for your future and tons of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;<br> He was one of the first guys to come and talk to me in the first year and I remember our conversations back then revolved around interaction sessions,<br>     Gowtham,Agni <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> etc. He has been a true friend through and through and I will always remember him for his honest advice which has helped me many times.<br>     He can be really sensitive at times and thats why I value our friendship a lot because it is very genuine and heartfelt. <br><br>           We became close during our BTP and I can never forget how tensed we would get before every viva and yet manage to 'manage' <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. He is a very good <br>   athlete and cricketer. Sings well too and I cant help but smile when I think of the group song performance in the 1st year for Agni where Spandana and I <br>totally re-mixed a classical song <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He is surprisingly broad-minded and forthright in his opinions and never shys away from helping out a friend.<br><br>         I hope our friendship continues although you will be all busy in LPU <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Good luck for all your future plans and I will miss you a lot <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;<br><img src=Smileys/24.gif /> I think its only apt to start this testimonial with a lol because that is what happens when you meet KD. Perhaps the funniest,wittiest girl I have ever met and a delightful company, she is someone who approaches things with a carefree attitude that I can only appreciate <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. We used to speak a lot in the first year but somehow our conversations shifted to a casual smile or a hi during the second and third years. But we have more than made up for all those lost conversations this semester and all those chats have been extremely funny and personal at the same time!! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>      She has these unique facial expressions alongwith the most sarcastic of tones and if there ever were a female Chandler, it would be her. Will never ever forget that awesome recording session in my room where KD's true talents and tastes came out <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. All the best for your future goals (and I mean the non-academic ones too <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) and loads of love and good wishes <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=lydia.html>Lydia Manikonda</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Contrary to popular belief, Lydu is an absolute fun person in her own unique way <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. As much as I admire her for her sincerity and ethics, her obsession for cleanliness (she could give Monica a complex) and animated movies (esp Kung fu panda <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) always ends up becoming a point of debate!! I have been trying to get her to watch a movie in a cinema for 4 years without any success. I give up Lydu <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>     Will fondly remember the awesome walks and talks, doing assignments(at least that's what we intended to do <img src=Smileys/4.gif />) in your room, slumber partys, birthday bashes etc for a long time. Her internship period in Australia kinda transformed her and shes become much more relaxed and outgoing now. A patient listener,caring pal and discipline preacher <img src=Smileys/3.gif />, Lydu you are a wonderful person, a wonderful friend and am sure will become a wonderful teacher too <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. All the best for your future plans and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=anupama.html>Anupama Gali</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the sweetest,sensitive and sensible girls, Anu is probably the person who has changed the least from the first year - and I mean that as a compliment <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. My first memories of her are not that pleasant <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> given the fact that she played this really awful song early in the mornings almost everyday which brings me to one of her talents. Shes an awesome singer and has incredible knowledge when it comes to telugu songs... let me rephrase it- incredible knowledge when it comes to mass,item,pakka 90s ke telugu songs <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Things I will remember for a long time are the games we played in several classes, the slightly verging on insane <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> recording session in your room, all the bc we did in the corridors, that special pic <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> with a special someone's something that I had the privilege of clicking <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and just overall the genuine friendship we shared.<br><br>Her simplicity is her biggest strength and I am certain that with your hard work,intelligence and commitment you will achieve great heights in life and here's wishing you all the luck for that. Will miss your jokes,songs,support but above all will miss you as a friend who's  always been there. Tons of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sushma or 'Susu' as she has been fondly re-named <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> is one of the most caring and genuine people I know. Hardworking,organized and sincere, she is a friend who will give you sound advice and stand by you as long as you are honest. Getting a tad bit too philosophical for my taste... shifting gears<br><br>Susu can be a riot sometimes. She is great company and I will never forget that day in yucktahaar <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> mess during placements when we laughed for 30 mins at a stretch. She is a romantic at heart coz the music she hears all day long are these slow numbers that have become a trademark in our wing <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. A fellow f.r.i.e.n.d.s fanatic who remembers every single episode and dialogue!<br>   I will always look back on our conversations about life,family and other such casual topics <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> with a huge smile on my face. We have had countless bc sessions in our wing and in classes over games like tollywood (she knows the most crappiest telugu movie names <img src=Smileys/10.gif />),bingo and nmpt! Not to forget certain other games as well <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>Studies have always been her priority but of late walking seems to have become her passion <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. But she is one of the most level headed,understanding and mature girls of our batch and I know she will manage things !!!<br><br>Congratulations on getting into some really good institutes for MS and wishing all the luck in your future. Stay the same and people will appreciate you for the wonderful friend and person you are. I will miss you and loads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Spandy as she is popularly known <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> is one of my bestest friends. She has supported me through thick and thin and I will always love her for being there for me coz I can be a pain sometimes <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. <br><br>      She is a very genuine person who thinks twice before doing anything coz she does not want to hurt anyone. Hardworking, dedicated and loyal, I am sure anyone who meets here will realize that she has a wonderful presence and can be a lifelong buddy. <br>  <br>   Enough praising... Spandy could actually give Chuck Norris a complex. Her jokes (or whatever that is <img src=Smileys/3.gif />) keep us in splits and her creativity is mind boggling. I will remember her for her awesome one liners, the trips to the icecream vendor, playing bingo in practically every class and the list is just endless.<br><br>      I am sure we will have many more fun moments in the future coz we will be working at the same place. Spandy you are the best !!!!! <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the coolest girls around, I did not know her that well in the first two years but now that I know her well enough <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , I think I can safely say that she is a wonderful person who is more than just a stud at acads <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She is a lot of fun and her tweets keep me entertained all the time. <br><br>         Her dedication and willingness to go that extra mile for things that matter to her is a great quality and something I respect her for. From dancing during Freshers 05 to Dj nite Felicity 09 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , our friendship has come a long way and I hope she fulfills all her ambitions and goals because she deserves it. You rock <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>6 years is a long time but it just seems like yesterday when I bumped into Harshi at Gowtham and we have been friends since then. We always end up having great fun when we are together and she is one helluva buddy. Great singer, dancer and imitator. Has an awesome sense of humor and there is never a dull moment when she is around. I admire her for her ability to break the ice in the very first meeting and her dedication to things once she sets her mind on it (eg exercising,singing)<br><br>    She is one hot babe now and thanks to her I got serious about exercising too! There are so many cherished moments that we have shared for instance : dance practice sessions during felicity, going out for movies like Anthony Kaun Hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , playing antakshari and dumbC etc etc. <br><br>    I am still gonna come and meet her and irritate her with all my problems because believe it or not she can give good advice .. smtimes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Truckloads of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;<br>A true friend, super-committed to her house <img src=Smileys/41.gif />, fab athlete and one of the most responsible girls around. As friends we have had our share of ups and downs but I think that has made our friendship stronger. Will always remember the times when we saw horror films in her room with eyes half covered, planned on studying and ended up gossiping <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , went out on long walks and more recently drives <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. All the best for all your future plans <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and tons of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif />.</b></i></ul><br><br>
