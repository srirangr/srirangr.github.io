<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I didnt know much about him until Felicity. From the bits and pieces collected from common set of people whom we know, I came to know that he drinks and smokes a lot. Then came Felicity, when things really changed. It was Day 1 Felicity and I had assigned him some work as he was a part of hospitality club and I had an event to organize. My personal opinion about him during those days was - this guy talks a lot and didnt work. And the same thing happened, he didnt finish the work assigned to him but there was a reason. I was really annoyed and didnt bother to know the reason. I even remember what I had told him in the phone "Dude, If you cannot do work, why do you take up responsibilities?". I am really sorry for what I had done. In fact the entire day and even night, he was taking care of a bunch of jacka**' from the Indian Ocean band. (Long story, ask Adi to narrate the story on why Indian Ocean is a bunch of jacka**'). Day 3 I met him again and thats when he narrated me the series of incidents that happened and I wish I had said sorry that day for what I had done. The patch up part will be the most memorable moment for me during Felicity when you drew Indian map on the ground, divided it as north and andhra and finally rubbed the line of demarcation. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>Then came holidays and that was the first time I came across his blog. It was a post about your trip to Himachal Pradesh. The way he wrote that post left me completely mesmerized. He takes his readers to some different kind of world (Utopian) .I always said him wish I could write like you some day. I hope some day you write a book and I promise I will be there in the queue like many others who love your style of writing, waiting for you to sign on the copy of your book. Its been a great experience knowing you, reading your posts and doing BC with you. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Tag : Sports, Social Activities, BC, IIIT Mag, Felicity, Marathon, Blog</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;<br>If by any chance the shakti machine in LTRC wing gets damanged, they will replace it with Shiva Reddy - the Shaktimaan of IIIT-H. <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> Came to know more about him through YV Sandeep. Both were/are/will be certified geeks working on some hacking tricks, reading some tech blogs and linux freaks. He helps everyone/anyone anytime without expecting any kind of favor from the other side. Has been very helpful during the first phase of placements when there was a shortage of volunteers. I am sure lots in store for you in IIIT Hyderabad and one day you will surely be a well known researcher. Be the same.<br><br>Good luck! <img src=Smileys/77.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=harshita.html>harshita</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour.<br>I'll be there for you, like I've been there before.<br>I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too.<br><br>She eats lots of sweets so she sings sweet. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Banga Sahb is simple, down to earth and always helpful. I have never seen him shout at anyone or use a bad word. Is simply brilliant at what he does. Any given situation if you need an optimal solution, Banga is there for you <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> like he is been there before <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. It was a learning experience for me to conduct placements along with you. The way you tackled situations, managed not to lose patience when interacting with GAG .. wow! just amazing <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. We have still lots of work to be done - both Samvedana and Placements and I am sure with you being as one of the leading hands, it should be a cake walk. <br><br>Wishing you loads of success.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=knvrreddy.html>Rama Reddy KNV</a></b>&nbsp;<br>King Reddy/Rama Reddy/Banda Reddy/Banda Reddy Erra Cheddi/Local from Kukatpally/Reddy (as I call him)<br><br>Me: Arey neeku Old city telusa? Aanta naa area. Call me Khan.<br>Reddy: Local alias Ramareddy from Kukatpally<br><br>This is how we introduced ourselves in the first year. I must have spent millions of hours interacting with him on some non sense topic. He and Goutham (the perfect Laural Hardy pair) can go on and on and on .. they never run out of topics. And we three form the perfect sollu buddies. He is super intelligent. He sleeps in the class most of the time but still manages to get an A. Once a cockroach tried entering his room, but unfortunately it could not bear the smell of his room and died. From this we concluded that the scent of his room can be used to manufacture cockroach killing drugs. But it was worser than that. It even kept away humans and gottams from entering in his room. This lead to further conclusions that he is well know in kukatpally area for genocide acts and gets most of the chemicals from his room. <br><br>Its was great knowing you. Touch lo vundu.<br><br>In the name of all those cockroaches that died in your room. Amen! <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=kgoutham.html>goutham</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Gottam - [Def] After Homosapiens, the next set of species that invaded the Planet Earth.<br><br>Though is five feet some odd no. of inches tall, he is quick, spontaneous and hits a lot. I must be the only person in IIIT-H who is scared of him. Rest of the gang calls him baccha - battu baccha and what not. He is one of this guys who had this major transformation from being a geek to a super cool guy. He claims that he plays AOE without cheatcodes, but sadly one day he was caught on Reddy's cam (This according to us was the first scandal of IIIT-H. I know it sounds LAME, but it was fun back in those first year days). Room no. 347 NBH - so many memories associated with that room, it was a third home for me. Got the best view of the swimming pool from that room but unfortunately never got "the best" (you-know-what view I am talking about) view when I was around in his room, though he again claims that he seen lots of good things from that window. A total Gaming/Anime/Movie freak.<br><br>Good luck. Wishing you loads of success <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I got to know more about him only during Felicity. Rest of the time it was only commenting at blogs and greeting whenever we met accidentally. It was he who had inspired me to blog and I sincerely thank you for doing that <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.Undoubtedly of the strongest pillars of Felicity 08 and yes we did set standards which cannot be broken so easily. Remember the night before Felicity - You, Me, Chand, Harsha, Pagare we were all on the stage that was being set, trying to predict all the possible outcomes of Felicity 08. Though Felicity 08 didnt have any major sponsor, Maroo had brilliantly planned the entire Felicity 08 with the limited budget was available. And the outcome was maximum celebrations, highest level of bonding, bringing out abilities of the batchmates and various other things that brought a +ve wave throughout the batch. I wouldnt have recognized my managerial skills (which I still need to work on) had it not been you who had trusted in me and given me responsibilities. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. One person whom I would love to consult for an opinion be it in any field - acads, career etc. Lots has been told about his acads, his abilities. For me you are a superhuman (after Felicity, before Felicity you were <img src=Smileys/26.gif />).<br><br>Good luck and wishing you loads of success. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=spandana.html>Spandana</a></b>&nbsp;<br>The most creative girl of our batch. She is frank and helpful. Your jokes are simply superb <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. If you ever plan to write a book on your jokes, I would love to be the co-author. Remember we had a chat of robbing BoA. Now that we have many new entries, I am thinking of writing the script again. In the mean time you decide on the casting crew. Oceans 7 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> will surely be a big hit. Thanks to Samvedana that I came to know more about her.<br><br>You raack girl!<br><br>Good luck with you future endeavors.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;<br>It was third year second sem when I had first spoke to her (one of those MBA classes if I am not wrong). Before that most of the conversations took place only through blogging. She writes some real good stuff and any post of hers you can easily expect a double digit no. of comments. You can speak to her on any topic, "any". Just to name a few - WWE <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> (Undertaker is Legendaaaaary!), Cricket, Football (Liverpool - Gerrard - Torres = My school football team), Tennis (Federer it is!),TV shows (Gossip Girls - somebody kill me), Music. I think we must have covered almost every section of a newspaper in the conversations that we had. I was the first one to break the news of her being placed in BoA (get to do that very often) and my ears went deaf for a moment.<br><br>Good luck with BoA and if you ever plan to rob your own bank you know whom to contact first <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Thanks for the bday cake and do invite me regularly - "cake ke liye hum kuch bhi kar sakte hai" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Right arm fast bowler over/around the wicket, faculty quarters end. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Eat Cricket, Sleep Cricket and Drink Cricket - thats Rohit Bhardwaj. One of the best persons I have met during my stay at IIIT Hyderabad (thanks to Srikar that I came to know him and his group). He speaks well and gives some awesome/amazing ideas when asked for. Provokes the minds of the person on the other end (makes the other person think). I strongly believe he should pursue his career in politics. He keeps pointing at the loopholes in the present/past government systems and gives his opinion on tackling those issues - which fits in properly. With your presence in team-samvedana, I am sure we can reach heights quickly. An all-rounder in both Cricket and Engineering. Had the raccha moments of my life in NBH in organizing Felicity and attending Bday treats.<br><br>People say we look like brothers <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Anyways Good luck with your future endeavors. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of my super cool friends. His Hyderabadi lingo makes me go LOL + ROFL + MAO most of the times. You are so funny Maruti <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>He was the first one to introduce me to social networking (I felt honored when you made me the owner of IIIT Hyderabad community <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). He is the first one to start blogging in our batch <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and that one spark was good enough to get many of us close and to be popularly known as 'Bloggers' Batch' <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. He shares some awesome links in Google Reader (tech+humrous+flashy images <img src=Smileys/10.gif />+regular tests <img src=Smileys/21.gif />). He really works hard when it comes to something that is close to his heart. Happens to be well known hacker to the outside world (some guy, when I said I am from IIIT, the first thing he asked me was do you know Maruti? I was like <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />). Apart for that he is brilliant at coding, and has won good number of competitions. He has put a decent effort in reducing weight. Applause baby! <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>We share similar interest - Ferrari fans, Megan Fo<img src=Smileys/14.gif />y), Kamat Resturants <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Dont go to Bangalore. Gangstas will surely miss you <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=hvbansal.html>Harsh</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Harsh<br><br>Room no. 193<br>Harsh : [Shouts] Adi yaar mera PC nahi chal raha hai<br><br>Room no. 191<br>Prateek : [Wakes up suddenly] Alarm bajj gaya <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Just Kidding. Harsh a.k.a HVB is intelligent, sharp, quick and very good decision maker. He is highly focused. He is the only person in IIIT who can read and understand Sanskrit. (Respect) <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. A well planned guy and knows why/what/how he is doing it(the work that he takes). He loves traveling. Always spotted with his cell phone, with his neck bent (30 degrees) talking softly with someone <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Was a part of several lead roles and never backed out of any. Thanks for the lovely kurta present that you had presented to all our winges. Your mom makes amazing chocolates and I will miss them for sure. (recepie pass kar denna). <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Good luck with your future endeavors. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Ranga a.k.a DJ Ranga a.k.a Ranjalkar a.k.a Ringa-Ranga a.k.a Sri Ranga a.k.a DJ a.k.a Cuty (as girls call him) OMG! so many names <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, but you totally deserve them.<br><br>If I ever happen to create a music system, I will name it after you (DJ da promise).<br>If I ever happen to become a cab/7seater driver, I will name my music system as Ranga Remix Audio System.<br>If I ever happen to start my own music industry, I will name it Ranga Series audio.<br>If I ever happen to take part in an antakshari event, I will name my team as Ranga <br>If I ever become a DJ in my life, I would love to be called as DJ Lil' Ranga <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br>If I ever start an entertainment channel, I would call it Ranga Manoranjan <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Mr Smiley, ever friendly, bindaas attitude thats Srirang for me. I had loads and loads of fun hanging out with him. Please be the same, so that my wish list doesn't get disturbed <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Jai Maharashtra! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mbchowdary.html>Bhargava Chowdary M</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Bharghav a.k.a Bee a.k.a Bakki a.k.a Bhargova the Casanova<br><br>Friends right from Day 1. Very calm, used to listen to every class and make regular notes. I really dont know how he could bare us (me,prudhvi and sharat - a total PIA trio) at his back constantly discussing some arbit topic. We share a common set of friends (apart from the IIIT friends) and that's how our discussions used to begin the first year days. It was in first year, and everyone was given html assignments. His was one of the best designs that I had come across (though it had pink color <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and he has lived upto that expectation even today. First year days was total fun - with me, bharghav, ramreddy and goutham talking some arbit crap, watching DBZ (I never liked it).<br><br>He has worked really hard to reach what he is today - undoubtedly the best designer in college. He is one of those guys who loves working on out of the box ideas. I was annoyed at him once (Felicity Tee Design) but I respect for what you had done at that point of time.<br><br>Wishing you loads of luck and hope you come out with flying colors <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=richeek.html>Richeek</a></b>&nbsp;<br>TAMU awaits TAU <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br><br>Richeek a.k.a Tau a.k.a Dicheek<br><br>One has to listen Richeek speaking in Hindi to know more about him. He is so fluent with his language and the words that he uses fit in so comfortably - I wish I could speak like him. His knowledge about Mythology is immense. Brings out really good informative points whenever he is in a debate (esply the one with Khurana and Harsh on the opp. end). His sense of humor is something I fall for. Though he tries really really hard (jogs,goes to the gym) in order to have six-packs, sadly his tummy isn't ready to lose the family pack. The only reason why Dominos is making profits is because the contributions made by Richeek Arya and Bharat Sanklecha (BTP partners). Their desire for Cheese Bust <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> is never ending and the offers Domions makes is also never ending <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Apart from that he is good at what does. Very helpful in nature and is always concerned about the society he lives in.<br><br>Will surely miss you <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>I always get a grin on my face when I hear his name (its called the DCH effect). Roll number 200530001 (#1), Btech ECE. Looks very very (... very ->infinity) innocent, but mind you looks are deceptive <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . He is a total food freak. He is a total phodu saala when it comes to Coding. I wish he was in CSE, I am sure you would have reached heights easily. Any Felicity event which has Puzzles in it, Akash's name will always be found in the winners list. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He is too good at solving them - probably he should write a book on puzzles after having solved so many. Has kept us entertaining with the you-know-what he downloads. He gets lots of food stuff when he comes from home (I love Mathura ke peda). He is our group ka event manager. He plans the trip so well that he leaves no room for error. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>One person who has been very proactive during the placements. Thanks for those tutorial sessions that you had conducted. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=adi.html>Aditya Singal</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Punjab da Puttar a.k.a Muscle Man<br><br>Hai Muscular,<br>Hai Popular,<br>Hai muscular, Hai popular, Spectacular, He's a Bachelor (with MS degree)<br><br>But, Adi can't Dance Saala <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>And the reason he gives us why he avoids dancing is - Kings usually dont take part in dance events. Rather they love watching others dance. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>He is sweet guy and offers help anytime you buzz him. His knowledge about movies is amazing. I love his DVD collection - He has been doing it right from the first year. The best movie critic if you ask me. He has read number of comic strips and watched millions of cartoon shows. He grasping power is immense. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I had fun working with him during a course project but ultimately both got a C <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (but hume kaam tho kiya yaar) .Be the same and dont change. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>You can just keep talking to him and never feel bored. He is well known for his PJs. Speaks innocently whatever comes to his mind. His mood swings a lot and that's something I really like about him - totally unpredictable. Amazing story narrator but the stories are a bit geeky. I just love his blogging style. Loved your "series of fortunate incidents in Bangalore" post. I still keep reading it whenever I find free time. Is so creative at times, leaves me dumbstruck. He knows these awesome hangout points which no one has ever been before. Thanks to the Quiz Club I came to know more about him. Just too good when it comes to quizzing <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Any college event would be incomplete without you. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Thanks for being such a wonderful Friend. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> So when are we coming to your place for Lunch? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Deepti G(ji)<img src=Smileys/1.gif /> or Deepti GP(like F1 GP) <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>She is intellegent, smart, extremely talented, adaptive, dreams big(really big) and strong (hai muscular hai popular spectacular <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). She has this unusual machine through which she creates time.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I really dont know how you find time for so many activities but its simply superb the way you manage things. She gives the person talking to her an extra degree of freedom, which makes the conversation really smooth. She is a complete freak when it comes to Image Processing and her work is outstanding. She is such a good listener (Tell her some dialogue of Friends and she can tell you from which episode that dialogue is <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Even Marta Kauffman and David Crane would do that <img src=Smileys/77.gif />). Her dedication to the work she takes is truly amazing. She keeps on working (on and on and on ...) until she is satisfied with what she is doing.  <br><br>For the first two years of engineering she belong to a band called 'kasi cat dolls' but due to some differences among the band members (just like any popular band), she left the band. She is super/uber/ultra cool person to hangout with and hits these awesome one-liners. Her sense of humor is something I really like about her. She loves commenting on everything she sees - (movie posters, couples being spatted, fat drivers/guys, some random guy on the road, shop names ... its a long list). She has this huge crush list but its divided by parts (only she can understand what it means) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. By the way she is a shopping freak! Sometime I think she can read minds (are you from Planet E?). <br><br>I sincerely respect her a lot, be it the initiatives you take or the decisions you make(wow! that was rhyming, I'm improving). Thank you for being such a wonderful person. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=subrotosen.html>Subroto Sen</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Subroto Sen a.k.a Pinky Sen a.k.a BTP Partner a.k.a Subbo a.k.a Frusto<br><br>He speaks his heart and is always crystal clear. He is self composed and relaxed all the time. Never seen him lose temper expect for a couple of times. If he really likes something he works his a** off to achieve/understand it. Worked very sincerly for CAT and even helped me out at times. I had great fun working with him especially the BTP project. Instead of going for an internship in summer we decided to stay back at IIIT Hyderabad and continue with our BTP work. We had done an extensive research work on "chickipedia.com" - a wiki about women apart from the BTP, got people involved in estimating figures and had mastered at the art of figure estimation. The fun I had with his Orkut/Gmail account was totally awesome (Made him join Bengali Aunties Community in Orkut, abrupt messages like "Hi .. I got placed .. ok bye" sent to the girls in his friends list, etc). The only problem that I faced with him was his laziness but he is working on it. A total food freak and has got all the traits of a typical Bengali Guy. <br><br>Wishing you great success at Samsung. Bhallo!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=yogendra.html>Yogendra Umesh Itankar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Yogendra a.k.a Yogi a.k.a Yogata a.k.a Motu a.k.a Hasmukh<br><br>Undoubtedly he was a Dawg! in his previous life.(This part of the story will be explained later)<br><br>The cool dude of IIIT Hyderabad. Down to earth and simple living - two things which Yogi believes in. His mind is made up of clay - anyone can mould it. For instance in the morning he might be supporting your opinions, but by the time its evening he could be on the other side. I cannot forget the innumerable number of discussions that I had with him. His knowledge about Signal Processing is turly awesome <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.  Wake him up any point of the day and give him a problem, he is always there with a solution. Thanks for taking those useful tutorial sessions during placements. A lot has been told about Yogi's activities/goof-ups, but those are some of the best moments captured during my stay at IIIT Hyderabad. I had great fun hanging out with you and I'm surely gonna miss you. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>Now coming to the Dawg! part. Like Al Pachino could smell women in the movie "The Scent of Women", similarly Yogi can smell food. His sniffing range can be around 10m radius. Its an impossible task to hide food from Yogi's sight. He has a strong affinity towards Murgi. Plays TT and Football; Drinking Tea; Washing Clothes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />; are some of his favorite hobbies. <br><br>Wishing you loads of luck. Hope you get through IISc Bangalore become bald some day <img src=Smileys/21.gif />. </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=nitinjain.html>Nitin Jain</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Its been three and half years since I know this guy. As rightly pointed out by Shashank, he is a man of principles. He has got an immense controlling ability power. He has taken all the tough courses that are available in ECE <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> and scored well. Is very popular amongst the professors. Any process/task that he takes up he always looks up at the long term gain of that task/process, which I sincerly appericate about him. Hats off to his coordinating skills. The way he has run Yuktahaar undoubtly no one could match those standards. I remember the times when he used to share the problems he used to face in decision making - which were for the benefit of Yuktahaar but again opposed by some people. He has been really helpful throughout my acads and I owe a lot to him. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Enough of good things about Ninja, now let me talk about the other side of Ninja.<br><br>Though he looks thin, but as far as I know he is a wanna be <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Batista. He does a lot of ramp walk in our wing. He starts opening his shirt buttons when he is at the wing entrance, walks slowly (matak matak ke chalna) and finally ends up at someone's door. Then he shows his muscles to that very unfortunate/fortunate <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> person, gives some wrestler poses and walks back to his room. I'm still trying to figure why he does that <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . He has got a variety of cosmetic collection - face pack, creams and what not. If you ever want to invite Ninja to a party, please inform him 30mins before you leave. (The avg time taken by Ninja to do the makeup stuff is 30mins). His room is the best hangout point in our wing. Any gossip session/movie that is meant to be screend for the entire wing has to take place in his room (rule no.1). His place has got 24hr food supply, but one has to be really very clever to find it. His flirting tricks suck big time.<br><br>Thank you for being such a wonderful friend. It was a learning experience having you as a friend. Be the same and try to bring some change in your eating habits. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=mksharma.html>Manish Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;<br>My neighbour/enemy/friend/brother/advisor. Speaks straight forward and the way he speaks is just amazing. He goes on and on and on .. and on. Over the years he has shown tremendous change in his behaviour. In the first year, every sentence of his ended with a beep sound instead of a full stop. Every person was addressed as a beep person. Then came summer holidays when he had accidentally used the beep word at home, and realized he had to cut down the usage of beeps. In second year he did nothing except for Graphics course. He created a solar system, an aircraft simulation, spun it clockwise then anti-clockwise, zoomed in and out and showed it to every person who passed by his room. <br><br>A nocturnal species. He has even put up a decent effort in learning Telugu. He can sing songs from Bommarillu and Garshanna. I had great fun watching telugu movies with him (starting with Ghajini(T)). He tried playing CS (Nick : Teri Maut) and unfortunately people read his nick properly and gave him what he deserved. Then he started played AOE and I can say he is a decent player when it comes to AOE (judging this only on the amount of shouting that you do while playing the game). <br><br>Gets agitated very easily. It was sometime during the first year and Subroto had called him 'Cheddi'. Mux was so pissed off that he went to Prof Mitra and complained about Subroto to him <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  He is very helpful (can be clearly seen from what others have written). His DB when is comes to Hindi songs is good. When we were in NBH, I remember we had a contest called NBH Idol (Of course there were only 3 participants - Me, Manish and Mahaveer). Sadly Manish was bowled out in the first round. He is so good at handling accounts that sometimes I feel he should have taken up Accounting as his career option rather than chosing Computer Science <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> He had even offered me to teach me C/C++ when it came to placements and still keeps doing that. <br><br>Thanks for extending Year Book deadline <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and for being such a great friend. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Pee Sharat Chandra a.k.a  PSS  a.k.a  P(i)SS  a.k.a  Konda  a.k.a  Neuron  a.k.a  P Triple S. <br><br>It was the first working day in our college and it started with general conversation - AIEEE rank, School, IIT. And when it came to Sharam Coaching - Sharat "Stop I say! Arey mama Srinu ra <img src=Smileys/77.gif />" (a typical sharat expression). And then the discussion continued day after day; Any random topic any class we didnt really bother what the Prof was teaching. Sollu was our prime objective. Joined by our very own local celebrity Prof Prudhvi Vatala (Om Sai Ram!) we had gala time in the first year. He has got great analytical thinking power. He help a lot in my physics course which was way over my head. Prof Mukku used to just keep on writing text/symbols on the board which wasnt a familiar lingo. Only Sharat used to nod his head. Twam mahan ho <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>Then came first year Quiz Club. It had phodu members like Satvik, Samaba, Aseem, Arun amongst the seniors and Sharat was the only one who opened his mouth when it came to Juniors <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Best moment in 2nd year was during course feedback time. Sharat was so pissed off at LA course that he decided to write a one page write up about the professor's way of teaching and the course, got few printouts, distributed them to the junta and asked them to staple it along with the feedback.<br><br>A total food freak and enjoys to the fullest whatever he eats. You can call his tummy a Garbage Can. Apart from that he enjoys Programming, Wiking, Doing Weird Stuff, Quizzing. Day Dreamer and ever smiling face - that's Sharat for me. Standard "eeeeee" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> (Happy Dent White moment) expression when it comes to giving a pose for a photograph.<br><br>Ask me to pick one person who has got out of box thinking ability - Sharat would be first one in my mind (Followed by Scientist). A lot has been said about his work during Felicity 08 <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Good luck with your plans. You raack mama! Stay away from "the chick" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Will miss you at times when there is excess food in my room <img src=Smileys/21.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;<br>[contd]<br><br>He has always been helpful throughout my B.Tech. Kind at heart and never really took personal credit when it came to team projects (even if he was the only one who had worked on the project). He helped a lot during Felicity days, when I was bundled with loads of work. A great team player and is always on huge demand whenever some project pops out. He goes to the gym every day, but sadly wasn't able to defeat me when it came to arm wrestling. He is the co founder of IIIT Hyderabad Fight Club (coming soon, location - new building).<br><br>Memorable moment: Felicity 09 Rock Show, EW Final Project<br><br>Triva: Till the time I was his roommate his CGPA was 8.something and after that it went to 9.something <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=akkarthik.html>N Anantha Krishna Karthik</a></b>&nbsp;<br>N Ananth Krishna Karthik (formerly known as NA Karthik a.k.a Sodium) is a geek kid of IIIT - H. I had met him first when I was in class 10 (Sharma Coaching). We used to sit in the last bench and were the best sollu buddies. He was the first person to get a slap (which will go down into the history books of IIT foundation classes) from Srinu Sir - a psycho lecturer who was known for his awesome jokes. He isnt that sincere people. He used to bunk classes when he was in Mega Study Circle. He used to throw his bag from 3rd Floor to the 1st Floor and then run away from the 1st Floor. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Then I met him during AIEEE counseling session. He was still the same - a geek kid. Fortunately/Unfortunately both of us joined electronics department at IIIT Hyderabad. First year half my C/C++ code used to come from him and the rest half was original <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> After observing his dedication towards his work he was given the title of 'A kasi karthik'.  He follows football and is a core Chelsea fan, but he does not play well when it comes to the field play. (BTW Chelsea Sucks! Join Arsenal). His favourite hobby during the first eyar days was to install Windows XP in his Dabba PC.<br><br>Second year was fun watching FRIENDS. He plays AOE and FIFA exceptionally good. Aggressive tactics and a strategic player are the key words that describe his game play. I must have defeated him once or twice not more than that. Slowly from A Kasi Karthik he transformed into Baba A K. I remember I had tough times during exams when people used to come for darshan every morning just before writing exams. <br><br>[contd]</b></i></ul><br><br>
