<b><a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ojas ...a real nice guy . In the beginning of college, I had an impression that he is an attitude showing guy. But when I came in touch with him, I realized he is one of most friendly, sincere, fun loving, childish and mature guy. His looks and his nature is quite opposite. Bat bat me senti ho jata hai or physics lagane lagta hai, so most of the becomes a victim when he is in our group . He is totally gaming freak. Whenever I went to his room, most of the time I found him playing EOA, CZ n... blah blah . A regular gymer and also Sincere for studies..  (sometimes not) . He is also a literature lover hv written so many nice poems, which u can find him on his blog  .<br>Goa trip with him was really awesome. So many memories of Goa are still fresh in my mind. Hope we'll have many more in coming future. He is a Dad's boy . Quite sentimental for his parents, hv so many dreams for them. I wish ur all dreams come true very soon. All the best for ur future. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>

Now that you are in Microsoft I bet you could get game titles for much cheaper price than in Market. Hoping to try out WWE, Tekken, Street Fighter, DC vs Mortal Kombat, Gears of War, and other co-op and multiplayer game with you in future.<br>	I really appreciate and thank you for your offer on sharing a house with you. All the best for you future @ Microsoft and I know we will be in contact for years to come.<br><br>Signing off ... Kiran Danduprolu</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>[Part 2 of 3]<br><br>Timeline of Games we have played together:<br>1)AOE --- 2nd year along with Sachin, Somani, Kulbir and others<br>2)CS --- 2nd,3rd and 4th year along with Many batchmates<br>3)Marvel Trading Card Game --- 3rd Year --- One of the most awesome gaming experiences that I have ever had -- there was nothing much to do but The strategies, teams, decks .... ah I miss this game a lot.<br>4)Civilization IV --- 3rd Year --- I knew this was the best Strategy game ever and Ojasvi gave it a shot and guess what he agreed with me and he was addicted to it too. Then we started playing this in multiplayer mode too against Computer. It was also fun as I used to concentrate on development while Ojasvi showed his commandereal skills in trying to attack the Comp.<br>5)Titan Quest --- The Diablo Style game which I initially disliked caught Ojasvis interest and he asked me if I would play it with him and I agreed with very small hope but multiplayer in Titan Quest made my opinion change on the game and we completed the game together in multiplayer mode.<br>6)Diablo II --- Completed Diablo II in multiplayer mode along with him in 4th year almost 1 week back <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>7)World of Warcraft --- I was a WOW addict back in 3rd year and asked Ojasvi to join as it was a MMORPG and it was the only opportunity in college we would get to try MMORPG. Ojasvi too liked the game but was quick to realise that it was damn addictive and tried to avoid the game and only played it when I was with him.<br>8)Warcraft III Dota<br>and many more small games including pocket tanks.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kirand.html>Kiran Danduprolu</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ojasvi is one of the most special friends I have ever had. I dont remember when we first met in IIIT and how ever friendship began but I really thank God for having sent Ojasvi to IIIT with me. Whenever I and Ojasvi come together other friends start running away as they know we will talk about Games,Games and Games and there will be no scope for BC around. Ojasvi is dedicated and feels responsible and hence manages his time to have a balance between gaming, tv shows, studies etc. He does all his work on weekdays and does full Gaming on weekends. Ojasvi is one of the few lucky ones who has been placed in Microsoft this year and I bet he will climb the ladders there much quicker than others do.<br>	I and He have together played numerous PC games multiplayer on LAN ... I bet none would have even heard of these games. We share common gaming interests and thats why we get along so quickly in multiplayer.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=yogesh.html>Yogesh Prakash Nautiyal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>When I met him for the first time, I was like - wow, whoz that guy with such a stange but friendly accent. Laughing and talking both at the same time. From the very first instant I began to like this person. I rem our first talk revolved around my AIEEE rank. Actually he was kind of searching thos guys who were top ranker in IIIT. So we met...and this guy poured all the metaphors of appreciation in my legacy ..bond, phodu, genious, newton ..so on <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Well thats Ojas for you...He lend his whole heart out for you. <br>In first year I knew him as a guy who is a game freak..and want to play all available games. We were in diff section and hostel, so I was not opportune enough to have spent much time with him quite often. But whateva few chatting sessions we had were very interesting. Quite often our talks involved with life around, to our hometown and family. And he was the person with so much of experience.<br>He is one of the few person at IIIT whom I admire most. I admire him for his self-belief, attitude. He had clearly set out goals with which he landed in IIIT. Doing good at study and getting a handsome package is okay, but to chill, and live this college life was also his priority. And he indeed accomplished the set out things. Got his  dream job in Microsoft. Besides he added all the possible spices in this college life. So passionately hit the gym, has lost the oodles of weight and has grown into a hunk. I don't know much about his girlfriends but I am sure there must be many wooing around him. In college itself he is so famous among batchmates, and juniors too.<br>I enjoyed the trip with you in Goa...and in future also I will be looking fwd to such trips. And dude I know you will rock where ever u go. All the very best for your future.<br>I will certainly miss you..but being cities apart I dont think there will be distances between our heart. *Friends Forever* </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=manisharora.html>Manish Arora</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ojasvi aka Dark_knight<br><br>Apna hisari bhai hai ye to. I met this guy in my 12th class Physics batch when he was a dropper and freshers' and droppers' batches got merged. That time all of the freshers including me used to call him bhaiya "Ojasvi bhaiya" .... sounds a bit awkward now <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But I must tell you that this guy is a genuine bond in physics. Alag hi level par sochta hai banda. Har cheez mein physics lagane ki koshish karta hai. He is very intelligent and his MS intern and PPO are a testimony to this fact. Gamer to the core. Life ke fundo ke baare mein bahut sochta hai. Jeevan vidya achchi lagti hai bande ko. Chuttiyon mein isliye ghar nahi jata taki jeevan-vidya kar sake <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Keep rocking dude.

<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>The first thing I learned about him was that he knew karate before I learnt his name! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>He is passionate about physics with quantumness in it, and the only person with whom I like to talk about bringing innovation in superhero industry, although our talks haven't reached any conclusion. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /><br>We do discuss our poems with each other sometimes, and sometimes talk about Anime and I watched some suggested by him and they were good.<br>He is passionate about gaming and can spend hours continuously shooting terrorists or managing a civilization and waging a war.<br>He's a BIG fan of Howard Roark and likes to keep himself physically fit.<br>I remember once we were discussing about martial arts and I said that I can not handle pain so I didn't learn martial arts till now, on which he told me what one feels on the first impact of a fist, that everything else feels insignificant, one feels numb and eyes start watering etc. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>On another occasion, I said that if one knows martial arts, one can fight off anyone, on which he said that if you see a man with a gun, run away, martial arts won't work against a gun, must say I had to agree. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>I tried to propose new superheroes to him, but he said such superheroes already existed. <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> We discussed about time travel, teleportation but since I have hardly read anything about them, so he could, based on his knowledge convince me<br>that I wasn't right or wasn't precise enough! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>For some unknown reason we started interacting quite frequently after coming to OBH, i.e., in<br>4th year.<br>What I would like to take from him is his attitude.<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

For most of us, this was the first introduction to this chap.

I guess priorities change in life, and yes, his focus was more on acads later on. Point proved by the Microsoft PPO. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> .

I still remember when we used to give a '90 degrees' salutation to our seniors.. but this incident happened towards the end of 1st semester.. and ojasvi and I had got to know each other quite well..... but one day he is coming from the opposite direction.. and as soon as he approaches me... he bows and makes a complete 90 degrees to me... taking me to be some senior <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> <img src=Smileys/24.gif /><br><br>we hardly let him go alone to any place... and when he goes home there are always some people to accompany him ... <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>yeh sab kuch isko dhyaan nahi rahta but he remembers all the stupid facts for sure.... for in every discussion he brings forth an established fact about the things under consideration.. and everyone gets pissed off ... <img src=Smileys/21.gif />  dude... no one gives a damn to facts and proven statements if fun ceases to exist at the very mention of them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Enough on pulling legs... shud appreciate him for he deserves some <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>He's a highly philosophical being... believes in meditation.. inner strength.. and all that stuff <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br>He's good in academics .. he started working hard from the 2nd year onwards.. and truly deserved the PPO that he got in MS <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br><b>will miss you for</b>for all your random bakar.. your getting excited over nothing... saying things that goes whoosh over our minds.. <br><b>advice</b> plz be more clear when you speak <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/21.gif /> .. rest all you can handle well.... there are so many advices to be given to you though but I think I've mentioned them already <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Have a successful life !!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Ojasvi or dark-knight(as he like himself to be called) is probably the one with whom I shared everything, discuss everything about me and probably one of my best friend around.By Looking at this tall, strong ,bald guy <img src=Smileys/24.gif />, first impression you will get is that he is rough and tough kind of guy, never cares about anything, Jo mann mein aata hoga karta hoga and all that. But the minute you got to know you will know that he is totally opposite of what he looks.He is soft, polite, intelligent and have an attitude to do anything. Has a heart like kid simple and straight.<br>	I met him first at Pankaj's rum. He was extra friendly for a person meeting first time.I first thought this guy is strange <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> but then while playing TT that time we bonded. From then on I think we used to hang-out most of the time. He used to live in GHEB but often comes to cellar for BC and masti. We used to discuss the C-assignments and usually spends most of the time in lab watching movies or something. In labs also we used to sit side-by-side, complete our task at the earliest and den starts our BC there also. He thought me most of the games which I play today. Playing AOE in workspace was real fun. Playing all night and after breakfast sleeping for the day (ofcourse missing all classes <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). Whenever he plays any game or found anything new he come to our room and literally forces us to try/play this things . He sits with you teach you how to play and later plays with you to defeat you <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. He has very bad memory with names and places . <br><br>Continued....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>After 2 years ,he used to call Banga , Ranjeet and he remembered that I am from Vizag <img src=Smileys/14.gif />. Whenever we take bus for going anywhere he is the person we looked if he is on board or not because if we If you leave somewhere he can't come home (Proof: Mehndipatnam Incident where u start walking in other direction <img src=Smileys/24.gif />). When he shifted to cellar, he used to be in our room most of the time (frustrated from loud punjabi music <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ). We didn't used to spend much time since 3rd year (compared to first two yrs) but we always have some quality time spent for the BC and gaming <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.In 4th year we played many games of monopoly and AOE. He plays monopoly with a strategy and lures with many offers which you regret later. <br>	Coming to skills,He knows karate(as he told us <img src=Smileys/3.gif />), sings well, good in argument (difficult to argue with him) and acts pro in leg pulling sometimes <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.Its hard to get things accepted from him once he rejected that. Highly philosphical at times <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Used to shout all the time in discussion forum of first sem. About girls, he is very soft and considers all girls equally beautiful and charming <img src=Smileys/41.gif />. His ideas about girls is very different. Like GKB he is not liked by everyone but he certainly is liked by bunch of girls <img src=Smileys/1.gif />. Coming to acads, he is not hard-working but smart-working <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. He knows that he want to achieve something big and works for dat.He never prepared for MS like others have done but still managed to clear the interview.For us your selection in MS is boon. In summer'08 whenever we were bored, we used to call him and within 10 mts he was there waiting for us in MS gate. We used to play that beach-volleyball ,billiards,foosball etc. for like 2-3 hrs. It was cool and very enjoyable. Congrats for converting that to full time <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <br><br>continued...</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>In movies, I guess we have very similar taste. Although there are exceptions(I still think Rocky is Just OK <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We have watched many movies together. Whenever you are watching a movie with him, he suddenly pause the movie and start explaining you the things as if you were sleeping throughout the movie <img src=Smileys/14.gif />.Fan of all those animes and animated movies. Die-hard fan of "Batman" and "Rocky". He reads batman's comics, watched all serials =, movies of batman series(both animated and otherwise). When comes to comics he is also fan of Dhruv. and he still reads the PDF version of all the Raj comics (Nagaraj, Doga etc.)<img src=Smileys/24.gif />. I think he is the one with which I played computer games in the LAN frequently for all the four years. From AOE to CZ now-a-dayz. Some games will be remembered always.He always listens to you without judging you and gives you his opinion <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> . This is the reason,Whenever I feel like talking or needs a boostup I go to his room. He always cheers you up with the his happy attitude and chillax you from everything. Thanks for keep doing that <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> <br><br>I wish all the best for your future in MS and hope you will find a way to pursue your lifelong goal of achieving Phd in physics which you were crying for since 1st year.  Be in touch always. Will miss you surely <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b><br>Will Miss U for :- Your childish activities, Long discussions , Computer Games. <br>Most Memorable moment : - V for vedentta outing, Walk while raining that night, playing Monopolies, MS outing and many more.<br>Msg for U: -  Think practical all the time and don't eat your words <img src=Smileys/21.gif /><br>Song for U:-  Pappu can't dance saala <img src=Smileys/3.gif /><br></b><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
