Whenever I went to his room, most of the time I found him playing EOA, CZ n... blah blah . A regular gymer and also Sincere for studies..  (sometimes not) . He is also a literature lover hv written so many nice poems, which u can find him on his blog  .<br>Goa trip with him was really awesome. So many memories of Goa are still fresh in my mind. Hope we'll have many more in coming future. He is a Dad's boy . Quite sentimental for his parents, hv so many dreams for them. I wish ur all dreams come true very soon.

Fir 2nd yr me jab kuch log he NBH mess ke regular members bache <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> then I came in touch with him. BC ka main topic hua kartha tha bandiyan <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.  NBH mess se BC ka silsila start hua tha .... or ye badhta he gya . I started spending more time in cellar .... and we became good friends. Usse pehle tak iske or iske stud-aape ke bas kisse sune the <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .

Sirf HSSM cources <br>ko seriously padhta hai.... or bakio ko bhi padhata hai. Double personality  ka jeeta jagta example hai ye. His behaviour depends <br>on the person he is talking to . Sometime he is very sensible and quite and some time totally opposite.  Only a few people r there, to <br>whom he really talks openly. Also a little egoistic. Bandio ke mamle me to Phd hai. Passionate abt novels and movies. And most of the time we ping him for suggesting movies. Some time he is very confident and Some time I hv seen him a little unstable abt his decision but showing <br>confidence to others. When it comes to BC .... bahut bada BCbaaz hai. In my perspective very few persons are there who realize the true meaning of life. Ye na to poore time serious reh kar bitane ke lie hai .... na he poore time BC or masti karte hue. He knows how to balance both of these. When to use heart n when to use mind.

I was sitting in room no. 305 with my guardians waiting for admission. I looked behind and saw rajasthan on his mark sheet. Then we talked first time and became roommates. I still remember he asked me that day ..we'll play basketball to increase our height <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . In first 3 years we have spent lot of time together. Pro of leg pulling , and I used to be a default victim for him <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> . He is really sincere for studies. First 3 years he used to be very regular for classes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, but 4th yr me most of the time ghar bhag jata hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Bahut logo ko padhaya hai isne. He doesn't look sporty but one of the most sports activists of our batch. So has been a member of batch cricket n football team. He was the first one, who got a laptop in our group. To room me almost daily movie screening hoti thi <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Playing pocket tank, Rodrash in early days was so much fun <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .Banda room ko ekdum saaf rakhta hai.. 1st yr me kabhi mujhe room saf karane ki naubat nahi aayi.

Jab phone ghar par bat karta hai .. then no one can believe that he is d same guy <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .. aisa lagta hai jaise pori dunia me isse sincere banda or koi nahi hai.<br>His behavior changes according to his mood. Kabhi bahut softly bat karega kabhi bahut rude :x .. n a few of times I used to lost my temper due to his rude behavior. He doesn't let himself flow in emotions, knows very well to use his mind.

Both of us had a similar kinda interest in technical side. Learning new things/ languages n technologies became his passion.  Bhai body - builder hua karta tha .. kher abhi wali physique par na jao <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . I remember we used to compare our muscles. He planned many times but hardly came to gym. But you can find eggs, milk , juices or pta nahi kya kya  ....room me dairy khol rakhi hai. Itna khata hai fir bhi sookhta ja rha hai .  Mujhse 2 sal bada hai .. par 2 sal chota lagta hai. Padhai ke mamle me bahut light rehta hai .. meri bhi  tension khtm ho jaya karti thi , iska padhai ki taraf attitude dekh ke. In most of the semesters we took almost same courses. Vigle ne jab mobile liya tha .... to uska camera usse jada maine use kiya tha <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Jab kabhi bhi bahar malls bagera me jate .. to hum dono 'hariyali' dekhne nikal jate <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Bandio ke peeche frushtu hai .... par aaj tak koi nahi mili <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Bhai sahib Punjabi songs or movies ka shauk rakhte hain. Inke accent me bhi punjabi ki feel aa jati hai. Punjab da asar <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . He loves travelling, reading ( <b>'21 ways for becoming millionare' </b> kinda books <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> ) , movies and trying new things in all fields. Ab tak ki sari trips me vigla jarur gaya hai. In the begining he used to speak very less like me .... but now hv improved like me <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Logon ki lene bhi lag gya hai ab to <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> .  He has very calm nature. I hv never seen him angry with someone.<br>He is really honest, fun loving and simple guy. When he takes some work seriously in his hands, he does it with full dedication. Even in the last months of college when everyone is doing BC ,getting nostaligic ....he is doing some work in lab <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> .

Fir outings , coffeshop ke chakkar <img src=Smileys/4.gif />, alok ke room me BC start ho gayi. He is really a hard working guy, believes in himself. Sometimes he lacks confidence, when the matter is serious. <br>As time passed, most of us has changed , fell into groupism , but due to his calm nature he started feeling uncomfortable in this environment, so he is waiting ..ki kab B.tech. khtm ho .. or kab ek nayi life start karu <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .It's good that you haven't change.  Then time came for placements. I think he was one of the very first person, started  prepration for placements. Ise dekh kar he hum logo ne 1-2 mahine pehle prepration start kar di. And I am really thankful to him for that. He loves his past, his hometown ( Gadhwal <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) , his family, his culture.

He is not so caring, but dil ka achha insan hai. Its human nature that someone dislikes anybody due to some reasons ... but I hvn't seen him differentiating with anybody. Either its first time or ... he has been with someone from a long time... his behavior is same for everyone. <br>He is my entrepreneurship/StartUp partner, so working with him I hv realized that he is a hard worker and caring when its related to his future or his ambitions. Atul and Alok kept alive the idea of our startup, when I went to Bangalore. I'm really thankful to them for that. Culturally he is one of the most active persons of college. Banda awesome guitar bajata hai ... dholak bajata hai .... <br>gaata bhi hai, Basketball khelta hai , painiting karta hai... or kya bachhe ki jaan loge <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.

I told him that I need to workout on these things.... he said lets do one thing ..we'll workout together on these .That was the day I came to know abt him ... and we became friends from classmates. We started studying, gyming , roaming , watching movies, BCing together. Most of the time I started spending in his room ... working out on Messenger (That we created <br>out of our interest). 1st yr me kabhi itni bat nahi hui ... bas iski "tere nam" wali hair style yad hai. Julfe latki hui forhead par <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.  Fir exams me sath padhne lage. n After that their was a drastic change in my CG. Thanks to alok <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> .

<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Contd.... -  <br>An incindet I still remember- In felicity'08 we're just roaming around , and watching the event "Kahani me twist" and suddenly we planned to participate.  He is kinda shy guy so later looking at the crowd and <br>professors ( Kamal , Mitra n Sangal ) sir <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , he tried to back out. But somehow I convinced him, and he acted a bihari character so well that we got 1st prize. I could see his confidence after that event. Beech me to shayari start kar di ... bhai kya batau .. kaise jhelte the. <br><br>Also he is one of the founder of our company ( Hope it starts very soon <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ). When I went to Bangalore ... he n Atul continued the work and keep it alive ... for that I thank both of u. <br>He is an ambitious and dedicated for his ambitions. His mind stops working when he do multitasking <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.  Goals of his life changes time to time when he see people doing different things. But Dil ka bahut achha insan hai.. banda heera hai heera.
