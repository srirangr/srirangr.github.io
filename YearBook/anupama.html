<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the few girls I've talked to in the batch. Her roll no. is adjacent to mine, hence was my padosi in class and in workspace.<br>As a coincidence, she, Bhanukiran and I (first 3 roll no.s) shared same workspace PC and also joined CDE, each under diff. professor! <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>She writes phodu poems, simply awesome... her prowess in handling rhyme is one of the best I've ever seen in an amateur poet. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days! But of course we'll be here for 1 more year! <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Anupama.. remember interacting with her during the human value sessions when we were in the same group. Back then, Harshita would keep talking about her. <br><br>Once incident, which I remember, she was coming back from workspace late in the night and I was going there. She had no clue that I could understand a fair bit of Telugu and asked someone (II dont remember who it was), "Where the hell is this guy going at this time?", and I replied back saying, "I know Telugu" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .Rofl incident that!<br><br>I think her poems are very sweet and show a lot of child like innocence in them.<br><br>Wish you all the very best in life!

<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Anups..that is how I call her.. Donno the reason, but I somehow like teasing/irritating this girl <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> She is simple, she is sweet and she is bubbly. I address her sometimes as Miss.Donald Duck, for her cheeks and smile remind me of the latter <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Whenever she talks, her voice hardly even reaches my room which is just diagonally opposite to hers'...after all she should make sure that no one is able to listen to all the gossip she and Divya create in her room <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Just Kidding Anu <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> It always makes me feel that it is some unique trait of this girl which makes her so sweet and very friendly. I also love the way in which she responds to people. She puts in all the respect and politeness she can when talking to someone <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>You can always see this small blush on her face most of the times. And yeah not to forget, you can see this girl bending her head 90 degress down and just blushing and blushing not being able to utter a single word when somebody around her talks about someone so special to her <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I will always remember her father addressing me as "evare aaa dongapilla" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> when she told him that I brought my car to the college and that she too wants one... <br><br>This testimonial would be incomplete if I don't mention about Anu's poetic skills. Her poems are just aswesome... And she has been my inspiration too <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> All the very best Anu <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> Here is a 2-liner for my poem teacher <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Inkentakaalam ee dagudumootalu<br>Aa GopalaKrishnuni munda nee aatalu? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ramya.html>Ramya Yaragani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Anu...Anu...Anu...What can I tell about u. For last few days I have been trying to complete this testimonial, but the moment I finished it, I felt it could have been much better.<br>          Very sensitive has a loving and caring heart. She talks a lot (only on chats <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) and is famous for her witty counters.  Good poet and singer. My first encounter with her was in 2nd sem. I can never forget those days when we traveled back home. Despite of being busy with acads we managed to watch a lot of movies (not only in our new laptops but in Imax). I must mention about our outings ( Indranagar...Dilshuknagar...c/o Gali <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) most of the times we never had a clear plan, just decided whatever we felt on the way.She always had a surprise for me on my B'day. I can still remember the wonderful experience of getting her laptop repaired (Searching for address...Out of service ATMs...insufficient balance...finally philosophy of traffic police adding to Anu's anger...<img src=Smileys/21.gif /> ). Starting from 1st year till today I have many sweet memories only a few captured in pics(<img src=Smileys/2.gif />). Orkut profile which she created for me has both my identity and her memory.<br>	If my Btech has two sides one obviously is acads the other is Anu. I owe her the taste of my first pizza, chat, soup. Book of friendship is always incomplete without a quarrel and misunderstandings. I know that I hurt u so much, but I don't have anything to tell except these 5 letters 'sorry'. It was so ironical that I never realized your importance all these days. You are one of the best chapters in my life's unwritten diary. Knowing my prayers are futile I still wish to have more days in college when I can spend time with u. I miss u ra.<img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=bharadwaj.html>G. Rohit Bharadwaj</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Too childish and too sensitive. The poems are the result of such extreme qualities <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>Cant even bear a minute of leg-pulling and starts abusing(not directly though <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Is fun-loving and equally kasi girl I have come across. Have this unique ability to crack PJ's and thinks that its her sense of humor <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. But yeah, they are good at times but very rarely I must say <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Is instrumental in forming telugu antakshari team which I have not even thought to be part of. We ended up winning third prize that too for "kondababu".<br><br>All the very best,<br><br>cheers,<br>rohit <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>     She herself being a geek, loves people with similar mentalities <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ..She is superbly funny, mindbogglingly creative.. She stumps us with her heart touching poems and writings..<br><br>       Finally, I would like to say - Miss. Anupama, I am one big fan of yours <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All the best for all the academic and most importantly non-academic stuff to achieve <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Love you <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=phanideepti.html>Deepti</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>       Not that this testimonial will bring any bigger grin than that she already has now <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> , I still humbly write what I always feel about this cute girl.. I <b>have</b> to mention the first time we met - it was during AIEEE counseling. Well, I was talking to my cousin <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> and my parents and Anu's parents were sitting side by side..So the parents got into talking and later introduced the kids to each other..I said hi, she said hi... We din't know what to say next... I waited for 10 seconds..Hmmm. no result.. so, I turned towards my cousin and continued the chat I was having <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> Apparently Gali gaaru thought I was rude to ditch her and choose my male cousin over her <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> .. But, I being oh-so-nice liked her at the first instant.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>           Then, we met again, the same day, at some hotel - teendi kosam.. She was going off somewhere and I had to call her, so I called her name.."Anu" I said.. She turned back in fultoo slow motion (with Mohabbatein movie's violin music at the background) and said - "Ma amma tappa nannu ala evaru pilavaru".. I gave a total OMGZZ look and said "Oh, sorry..Anupama" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> .. <br><br>      I also remember the first interaction session we had with our seniors..So scared we were, back then and so chilled out we have become now.. We were very close in the first semester, then we grew out of our cocoons and made new friends, never for once forgetting our friendship.. We have a lot of things in common, we come from similar background, our parents and family are equally sweet and close knitted..You get to share and learn a lot of experiences from people with whom you share a lot of common things <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>        My parents loved her in the first instant and even now every time I go home, my dad keeps asking - "So how is that girl from Vijayawada, she is a very nice girl!"..I am like "Dad, you have no idea  how much she has changed.. You know, she..." <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> Kidding re..<br></b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the sweetest,sensitive and sensible girls, Anu is probably the person who has changed the least from the first year - and I mean that as a compliment <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. My first memories of her are not that pleasant <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> given the fact that she played this really awful song early in the mornings almost everyday which brings me to one of her talents. Shes an awesome singer and has incredible knowledge when it comes to telugu songs... let me rephrase it- incredible knowledge when it comes to mass,item,pakka 90s ke telugu songs <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br><br>Things I will remember for a long time are the games we played in several classes, the slightly verging on insane <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> recording session in your room, all the bc we did in the corridors, that special pic <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> with a special someone's something that I had the privilege of clicking <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> and just overall the genuine friendship we shared.<br><br>Her simplicity is her biggest strength and I am certain that with your hard work,intelligence and commitment you will achieve great heights in life and here's wishing you all the luck for that. Will miss your jokes,songs,support but above all will miss you as a friend who's  always been there. Tons of love <img src=Smileys/6.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>That was about coincidence. Coming to her personality. Anu is a very intelligent person. A very punctual, hardworking <img src=Smileys/77.gif />, smart, dedicated and ambitious girl(enough? or should I flatter more? <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ). After coming to the collge I came to know that she has poetic intrests too. Writes some nice poetry (though I rarely read her poems <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). has a great sense of humor. and is always on the top at pulling others leg right from her childhood days. She's also a girl of her words. It was her birthday and I said I need a party coz I'm your oldest friend and she said Yes. I forgot about that but she personally called me and invited me to the party. <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> I keep asking parties(shamelessly <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> ) for everyone but rarely somebody invites me intentionally. Thanks Anu. That was a great party. A special party is awaiting for you too da. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>She's the one who started the "Ya!" thingy which spread like wildfire in our wing(courtesy: KD and Sharat <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ).<br><br>All the best for your future ya! Hope you be a very successful person and achieve all that you ever wanted in your life. Recenlty came to know about your love. Hope you be successful there too. Well, I'm sure this coincidence thing will keep our friendship alive for many more years to come. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> But still, be in touch.<br><br>And yaeh <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /> for being such a wonderful friend of mine for these many years.<br><br>Dj.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>I met Anu in 5th class. We rarely spoke. She was the most intelligent person of our class. Always stood first in class, ALWAYS <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Any exam, any test same result. We were all jealous of her <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> . Its very difficult to remember anything from those good old days. But there are some instances that I can never forget. She was the one who always monitored the class and most of the times ended up writing my name on the board.(coz I used to do full " <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> " things in leisure periods <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). She gave beautiful greeting cards with nice messages to all the teachers. Back then she was the favorite student of every teacher. <img src=Smileys/6.gif /><br><br>And then when I came to 6th class  she left "Nizamabad". Nobody knew where she'd gone. <img src=Smileys/7.gif /> And that was the time when I came first in the class for the first time. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>In 11th, a statewide IIT-JEE mock-test was conducted and the result was put up on the notice board. That day I saw the name 'Anupama' and I thought Bah! This is not possible. She can;t be the same Anupama I'd known in 5th class. Such things happen in movies only. Once a person lost is lost forever. It can't be true. But coincidence is such a strange thing. It was the same Anu. <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> We still didn;t speak in 11th and 12th and then another strange thing happens. We both come to the same college. Now thats some strange coincidence, ain't it?<br><br>In workspace one day Anu asked me "Are you the guy from Nizamabad?" I said "Hmmm .. yeah!" and ran away.(Thats how I used to be in first year. Idiot. <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> Dumbo types <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) That day I felt that "Oh! At least she remmebers me <img src=Smileys/1.gif />" <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=kdivya.html>K.Divya</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Basically, she is a localite <img src=Smileys/10.gif /><br>She is THE best example for "looks can be deceptive". When you look at this girl, you can't help but believe that she is a very timid and extremely innocent girl (this is mainly because of her super cute lips with a super cuter smile always dancing on them)<br><br>Though this is partly true, there is another side of Anu which not many people are lucky enough to witness. When she pulls off her mask of that innocent version, you can see that fun-filled edition of hers. She has the most awesomest sense of humour. When in her company, you can never feel bored. You don't know how the times flies by when starting chatting with her. The thought that "we have been talking for such a long time" will never cross your mind. Instead you can't help but wonder "have we been for such a long time??!!" and you won't regret it even a single bit. She is a total movie buff (does this word ring any bells anu?? <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). We had, and still have, some great laughs with some dialogues. She is (watch it...not "HAS" but "IS") the biggest telugu songs' database <img src=Smileys/77.gif />  You don't have to even name the song...just give her a few words from it and you can already hear her singing it for you with a wide grin. Also, she has a mind-blowing interest in photos...not taking them but being in them <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> All this doesn't mean that she does nothing but watch movies and listen to songs. She is a girl who is very dedicated to her work. She does all her assignments and project work very sincerely. And she won't breathe peacefully until she finishes her work.<br>And shez got this unique (as she calls it...we call it sth else though <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) taste for guys. She has this major crush on a guy for about 3 years now but is still stuck at the square one.Anu...if you aren't going to act upon it in the next two months, then we, as your friends, have to handle the matter <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br>To sum it up, she is the most wonderful person I met in IIIT and really want to us to be the same friends forever...Love u ya <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=sushma.html>sushma nadella</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>What should I say abt this girl....If I have to write abt this girl proly I have to write whole of  my btech  diary here for she has found place in almost all the pages..Not at all exaggerating <img src=Smileys/1.gif />.But lemme quote few sentences abt her.....very very sensitive ,emotional, sentimental who sticks to her principles be it nething.....Has a gr8 sense of humour and is always the first one to pull my leg..Has given me a great name which became popular over years <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...Likes her family a lot and dedicated to her acads.I have had lots of fun spending time with her...especially when we go home by 217D and stop at abids just to have a look at how McD is doing.... <img src=Smileys/4.gif />.I spend almost half of my time in her room watching movies and the remaining time she spends just surfing 2 important sites(Related to the same  person.....aka  "Desi boy" guess who???  <img src=Smileys/4.gif />).I wish I could mention them here ...but sorry guys she already warned me abt it <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ...But one thing I would like to say is...she admires someone a lot and the admiration levels just taught me how great u have to be to like someone who is not at all moved by all this stuff...hats off to u dear <img src=Smileys/1.gif />..I really hope that person understands it some day...Finally I would say U should be lucky enuf to meet a person like anupama and luckier to be  her friend and luckiest to spend quality time with her...Yipee...I am the luckiest..Thanks for everything...Love u lots dear ...Miss you..</b></i></ul><br><br>
