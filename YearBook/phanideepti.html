<b><a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Have met her only on a few occasions, one while freshers I guess and one while being in the same team in DumbC. But I really admire her for being a good student and also waking up to the call of the need, starting a movement which is on its path for becoming something move. Stories of samvedana are really inspiring. Great work!!<br>All the best for future, I'm sure it'd be much better, although not the same as these college days!</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=ambati.html>Bharat Ram Ambati</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Deepti... final yearlo parichayam ayina one of the good frens. One of the few B.Tech students who had a reseach paper. She is such a kasi... Placementslo volunteerga vunnapudu tana confidence level choosa. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. Samvedana brought us closer. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> to her dedication. Can't forget those adv. cog sci classes. We used to go to classes just to through counters on each other.

<b><a href=samish.html>Samish Chandra Kolli</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>and finally for a would-be colleague <img src=Smileys/1.gif />...<br><br>In the very early days of IIIT, because of my PC being busy I sat at another one. I haven't noticed who is beside me until I heard the voice "Samish... neku idhi ela cheyalo thelusa", there she is Deepti... (donno why 'h' is missing from her name).<br><br>She was my co-TA for one semester, very very very very very very (and few more) hardworking and dedicated <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> girl with great visions. Her commitment is as strong as 'Rock of Gibraltar'. You know, she sat down uninterruptedly for long time to correct about 180 papers. <br><br>She hate to the most when one tries to call her 'kasi', but she is <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I will never the forget the fact that she wrote 5 midsem exams on one day in 5th semester <img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>May Ur dreams come to existence<br><br>All the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=karanmaroo.html>Karan</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Deeptizzzz....<br><br>I've seen some amazing transformations in her, all reflected from my interactions with her and her blog <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> . Earlier, she was this sweet little girl who thought too much about her relationships and could not handle the ups and downs. There were incidents in her life which changed it, and you can see it in her now.. The metro sexual babe next door! Swanky new hairstyle, stylish dresses and an altogether new confidence. She display's this dont-give-a-rat's-ass-to-losers around me attitude, which I must say is commendable. The way shes learnt and transformed herself is very nice to see.<br><br>But shes not just that, theres a lot more to her. Samvedana. It says a lot about her, doesn't it? I mean, you need to have a lot of will to give up a possible lucrative option for something you want to pursue for the society. And the best part of it all, shes been succesful in motivating people- each of them in their own ways. I still remember she urging us to join in, "Its not Jeevan Vidya.. " <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> For all the work done for it, hats off <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>I needn't mention about her acads here.. I remember all those days when we'd study in the reading room, and leofying her left, right and center. Shes also quite popular among her friends and accident prone <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Wish you all the best in life, May God shower his choicest blessing on Sam and you <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br><b>Fav memory: Leofying her in the reading room<br>Message for her: Never lose touch with yourself, and never change your basic self. </b><br><br>Peace.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Meet G P Deepti, the girl who has it all. One hell of a girl she is. I am yet to find a girl as witty as her. Her dedication and zeal towards her work can inspire laziest of the being. She is a chatterbox and always full of fun. Loves reading books and has a great taste for music. She is almost always involved in more than one work, and that means she is well too good at multitasking. She has a lovely heart which cannot see her friends in distress and would do whatever it takes to put a smile on their faces. And it doesnt stop here, her initiative to work for a social cause which gave birth to Samvedana is, I am sure, going to be a milestone in her life and will touch (up) many others. She involves her heart and soul in whatever she does. She likes to be tough on the outside, but she actually is very gentle from inside. She says that she is not sentimental but the ones close to her wont agree with it. This is about the girl I know best in IIIT and I cant help praising her for her awesomeness.<br>Now lets go back in time and see how we met. It was second or third semester, I recall we met in front of GH. I dont know how we met but I am glad we did. We had hardly talked to each other and even when we did we were in groups. She talked to me very freely and I listened to her intently. I think I gave her some advice, at which I must confess I am not very good, and I hope she found it useful. From then on we have tried to retain our friendship through the thick and things that we have been through. Sometimes she couldnt help and sometimes I screwed it up very badly. And now I am so glad that we managed to get through all of it. I still remember the feeling when she gave me a coffee cup on my birthday. I love coffee cups and I love birthday presents. Apparently I had mentioned to her that I like coffee cups and she remembered it. That was very sweet of you. I did or didnt do a few things that I shouldn't or should have done. I am still amazed how could she forgive me for all those stupidity so easily.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=snigam.html>Shrikant Nigam</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>I hope that our friendship wont see a dead end after college days, but I cant help fearing so. <br>I wish you all the luck and want you to know that I am there for you whenever you want me. <br>Please be in touch. May God bless you.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>...She gives <i>posan</i> like, she is the biggest Bewdi (Bew.D) in town but the thing is, she never has been in a circle of radius '1 feet' around any earthly brewerage. The way she (Haathi-mere-Saathi) hits people makes me wanna believe that she has got a black belt in Karate. You just don't feel bored when this rophal girlie's around, naanstaap taalking!!, paater-paater (yuck! and creepy at times when she acts like a Public Loudspeaker and tells my personal thoughts to another Public Loudspeaker called Harshita. I was refering to 70 MM) the biggest phone-chipkoo I've ever seen (you should take a break yaar. Kit-Kat break banta hai!) and she totally deserves an oscar for her acting <i> bahut naataka karti</i>, she is one bigg Drama Queen. The conversations we had were just<br>magical, we would never run out of topics to chat about. Although, I mostly talked and she listened (yes, I did check on and off for the glazed look of disinterest and boredom, and no, it wasn't there). Very Well, by any chance, if you feel bored in CIQ, no worries, Faculty Lounge/MSIT Balcony is the new Central Perk, we all can do some catching up there, yeah?<br> <br>Xx</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>...Lately, her beautiful mind started looking through those quirky specs. At one point of time <i>toh</i>, I was like "whoa! your blog should be titled as "My Life Through Gay Goggles", no offense. This <i>Chashmish</i> scares the faint-hearted with her "Shaitan ki Nani" laughter but always has this childlike charm on her face. Well, I should also say that she is a prodigal daugther who wears fancy-schmancy clothes, has voluminously curly hair and is a maha-shopaholic. Nowadays, she is feeling blue for absolutely no reasons (or of which I've no clue about). Anything could trigger it off, a dialogue, a song, a person, anything at all. Sometimes, her Telugu is so stellar I just stand amazed (ofcourse, I wanna learn it too). The biggest surprise of the century IS: how did I ever manage to SURVIVE eating the Gulab-Jumans she made. Dear Lord, that's what the food served in hell must taste like. Sometimes, you make me wanna believe in miracles re (I'm addressing to god over here). Anyways, the point is, the point is: I'm just kiddin' Deepti. No, no, really hear me out, they were pretty darn good da! I would also like to have a bit of 'bhaav' and some vada pav please (Fuck! I should really leave the rhyming thing to the "professionals").</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=gvsreddy.html>Siva Reddy</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Initially I was afraid to talk to her. I have the impression of her as a very studious girl who always study and not interested in talking to guys <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> (That time she is a 10 pointer <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> <img src=Smileys/77.gif />). But, she was the first to break the barrier of silence between us. One day when I am in library, she came and asked me something (I don't remember). I was happy then <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. My old impression started to erase slowly. <br><br>After knowing about her a lot through her blogs and other friends, I was amazed. She is just a normal girl like other girls who manages every aspect of life. This gained a lot of respect for her from my side.<br><br>During placements I got to know more about her. With her complete own effort, she secured herself a job. From that I able to knew how daring she is. Great <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>Her effort in establishing samvedana team is something which has to be appreciated. You are inspiring. I admire you a lot.<br><br>In the recent days, I was able to know more about her and she is very cool. She is good at pulling others legs. This time I won't give you a chance <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. I will be more assertive <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> as suggested by you. <br><br>All the best. Wish everything goes exactly as you anticipated.<br><br>Bye <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=pssschandra.html>P Sharat Chandra</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>From a gawky little girl wearing spectacles, all eager and dreamy-eyed, who entered the campus three summers ago to a Social Butterfly who definitely stands on a higher ground. This is the level of the seamless transition that Deepti has been through. She has become suitably indie. She has developed this great knack of either being right or <i>sounding</i> like she's right or refusing to believe she's </i>not<i> right, this sort of assertiveness is what Chaotic Minds like me appreciate a lot. As the time progressed, she also made clear that she'll Take No Shit when it comes to people she cares about which made her really special. If she wishes, she goes that extra mile to get things done. Saving-the-world types, an exceptionally brilliant person, as creative as one can get, she is the MISS I-CAN-DO-IT!</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>a very dedicated person...i used to wonder to see her go regularly to lab in d morning and work thr till dinner...<img src=Smileys/26.gif /><br><br>but whtever she does she gives her 100%...i still remember ur group's performance in SE...it was very impressive <img src=Smileys/41.gif /><br><br>she's very soft spoken, very humble, a god listener and a good speaker too... <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>recently her efforts to serve d society r worth appreciation...it can't b expressed in words...keep doing d same but do spare time 4 urselves...<br><br>wish u all d best in life and stay in touch <img src=Smileys/4.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=akasha.html>Akash Agrawal</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>She is one of the few girls in IIIT jinse main bat karta hoon. I will always remember those days of my intern at Philips Bangalore, when we used to have lunch together or wo bolti rahati thi or main sunta rahata tha ( main vese bhi bahut kam bolta hoon <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). She loves chit-chating. Very gud in studies, CG bolti hai <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Hindi thodi weak hai but quite manageable.<br><br>Best of luck for Samvedna and of course You<br>Keep smiling <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>

I was pretty close to her in the first two semesters (remember how we used to read physics in the lib ? going for movies after the mid sem exams ? )later .. again in the 6th semester we again became close friends . I donno y but I had the feeling that we somehow always share a special bond <img src=Smileys/4.gif />( Hmm .. not covalent bond but something more spl than that <img src=Smileys/5.gif /> ).<br><br>Deeps the very first thing both of us should regret is that randaka <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> .

<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 2 </b><br><br>Apart from all these, I also know that she's a very nice dancer. Oh! From dance, I remembered, actually that was how we met. " Kajra re ". It was completely out of sync (mainly becoz of the guys), but it was fun sharing stage with her. Actually the song was so good that nobody even cared to see if we were in sync or not. She also performed " Sharara ". Always performs on famous songs. There's one more dance that she has performed in first year Felicity. Whcih song was that? Mujhe yaad nahi aa raha. <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. and uske liye aaj bhi hum uski maarte rehte hain. Iske saath debate me lag jao, to ye sabki maarne lag jaati hai. Tab humare paas ek hi strong point hota hai. <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. btw, maine woh song ka naam kahin par bhi likha nahi hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>That was the fun part. Now coming to the serious part. Deepti is a very industrious, ambitious, striaght forward, intelligent, (thesaurus.com ke saare adjectives kahatam ho gaye kathe re. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) etc etc.<br><br>And now seriously coming to the serious part. Deepti is the girl who started "Samvedana" which became famous overnight and that too accross the seven seas. People from many countries want to contribute for it. It was indeed a great step taken towards the development of the needy people. I bow to thee for all the effort that you've put to take Samvedana to such great heights and my best wishes are with you and I'm pretty sure in the coming years, it gonna be a world-wide recognized organization. All the very best to you for this.<br><br>Aur ab mujhe lagta hai ki abhi tak maine kitna kuch likha but iska studies ke baare me nahi likha. To bhaiyon aur behnon, ek baat bata doon ki bandi studies me BOND hai (lady bond <img src=Smileys/4.gif />), fodu hai aur isne mujhe bahut help ki place hone me. <img src=Smileys/6.gif />. Thanks for all the moral support and your help re. <img src=Smileys/1.gif /><br><br>I think, now I should stop here. Abhi aur bohot logon ko likhna hai. So all the very best for your future. (this line is for formality <img src=Smileys/10.gif />). Milte rahenge, racha karte rahenge.<br><br>Aapka,<br>DJ Ranga <img src=Smileys/1.gif /></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=ranjalkar.html>Srirang Ranjalkar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b> part 1 </b><br><br>Her original name is verrry long. So we prefer to call her Deepti. People call her Deepu too. But for me Deepti is better and it sounds nice too! <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>Ok. So coming to Deepti. A hardcore gangsta!! Ekdum <b>"Yo baby!!"</b> types <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. And a hardcore Hyderabadi too. <b>"Hayein ! Maii haur Hyderabadi.. aree Kyaaa baatan karraa chicha?"</b> types <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She has got an awesome sense of humour and she's the best in pulling everyone's legs, especially on Twitter. <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. I like to tease her on her status messages. Sometimes, they are so funny and yet sometimes so sarcastic. I like the way she modifies English words and make them look so funny. (or rather "Phanni" <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. Ok. I didn;t want to write this but, tere students id me bhi ye word aata hai yaar.. chalta hai <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br><br>Her filmy knowledge. OMG!! <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. You see, I (djRanga), in my poore hosho-hawas, declare that thy knowledge on movies and Hindi dialogues is godlike and I can not stand in front of thee, when it comes to using right dialogue at the right time. <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. (meri English ko zara li8 lo.. thodi si gadbadi hai <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />)<br><br>DumbC! She was my partner in dumbC. We guessed 4/5 movie names in just 20 seconds. Last wale me thodi si chot ho gayi. But everyone was like "Wah! Kya practise hai .. kya practise hai" (OSO style <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). But seriously yaar, that day we rocked !!!<br><br>Her laptop is a dabba (ab accpet kar le yaar.. <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).

<b><a href=navatha.html>Navatha Tatineni</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Miss. Nautanki <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> Deepti is the one who is pretty close to me right from the first year at IIIT. May it be joy or sorrow, we both were always there for each other when one knocks the door of the other.<br><br>I remember every single day since we first met, right from the State Ranker's Meet at Sri Chaitanya to the "Samvedana" initiative today. She remained the same.. None of the circumstances could change her determination and dedication which have been her prime qualities. All that changed is her very beautiful curly hair into a bulky bunch of maggie noodles <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> But yeah, she could carry it off really well...<br><br>As she said, we both are pretty much the same when it comes to few things and not much the same when it comes to few others...I remember those days when I took the side of Ross and she of chandler's and Joey's and how each of us claimed our choice to be the best <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> <br><br>There were times when she used to tease me for taking hell lot of time to get dressed up when we are going out somewhere. But now, I take the privilege of adding her name next to mine <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> And she has this trait of not responding so well to our friendly hugs and hand-shakes <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I pity "The" Guy Deeps <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br><br>The perfection with which she does things is just awesome!!! And her sincere efforts to take Samvedana to greater heights are highly appreciable <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> <br><br>All the best Deeps.. Be the same and keep in touch.

<b><a href=aniketsharma.html>Aniket Sharma</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><b>You forego a lucrative career</b> in the US, in exchange for the dirt of Hyderabad. A decision which wouldn't particularly enthuse on first look anyone for whom you are the center of the universe. You then carry on with your idea. You swim against the the tide, something which is more strenous on your shoulders than swimming with it. Your life becomes a whirlpool of activity, when you were used to living in peace and quiet earlier. You make the humongous extra effort and end up with lot less money, lot less comfort, lot less leisure.<br><br><b>So why do you do it?</b><br><br>I bow to you Deepti, for the fact that you made me ask this question.<br>I bow to you, for the answer you would give to this question.<br><br>I've seen you but these three months. But you're tops in the list of the people who make me feel proud of my batch. You have unknowingly affected my, and several lives in unprecedented ways.

<b><a href=schand.html>Subhashis Chand</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Deeps<br>The relationship I have with this girl is of "respect". I have great respect for her. In the first year, I remember how much bothered she was about studies. Interestingly we had almost the same CG in the first year, but Ma'am then<br>crossed all bars, she is among the batch toppers now. This lady can go on working. I don't remember how many night out she had working in the lab. She and Maruti, showed me there R&D project looked phodu with graphics of Charminar<br>"but aage ka kuch samajh mein nahin aaya <img src=Smileys/10.gif />". One thing we share in common is love for Coffee, we would bump into each other at the coffee shop and ask each other "aaj ki kaun si hai?". My first year discussions with her always ended with "kitni aachi hai tu".<br>With her it has been different, we are not jigri dost types but whenever we have met we have talked like best friends. In the second year, we had a bad patch but things change for the<br>good. That was the time I felt, she trusted people easily and she was vulnerable. She has changed and changed for the good. For the later half of our college life we have maintained the same equation.

I used to dislike both Shikha and Prashasti in the initial phases of first year. This girl, since the first time I talked to her, have always been quite fond of her, which at times makes me wonder why isnt she among close friends of mine. I can ponder as long as I wish on this question and yet I wont be able to come up with an answer to the question.<br><br>She is also one of the people who believe in fodam-fadi when it comes to academics. 9 Point someone, Google women engineering award, went to Singapore in the exchange program and blah blah.

I mean two major accidents, are ladki samabhal ke raha kar na, kitne accidents karaegi re..<br><br>One problem I have with her is that she is a complete miser, been a TA for so many sems and abhich tak ek baar bhi mereku party nahin di <img src=Smileys/2.gif /> I remember there was some time in 3rd sem or so, when she promised me a party for sure and that party is still due.

She always greets you whenever you pass her and she always has this lovely smile on her face. These days she is doing a commendable job for "Samvedana" and hats off to you for that <img src=Smileys/77.gif />. I hope you will take it to greater heights. Matured upto an extent, very studious and maintains an awesome CG. She has something to her personality that draws people towards her. I always enjoy talking to her.<br><br>She is very hard working. One could always find her working in the lab in the 3rd year. It takes great courage to opt CVIT for your honours <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and she had that courage ^<img src=Smileys/2.gif />^. I feel she knows how to find happiness in whatever she does and this quality is the most adorable one.<br><br>There is more to write but couldn't find words to put into. I hope I'll write something more later. Recently I met with an accident and she was among those few peopleo always asked me how I was feeling.

She has this unusual machine through which she creates time.<img src=Smileys/77.gif /> I really dont know how you find time for so many activities but its simply superb the way you manage things. She gives the person talking to her an extra degree of freedom, which makes the conversation really smooth. She is a complete freak when it comes to Image Processing and her work is outstanding. She is such a good listener (Tell her some dialogue of Friends and she can tell you from which episode that dialogue is <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> Even Marta Kauffman and David Crane would do that <img src=Smileys/77.gif />). Her dedication to the work she takes is truly amazing. She keeps on working (on and on and on ...) until she is satisfied with what she is doing.  <br><br>For the first two years of engineering she belong to a band called 'kasi cat dolls' but due to some differences among the band members (just like any popular band), she left the band. She is super/uber/ultra cool person to hangout with and hits these awesome one-liners. Her sense of humor is something I really like about her. She loves commenting on everything she sees - (movie posters, couples being spatted, fat drivers/guys, some random guy on the road, shop names ... its a long list). She has this huge crush list but its divided by parts (only she can understand what it means) <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. By the way she is a shopping freak! Sometime I think she can read minds (are you from Planet E?). <br><br>I sincerely respect her a lot, be it the initiatives you take or the decisions you make(wow! that was rhyming, I'm improving).

<b><a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>But the best part is how she manages work. As far as managing work in general goes, I can say without doubt that Deepti is one step away from being ideal. I have often (and will happily, greedily and shamelessy) continue to bank on her for advice in this dept. She has always been critical of my slacking nature, best examples being the computer vision course and my C grade in it and the GE paper fiasco. I only hope that she never gives up on me. All in all, a great person from whom I've learnt a ton of stuff and I'm sure she would say the same about me. I'll never forget all the escapades we had like stalking girls, watching plays and the frequent outings to Reliance fresh. Looking back, going through all the stuff we did together (in FF mode), it really feels great to say that she's a great friend of mine. You go girl!!

<b><a href=sashidhar.html>sashidhar</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Apart from the usual exchanges of hi and hello, we never really talked to each other till the end of second year. That's when I, Maruti and Deepti were assigned project mates. At that time, all I knew about deepti was that she is this gal totally into studies and all. Our relation was on a very impersonal level and it continued to be so before changing to the bc stuff and all. Hell! I'll never know when the transition took place. Maybe the entire Felicity video making experience was a big catalyst but there were other things as well. Soon our discussion would be more of celebrity gossip, TV shows, news, etc. and less of project work. During the entire project episode, I came to know how very systematic she is, meticulously planning everything and making clearcut agendas and plans. A point worthy of mention here is that she can always be trusted for taking up responsibilities, whether it is organising some b'day party or getting people to come for a meeting.<br><br>I often use this technique of putting myself in the shoes of so and so person and thinking from his/her point of view. But in case of deepti, it has always been difficult for me because she is so radically different from me. I'm a born slacker. She is a born push-er and has it in her to push an idea and make sure it turns from something abstract (on paper or pdf or ppt) to something solid. She loves taking charge of things around her, being (a wee bit) bossy and all. Wait a minute! Did I say a wee bit bossy? She is so totally bossy!! Add to it her frankness. She will definitely give you her peice of mind if you don't work by her standards <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> Plus her fundaes.

<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>Contd..<br><br>She loves everything which is different. Be it spicy food or mass telugu songs, she loves to do everything hat-ke. Some incidents in her life has made her a strong social activist. Starting of by closing lights/fans in labs to helping out cash-strapped NGOs with her very own social group, Samvedana. The amount of work she has put behind Samvedana is awe-inspiring , thanks to her and others some NGOs are getting funds for helping people. <br><br>All in all she is the best-est friend one could ever have . She has been with me in many ups-and-downs in my life. The amount of care and affection I have received from her, I have never experienced so much from anyone except my family. The amount of time it takes to befriend her is very less,and before you know it you will start spilling out your beans <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br> <br> Looking at her hardworking nature and her leadership qualities, I am damn sure that she will take over the world pretty soon. To be honest, I owe her for everything I am today, Be it the google intern or the yahoo! job or the innumerable ( +ve <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> )changes in myself. I couldn't think of living with you. It will be really difficult for me to go bengaluru and be away from her. It makes me want to kick myself, for not having any interaction in Intermediate or the first sem in IIIT <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> .  <br><br>I wish her all the best in her future endeavors, and wish that I could be back with her in hyderabad or she comes to bangalore pretty soon. <br><br><b>Message to her</b> :- You are awesome ! Dont change yourself <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . <br><br><b> Character she resembles </b> :- Ariel from The Little Mermaid</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>contd... <br>We got hons. under the same prof. And plus, since we both didnot have any idea what to work on. PJN sir put us in the same project. That meant we were going to project partners till end of our B.techs. She is really hard-working, and because of her we were able to finish that awesome Charminar in about 10 days. <br><br>Sem 5 can be renamed as <b> CVIT-HELL </b> . She was very interested in the courses we took, Digital Image processing was her fav ( and it still is <img src=Smileys/26.gif /> ). Because of her hard work and commitment of doing something new, she found a way to make the best Median-Filter in the world <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . At first, I thought that this was crazy and went against her ( <img src=Smileys/51.gif /> ) . But still, she worked hard and showed me the results. I was amazed at the results. We met Jayanti ma'am and she said this could be a research paper. And you know what our paper got published in ICVGIP <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .<br><br>Sem6, was very cool we went to see lots of places in and around hyderabad. <i>Itne baar</i> she asked me to bring a bike, I would say next month/sem/week and <i>talo</i>fy her request <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . <br><br>Then came summers, she wanted to do an MS in one of the CVIT streams and I wanted to go for a job. That is why she did an intern in Philips Bangalore and Me at Google, Hyderabad. This was a tough time for her as she was all alone in Bangalore, plus we were working on our research paper at this time. She used to spend her weekends in Office just to finish work on our research paper. And on the other hand, also used to work on her Intern.  We had some couple of fights during this time, but we used to patch-up in minutes <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . Her work in the intern was commendable, and she nearly made it to SPIE ( but couldn't because her intern came to an end <img src=Smileys/2.gif />  ). <br><br>Contd...  </b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>contd... <br>then came second semester, this was the sem I actually started interacting with her. The max interaction was when we studied for Computer Organization. I found her very friendly and helpful. Even if i used to sleep off ( which I did repeatedly ), she used to explain me everything later <img src=Smileys/6.gif /> . We had lots of walks around the campus, and I found her to be coolest girl in IIIT <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> .<br><br>Then came 1st year summers, I stayed back at college for a summer project ( read using-free-internet-instead-of-going-home ). She visited me once, I really didn't expect her to come given the amount of interaction we had. I still remember those awesome gulab-jamuns which she brought along with her. She makes really good gulab-jamus <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( Aur kuch nahin aata <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> ) . <br><br>Then came third semester, she became one of my best friends. While the rest of college found us in study room during exams, we used to have lots of fun/BC and then try to seriously study <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . Lekin BC to hoti rahti ti <img src=Smileys/3.gif /> . <br><br>Sem 4, was the semester when we came very close to each other. She knew me in and out. I was so cool in front of her, I could tell her things which I couldnt tell any of my male-friends <img src=Smileys/77.gif /> . This isn't the case with me alone, so many friends open up to her so easily. I feel at ease when she is around, I can be just ME in front of her. Though it is kind of irritating for her to take all that sh*t from me <img src=Smileys/24.gif /> . <br><br>2nd year ke holidays mein, I had decided to apply for hons in CVIT and so did she. That summer was awesome, it made our friendship stronger and stronger. We tried out so many mess in and around indranagar. The dosas at balaji mess, the effed up Pottu ( or was it Putuu ) in kariyali, the IEG mess and of-course OBH FF . Raat mein we used to pluck raw-mangoes from the trees, work in the night and then go to IDLI-waala in Indranagar. <br>Contd....</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=samrat.html>Kubera Samrat</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the most studious girls I have seen. I first met her as an Agnian. She has got some different style of worse humour in the early days of IIIT. But now she changed a lot. It became even worserhttp://172.17.8.64/yearbook/Smileys/24.gif <br><br>Very sensitive. She was very friendly and sometimes I feel she is very smooth, beautiful and delicate glass to handle. I still remember the days when I gave tips for running in sports meet and she got prize as well. She was well known in IIIT for accidents.<br> One should get inspired for her work nature, helping nature, cultural activities and leaving many more for the people to explore.<br>My hearty wishes for the future.</b></i></ul><br><br>

<b><a href=maruti.html>Maruti Borker</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br><i>Ek dum mein to pura nahin likh paunga</i> .. parts parts <i>mein likhte hain</i> <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>I knew her before I came to IIIT. We were in the same JAIL ( Sri Chaitanya Narayanguda ). <i> Lekin </i>, I didn't talk to her even once ! She was the most phodu-est student in the whole narayanguda branch. Lecturers used to curse us ( i.e guys ), for getting so low marks which were of no comparison to what she was getting. I thought she was very idealistic, she used to have fun and also study at the same time. She used to sit in the corner-most seat on the last bench with her gal-pal <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . There was not a single week in which she was not 1st in the campus. That is quite an achievement ! When she used to get lesser marks, she would never cry/feel bad like other girls used to <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br><br>In IIIT, in 1st sem I think we rarely had any interaction. One incident which I remember is during submissions of our ITWS personal websites. She said "hey, Nice work. Your website looks good". <i>Mein to</i> 0-interaction with girls <i>waala</i>, said thanks and ran off from that place <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. <br><br> I still laugh at my stupidity, and the my problem of not able to interact with girls before meeting her <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <i>Agar </i> by any chance I make any GF in Bengaluru , She will be the first person I should thank to <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>Baaki ek bade se break ke baad .... <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> . <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b><a href=namrata.html>Namrata Suri</a></b>&nbsp;wrote-<br>One of the coolest girls around, I did not know her that well in the first two years but now that I know her well enough <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> , I think I can safely say that she is a wonderful person who is more than just a stud at acads <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. She is a lot of fun and her tweets keep me entertained all the time. <br><br>         Her dedication and willingness to go that extra mile for things that matter to her is a great quality and something I respect her for. From dancing during Freshers 05 to Dj nite Felicity 09 <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> , our friendship has come a long way and I hope she fulfills all her ambitions and goals because she deserves it.
