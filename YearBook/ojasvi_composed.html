<br><br><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Randeep in general has a very calm , matured and a sweet personality. So sweet that he had to face teh axe of Bc for full 2 years, just because he won't <br>reply back partially for the fear of hurting anybody ( partially ue to the fact he had no answers <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) though it did hurt him a lot of times. but whatever it hurt him or not he nevr refused help to anybody ever.<br><br> <br>Having said all this, this is not what makes randeep what he is. What's so soecial about him is his pursuit for the ultimate truth.<br>His passion and zeal for knowledge far beyond other's reach. a tru sikh that's randeep for you. He has done commendable job along with dharmeet in the social service sector. Having said this he is subject to influence and was a nig time frusto due to gkB's aura in 2nd year. Thank God he got out quickly.<br><br>The time I spent with him in M$ was simply awesome. All the bakar we two did, pool and foosball matches we played and jo siyapa hamne paya hein together. The volleyball and tennis games <img src=Smileys/4.gif /> . Best times ever. Remember the cricket match we watched together? Chips , coke and 43 inch screen on ultra cool sofa set's and discussing how life is so good.<br><br>I think we ahve a special connection. Remember teh fight we had and the shopping sprees <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ( read the testi he worte for me for details ).<br><br>WIll Miss you for:Won't miss you , u ain't going anywhere <img src=Smileys/4.gif /><br>Most memorable moment:M$ and tutes   <br>Msg for u:learn to say no ( not to me though <img src=Smileys/10.gif />)<br>Song for u: ramta jogi ..<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>One of the qualities that defines Randeep is sacrifice. He will sacrifice sleep , food and almost anything else for his studies. He will<br>sacrifice his time and rest for teaching anybody who comes to his door for a last minute tute. Unlike others, he will give all he has  <br>and would genuinly teach everybody. In some ways I owe my degree to randeep. I remember the day before dld final exam. I had fared bad in first mid<br>-sem and played cz all day on this day. At 12.00 in night I turn up to banga and say teach me,Banga has been working all day and is tired and about to<br>sleep but when I said I don't know anything at all. He taught me  ( but we both fell asleep in 15 min and covered teh whole dld in half an hout next<br>morning <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> ). By his efforts I passed in DLd ( C my lowest <img src=Smileys/10.gif />) . It was impoosible to pass any of the maths course without him either. Another example of his<br>dedication and sacrificing nature is teh effort he put in for placments. He was the only one who listened to even GAG seriously.<br><br>He is among the most dedicated people in IIIT. he is actually too dedicated <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, to such an extent that it frustoo's others <br>( read karan's testi). He can do almost anything for a good grade, used to study till he literally fell asleep. His room open, <br>tublight on, he with notes his hand and his mouth open sleeping is a very common sight in exam days. When ever I saw him like this I used to turn of the lights, wake him up and tell him to close the door and sleep but he wakes up too much he will study again <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> such is his dedication <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. But if thi all <br>fails he will go the extent of patofying teachers for an A <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. <br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=rsbanga.html>Randeep Singh Banga</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Randeep Singh Banga Aka banga is among my best friends in IIIT and one of the most poupular <br>guys in the batch. Randeep is gem of a person, he is like a tresure pile full of virtues, a tree which <br>gives shade to everybody who comes towards him. He is among the very very few people in life to whom I<br>might turn up when I feel like things are not going right ( almost never <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ) or when I need advice.<br>Someone with who I can share everything, someone I can turn to when things aren't that right.<br><br>Like most of my friends in IIIT, I and randeep started on a wrong foot, but gradually things got better and<br>we became best friends. I think one of the factors which brought us closer was that we both have a well thought <br>out religious viewpoint of life and also we both were frustrated by our roomies <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. Randeep's popularity in the batch is legendary <br>We all remember all the "banga banga" chants in the classes. Infact a lot of people didn't knew randeep by face but everybody <br>knew "banga". He is one of the most genuine sweet persons I have ever met and it shows in his every action. He laughs with u when u are happy<br>and soothes u when u are sad.He is very sensitive about people's feelings and nevr hurt anybody ( just like alok <img src=Smileys/10.gif />).<br> No wonder he is so popular among batchmates.<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=alokkumar.html>Alok Kumar Gautam</a></b>&nbsp;<br>ALok Kumar is among my best friends  in IIIT, Someone who has stood by me all these years. Thank you for that. First look, he looks like a typical bihari gunda but he is the exact opposite once u get to know him. Let me tell u something about Alok. This guy is not very good in studies, he is literally afraid to talk to girls, above average  in  BC, has a avg job. Exceptionally hardworking but has been low on self confidence ( though has improved a lot on recent times ), below avg gamer. Tried gyming with avg success again. What I mean to say he is the avg Joe in all things I know except a very few things. Which are being good at heart, being dependable, being trustworthy, to sum up in being a friend ( just look at all the testimonials below)</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=vivekprakash.html>Vivek Prakash</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Just one word <br>"Bond"<br>It defines him better then any testimonial I could write.</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Has a very nice philosophical side too. one of the few people with whom I can share books on Vivekananda and stuff, still reads Gita sometime and has some very <br><br>nice books. but all in martahi. Is very calm and composed, knows what he wants from life and tries to achive that. Beech mein kuch time ke liye chahca ka <br><br>student ban gaya tha ye sab chod ke, Thank God wapis aa gaya time pe <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> <br><br>One of teh best things about him is his uber cool attitude. u can always find a smile gracing his lips. has a grace that calms the whole enviroment <br><br>around him. One of teh few persons jo mere phatto pe bhi hasta hein and promotes them too <img src=Smileys/10.gif />( quadra core <img src=Smileys/4.gif />). Had alot of fun in playing comp games with him . He being a lazy guy  won't move his hands fast enough and hence will lose the game but will never lose the smile <img src=Smileys/21.gif />.Had lot of fun in recent time watcing TBBT with u. Is a real sport, has been the host of few of the  best parties we had. Overall banda ek dum mast hein. Chilled to the core <img src=Smileys/3.gif />. Now he is among the only few in the group with no female friend. Hope he gets a marathi pretty soon <br><br><br>WIll Miss you for: Watching TBBT with u, kamehameha , my Pj's and u laughing on them and obviously for the knoweldge bacnk u are <br>Most memorable moment:first year age, ceaser and similar games , Tbbt  <br>Msg for u: perfection stay the same<br>Song for u: mein huin bond</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=ankush.html>Ankush Kalkote</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br>Ankush Ashok kalkote:<br><br>Maratha that's the name I normally call him with. I first met him most prob in pankaj's room. He and pankaj used to study together. I think he used to <br><br>grimace and get uncofortable around me in the start.  I remember hiw he was reading a book on robotics in the very first week in library and how I pulled his <br><br>leg on that for a long time. He was very very angery at me for that (In my defense I never knew this will amke him angery <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> ). But besde thesse early <br><br>hiccups oer friendship grew strong over years and now we are great pals.<br><br>First look at ankush and he looks like a sweet , inncocent child and he indeed is <img src=Smileys/13.gif />,  yeah yeah yeah u might not belive it but I can prove it. Who else will <br><br> come to my room when I am "goku" and say "ojas ek bar wo ka me ha me ha" phir se kar ke dikha na <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, who else will sit beside somebody playing a computer <br><br>game for hours and watch the game. We even scrwed a mid term exam in sem 2 together me playing ceaser 3 and he watching me thanks for all that. Had great fun So yes  he is a child and when he is I am his best friend <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He has a very calm soothing voice I am sure he will sing wonderful matahi lullabyes to his children. ( he <br><br>sung one to me once too on request<img src=Smileys/10.gif />). one of the best things about this guy his the way he gives u moral support for doing all the stupid stuff u wanna do <br><br><img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He even joins u in it.Perfect pal <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. One of the worst:- 18 ghante lagatar so sakta hein <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br><br>Hmm iske tutes to legendary hein. One of the most gifted brains in IIIT. and kattha bhi mast hein pata bhi nahi chlata. Google is lucky to have him. ( wisj u <br><br>were in my team in MS <img src=Smileys/1.gif /> ). Bande ne bina padhe IIM crack kiya. Baki sare batch ne 4 saal mehnat ki bande ne 4 din and he still scored better <img src=Smileys/13.gif />. Has a innate understanding for subjects other run from ( CO , DLD , EC etc etc!!). I remember the diagram in Co which u made for CO and the whole copied it but noboy could understand a thing <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> and despite all this nobody ever heard a proud word for him<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />^<img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><br><br>Is prud of his culture and language. Regularly reads Martahi and tecahes it ( taught me a bit, but ganja is his fav student) Has a very nice philosophical side too. one of the few people with whom I can share books on Vivekananda and stuff, still reads Gita sometime and has some very <br><br>nice books. but a</b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sachingoyal.html>Sachin</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Sachin Aka Icshan is one of the few people around with whom I think I can share everything. He is among the very few about whom I was sure that he will land in a good job despite the recession. Simply said someone who I always believed had a lot of potenial. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />. <br><br>Owing to my bad memory with people and places <img src=Smileys/2.gif />.I don't really remember when I met him first <img src=Smileys/2.gif />. But I think I really bonded with him during our trips to paradise for biryani. He is more or less a symbol for cool and chilled attitude in our group ( actually almost the entire batch <img src=Smileys/3.gif />). Never lets anything bother with his masti. big tim foodie and sleeps a lot !! ( He and ankush used to sleep for 15-16 hours straight !!! ). Salla kumbhkaran bhi sharma jaye <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. He has a sharp learning curve and it was fun playing all sort of pc games with him <img src=Smileys/4.gif />. He is real pro in small flash games( had the best highscore in all of them <img src=Smileys/13.gif /> <img src=Smileys/41.gif /> ). Big time movie freak ( I think he has watched the highest no of movies in IIIT, though I told him a lot but never tried anime <img src=Smileys/20.gif /> ) He has watched DDlJ like a 100 times <img src=Smileys/24.gif />. <br><br>Coming to skills he is good in acads ( smart study personified, he is known to get more marks then people who teach him <img src=Smileys/10.gif /> I think he even had 2 marks more then me in physics 2 <img src=Smileys/14.gif /> which I taught ), awesome in bc and unbelievable in making friends. If u wanna have fun stick with him. <img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif /><img src=Smileys/77.gif />.<br><br>He is prone to mood swings which I think are natural but he manages them well and comes out string as ever. Another thing I admire about him is his "parkhi nazar". he is excellent at analyzing persons , places and events.<br><br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=abhinavp.html>Abhinav Parashar</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhinav Parashar aka Paro aka Srk is one of the most friendly person of our batch. He looves camera and would do almost anything for a pic <img src=Smileys/10.gif />. A rare person who is actually good at heart. Had a lot of fun with him at Goa. Total mastiKhor and a stud when it comes to girls. I have seen him not getting bogged down by placments and coming back strong. I admire him for that. I think what's common among is that we both dream big and while doing so have a sense of responsibility.<br>Will Miss U for:- bakar , masti and your spooky stories <img src=Smileys/10.gif />.<br>Most Memorable moment:- Goa Trip<br>Msg for U: Keep in touch<br>Song for u:- yahoo...<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
<b>For <a href=sainani.html>Abhishek Sainani</a></b>&nbsp;<br>Abhishek Sainani is one person u cannot easily forget. He has a child like face and talk very softly. Has a great knack for cracking very good phatte and irritating people, but what i like most about this person is his ability to think outside the box and challenge the known realities as such. He is Tv buff and has watched almost every single Tv series.( sitcoms and dramas) He is an excellent poet and an impressive writer.<br><b>Will Miss U for :- Discussions with u on super heroes <img src=Smileys/10.gif />, Midnight food.<br>Most Memorable moment :- Batch trip.<br>Msg for U:- Be more Confident.<br>Song for u:-  mera joota heinjapani..<br></b></i></ul><br><br>
